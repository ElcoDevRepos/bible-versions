The context is God's promise of restoration and renewal for Israel, following their exile due to disobedience. The act of remembering is significant in biblical terms, often associated with repentance and a turning back to God (e.g., <a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>). The "evil ways and wicked deeds" refer to the idolatry and rebellion against God's commandments, which led to their judgment and exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). This remembrance is not merely intellectual but involves a deep, heartfelt acknowledgment of sin.<p><b>and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and abominations</b><br>The loathing of oneself for past sins signifies a profound level of repentance and contrition. In the Hebrew culture, this self-loathing is an expression of genuine remorse and a desire for purification (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>). The terms "iniquities" and "abominations" highlight the severity of their sins, often associated with idolatry and practices detestable to God (<a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26-30</a>). This self-loathing is a necessary step towards spiritual renewal and aligns with the prophetic theme of a new heart and spirit, as seen earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>. It also foreshadows the New Testament call to repentance and transformation through Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, calling them to repentance and promising restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who were in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry, are the primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>A significant period in Israel's history when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_restoration.htm">God's Promise of Restoration</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/36.htm">Ezekiel 36</a>, God promises to restore Israel, cleanse them from their impurities, and give them a new heart and spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_self-loathing.htm">Repentance and Self-Loathing</a></b><br>The emotional and spiritual response God desires from the Israelites as they recognize their past sins and turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_repentance.htm">The Necessity of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves recognizing and turning away from sin, as seen in the Israelites' self-loathing for their iniquities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_transformative_power.htm">God's Transformative Power</a></b><br>God promises to cleanse and renew His people, emphasizing His ability to transform hearts and lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-reflection_and_humility.htm">Self-Reflection and Humility</a></b><br>Believers are called to examine their lives, acknowledge their sins, and approach God with humility and contrition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_memory_in_repentance.htm">The Role of Memory in Repentance</a></b><br>Remembering past sins can lead to genuine repentance and a deeper appreciation of God's grace and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hope_of_restoration.htm">The Hope of Restoration</a></b><br>Despite past failures, God's promise of restoration offers hope and encouragement for a renewed relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_36_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 36:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_36_31_Reflect_on_past_sins.htm">How does Ezekiel 36:31 encourage self-reflection on past sins and actions?

Only after this gracious work does true remembrance happen.<p>&#8226; Remembering here is Spirit-energized insight, similar to Israel&#8217;s future recollection in <a href="/ezekiel/16-61.htm">Ezekiel 16:61-63</a> and the prodigal &#8220;coming to himself&#8221; in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>.<p>&#8226; This is not nostalgia; it is sober recognition of sin, as Solomon pictured in national repentance (<a href="/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your evil ways and wicked deeds</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Evil ways&#8221; points to long-standing patterns; &#8220;wicked deeds&#8221; highlights specific acts.

He refuses to soften sin with polite labels (<a href="/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The new heart now recoils at what once felt normal. Conversion rewrites memories from trophies of self to proof of grace (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will loathe yourselves</b><p>&#8226; Loathing is deep disgust at the old self, not self-hatred that leads to despair. It is the &#8220;godly sorrow&#8221; that produces repentance without regret (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Job experienced this: &#8220;I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Such revulsion is evidence that the promised new heart is beating.

Daniel confessed in similar terms (<a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s catalog of what He calls abomination&#8212;idolatry, sexual immorality, injustice, pride&#8212;remains unchanged (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing sin&#8217;s ugliness magnifies the beauty of grace. The more vividly we see our guilt, the more we treasure Christ&#8217;s cleansing (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/36-31.htm">Ezekiel 36:31</a> describes the Spirit-led aftermath of God&#8217;s saving work: His people, newly cleansed and indwelt, look back on their former lives with clear eyes.
