Extortion and robbery were common practices, indicating a society that had strayed far from God's laws. In the Mosaic Law, theft and dishonest gain were strictly prohibited (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). The phrase "people of the land" refers to the general populace, suggesting that these sins were not limited to the leaders but were pervasive throughout society. This reflects a breakdown of social and moral order, similar to the conditions described in the time of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>They have oppressed the poor and needy</b><br>The oppression of the poor and needy is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where God expresses His concern for justice and care for the vulnerable (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>). The poor and needy were often victims of systemic injustice, lacking the means to defend themselves. This behavior was a direct violation of God's commands to care for the less fortunate (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). The prophets frequently condemned such actions, emphasizing that true worship of God includes justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>and have exploited the foreign resident without justice.</b><br>Exploiting the foreign resident, or "sojourner," was particularly egregious because the Israelites themselves had been foreigners in Egypt. God commanded them to treat foreigners with kindness and fairness (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>). The lack of justice for foreigners indicates a society that had forgotten its own history and God's commands. This exploitation is a sign of a hardened heart, contrasting with the inclusive vision of God's kingdom where all nations are blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The call for justice for foreigners is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are reminded to show hospitality and love to strangers (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often focusing on their sins and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the inhabitants of Judah, who are being accused of various social injustices and moral failings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_and_needy.htm">The Poor and Needy</a></b><br>Vulnerable groups within society who are being oppressed and exploited, contrary to God's commands for justice and mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foreign_resident.htm">The Foreign Resident</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who were supposed to be treated with fairness and justice according to Mosaic Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these injustices are taking place, representing the spiritual and moral state of the nation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_for_justice.htm">The Call for Justice</a></b><br>God demands justice and righteousness from His people.
