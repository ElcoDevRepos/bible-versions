Egypt, in biblical symbolism, represents a place of bondage and idolatry. The Israelites' "playing" suggests engaging in idolatrous practices, which were prevalent in Egyptian culture. This period is significant as it sets the stage for Israel's recurring struggle with idolatry, even after their deliverance from Egypt. The imagery of playing can be linked to the Israelites' later worship of the golden calf (Exodus 32), showing a pattern of spiritual unfaithfulness.<p><b>prostituting themselves from their youth</b><br>The metaphor of prostitution is used throughout the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God. From their "youth," or early history, the Israelites were drawn to the pagan practices of surrounding nations. This phrase underscores the idea that Israel's spiritual infidelity began early in their national history, even before they became a distinct nation. The use of "prostituting" highlights the gravity of their actions, as they were meant to be in a covenant relationship with God, akin to a marriage (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>).<p><b>Their breasts were fondled there</b><br>This vivid imagery emphasizes the intimate nature of Israel's idolatry. It suggests a deep entanglement with the pagan practices of Egypt, indicating not just casual involvement but a profound and personal level of spiritual corruption. This can be seen as a metaphor for how deeply the Israelites were influenced by Egyptian culture and religion, which later affected their worship practices even in the Promised Land (<a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7-8</a>).<p><b>and their virgin bosoms caressed</b><br>The phrase "virgin bosoms" implies purity and innocence that were lost through idolatrous practices. The caressing of their bosoms symbolizes the seduction and allure of pagan worship, which led Israel away from their devotion to God. This imagery serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the loss of spiritual purity. It also foreshadows the continued struggle of Israel with idolatry, as seen in their history of turning to other gods (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names given to Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively, representing the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel.
