The bull, being a valuable and strong animal, represented a significant sacrifice, indicating the seriousness of sin and the need for reconciliation with God. This offering is part of the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of all sin offerings (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>to the Levitical priests</b><br>The Levitical priests were descendants of Levi, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, specifically chosen to perform the duties of the priesthood. They were responsible for the rituals and sacrifices in the temple, acting as mediators between God and the people. This priestly role is a precursor to the priesthood of all believers in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>who are of the family of Zadok</b><br>Zadok was a priest during the time of King David and King Solomon, known for his faithfulness and loyalty. The family of Zadok was chosen to continue the priestly line due to their steadfastness, especially during times of apostasy. This lineage is significant as it represents a faithful remnant, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, highlighting God's preservation of a faithful people (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>).<p><b>who approach Me to minister before Me</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the role of the priests as those who draw near to God on behalf of the people. Approaching God required holiness and obedience, as the priests were to be set apart for sacred duties. This concept of drawing near to God is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus, our High Priest, who grants believers access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration underscores the authority and sovereignty of God in establishing the rules and regulations for worship and sacrifice. It is a reminder that the instructions given are not merely human traditions but divine commands. The phrase "declares the Lord GOD" is a common prophetic formula, affirming the authenticity and seriousness of the message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving God's instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priests.htm">Levitical Priests</a></b><br>Descendants of Levi, tasked with temple duties and sacrifices.

The service began with the offering of a sin offering, which was always, according to the law, to be first offered when several kinds of sacrifice were to occur together.

This injunction, which was addressed to Ezekiel, not as the representative of the people or of the priests (Smend), but as the prophet of Jehovah, made it clear that Ezekiel was not to act in the future consecration of the altar alone as Moses did in the dedication of the tabernacle altar, but that the priests were to bear their part in the ceremonial. If some expressions, as the use of "thou" in this and the following verses, appear to suggest that Ezekiel alone should officiate, the employment of "they" in vers. 22, 24, 25, 26 as plainly indicates that Ezekiel's share in the ceremonial was to be performed through the medium of the priests. And, indeed, if the temple was a pattern designed to be converted into an actual building after the return from captivity, as the newer criticism contends, it is apparent that Ezekiel could not have been expected to have any hand in its erection. <span class="cmt_word">The Levites that be of the seed of Zadok</span>.
