It emphasizes the humanity of the prophet in contrast to the divine nature of God. The term "son of man" is also used in the New Testament, particularly in reference to Jesus Christ, highlighting His incarnation and role as the representative of humanity. In Ezekiel's context, it underscores his role as a human messenger among the people of Israel.<p><b>He said to me,</b><br>The speaker here is God, who directly communicates with Ezekiel. This divine communication is a hallmark of prophetic literature, where God often speaks directly to His chosen messengers. The personal nature of this address indicates a direct and intimate relationship between God and Ezekiel, setting the stage for the prophet's mission.<p><b>stand up on your feet</b><br>This command signifies readiness and respect in the presence of God. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, standing was a posture of attention and readiness to receive instruction or commission. It contrasts with the typical posture of worship or supplication, which was often kneeling or prostrate. This command indicates that Ezekiel is being prepared for active service and engagement in his prophetic role.<p><b>and I will speak to you.</b><br>God's promise to speak to Ezekiel highlights the importance of divine revelation. The communication of God's word is central to the prophetic mission, as the prophet is tasked with conveying God's messages to the people. This phrase assures Ezekiel of God's guidance and the authority of the message he is to deliver. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God choosing and equipping individuals to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the callings of other prophets like Moses and Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is commissioning Ezekiel for his prophetic mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel receives his calling, a time when the Israelites were in captivity in Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_calling_and_readiness.htm">Divine Calling and Readiness</a></b><br>God calls Ezekiel to stand, symbolizing readiness and respect.

The verse teaches that God chooses ordinary people, empowers them by His Spirit, and equips them with His word to fulfill extraordinary missions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Son of man.</span>--The voice that now came to Ezekiel was articulate, and spoke to him in words which he could understand. It is not said who it was that spoke, but the "He" in connection with the vision before him could be none other than the Most High, whose glory that vision was given to reveal. The phrase "son of man" is common enough throughout the Scriptures, as meaning simply <span class= "ital">man, </span>but is never used in an address to a prophet, except to Ezekiel and Daniel. To Daniel it is used only once (<a href="/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>), while to Ezekiel it is used above ninety times. The reason is, doubtless, that since he was the prophet of the captivity he was addressed in the common terms of the language where he lived. "Son of man" for "man" is so common in the Aramaic languages that it is even used of Adam himself in the Syriac version of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1Corinthians 15:45-47</a>. The address to Ezekiel here as "man," just as under similar circumstances to Daniel when he had fallen upon his face through awe of the supernatural presence (<a href="/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a>), is doubtless in compassion to his weakness. And then comes the strengthening command, "Stand upon thy feet," that he may be able to receive the communication God is about to make to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Son of man,</span> etc. It is noticeable that the phrase (<span class="accented">ben adam</span>), as addressed to a prophet, occurs only in Ezekiel, in whom we find it not less than eighty times, and in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>. As used elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>; <a href="/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>, and in Ezekiel's use of it, it is probably connected with the history of Adam, as created from the ground (<span class="accented">adamah</span>) in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>. The prophet is reminded, in the very moment of his highest inspiration, of his Adam nature with all its infirmity and limitations. In the use of a like phrase (<span class="accented">bar enosh</span>, instead of <span class="accented">ben adam</span>) in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> we have the same truth implied. There one like unto man in all things is called to share the sovereignty of the "Ancient of Days," the Eternal One. Here the prophet, nothing in himself, is called to be the messenger of God to other sons of men. It is in many ways suggestive that our Lord should have chosen the same formula for constant use when speaking of himself (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span> in the Gospels). <span class="cmt_word">Stand upon thy feet.</span> The attitude of adoration is changed, by the Divine command, into that of expectant service, that of awe and dread for the courage of a soldier of the Lord of hosts (compare the parallels of <a href="/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>;
