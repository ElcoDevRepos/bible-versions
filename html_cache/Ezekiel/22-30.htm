In the context of Ezekiel, God is addressing the moral and spiritual decay of Israel. The search for a "man" suggests a leader or intercessor who could advocate for the people, similar to figures like Moses or Abraham who interceded for Israel in the past (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>). This highlights the importance of righteous leadership in times of national crisis.<p><b>to repair the wall</b><br>The imagery of repairing a wall suggests restoring protection and integrity to the community. In ancient cities, walls were crucial for defense against enemies. Spiritually, this represents the need to restore moral and spiritual defenses that have been breached by sin and idolatry. Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild Jerusalem's walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>) serve as a historical parallel, emphasizing the need for both physical and spiritual restoration.<p><b>and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land</b><br>Standing in the gap implies intercession and advocacy. The "gap" represents a breach in the community's spiritual defenses, where judgment could enter. This role is akin to a priestly function, mediating between God and the people. The concept of intercession is seen throughout Scripture, with Christ ultimately fulfilling this role as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>so that I should not destroy it</b><br>This phrase underscores God's desire for repentance and restoration rather than judgment. It reflects His mercy and willingness to relent from sending calamity if there is genuine repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>). The conditional nature of divine judgment is a recurring theme, where God seeks reasons to spare rather than destroy (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>).<p><b>But I found no one</b><br>The absence of a righteous intercessor highlights the depth of Israel's spiritual decline. This echoes the lament in <a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>, where God is appalled at the lack of justice and intercession. It foreshadows the need for a perfect intercessor, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who stands in the gap for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The failure to find such a person in Ezekiel's time serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of widespread unrighteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often focusing on their sin and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, specifically during a time of moral and spiritual decay, leading to God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall.htm">The Wall</a></b><br>Symbolic of protection and defense, representing the spiritual and moral boundaries that have been broken down due to Israel's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gap.htm">The Gap</a></b><br>Represents the breach in the spiritual and moral defenses of Israel, a place where intercession and leadership are desperately needed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one seeking an intercessor to stand in the gap, highlighting His desire for repentance and restoration rather than destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_for_intercessors.htm">The Call for Intercessors</a></b><br>God actively seeks individuals who will intercede on behalf of others.

God is never passive about sin; He looks for partners willing to step in with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among them</b><p>The candidate had to rise from within the corrupt society, not arrive as an outsider. Ezekiel&#8217;s chapter details four guilty groups&#8212;<p>&#8226; priests who &#8220;do violence to My law&#8221; (22:26)<p>&#8226; officials who &#8220;shed blood&#8221; (22:27)<p>&#8226; prophets who white-wash lies (22:28)<p>&#8226; the people who &#8220;oppress&#8221; one another (22:29)<p>Yet God still looked &#8220;among them,&#8221; proving He prefers restoration to abandonment (cf. <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to repair the wall</b><p>Sin had knocked holes in the nation&#8217;s moral fortifications. The Lord wanted someone &#8220;who would build up the wall&#8221; (22:30). In Scripture, walls picture protection and order (<a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>). Where holiness collapses, judgment pours in. A righteous believer&#8217;s obedience and influence can re-lay the bricks of truth, justice, and worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stand in the gap before Me</b><p>More than masonry is in view; God longs for an intercessor. Moses once &#8220;stood before Him in the breach&#8221; and turned wrath away (<a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). Abraham pleaded for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>). Samuel regarded intercession as a sacred duty (<a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>). The &#8220;gap&#8221; is the open breach where divine judgment is already advancing, and the intercessor plants himself between God&#8217;s holiness and the people&#8217;s sin&#8212;appealing to mercy while upholding righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on behalf of the land</b><p>Failure in Jerusalem would bring devastation to the whole territory. God ties blessing of the land to covenant obedience (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>). When Israel sinned, &#8220;the land mourned&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>). Yet He promised, &#8220;If My people&#8230;humble themselves and pray&#8230;I will heal their land&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The intercessor&#8217;s burden is broader than personal survival; it is national repentance and renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that I should not destroy it</b><p>Judgment was not God&#8217;s first choice; mercy was (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). He would gladly withhold destruction if righteousness emerged. Peter later affirms the same heart: the Lord is &#8220;not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/22.htm">Ezekiel 22</a> shows holiness and compassion meeting: judgment is deserved, yet deliverance is available&#8212;if a mediator can be found.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I found no one</b><p>Tragically, not one qualified person stepped forward. The scene recalls <a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>&#8212;&#8220;I looked, but there was no one to help.&#8221; Humanity&#8217;s universal failure (<a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2-3</a>; <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>) highlights the eventual need for a perfect Mediator. In Christ, God Himself provides what He sought: &#8220;For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), who &#8220;always lives to intercede&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). Ezekiel&#8217;s unfilled gap points prophetically to the Cross where Jesus stood alone, absorbing wrath so salvation could flow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a> reveals God&#8217;s yearning to spare a guilty people through the faithfulness of one intercessor. He looked within the nation, desired the wall of righteousness rebuilt, called for someone to brave the breach, and offered mercy instead of destruction. No one met the need, exposing Israel&#8217;s spiritual bankruptcy and foreshadowing the ultimate Intercessor, Jesus Christ. The verse invites every believer today to step into prayerful, obedient service, guarding their communities with lives that rebuild broken walls and point others to the Savior who finally filled the gap.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Make up the hedge, </span>is only another form of "stand in the gap," added for the sake of emphasis.
