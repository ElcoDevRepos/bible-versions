In the context of Ezekiel's ministry, this phrase underscores the authority and authenticity of the message that follows. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet during the Babylonian exile, often received visions and messages from God to convey to the Israelites. This particular message is part of a larger allegory involving two eagles and a vine, symbolizing the political alliances and betrayals of Judah. The phrase "the word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating that what follows is not merely human insight but divine instruction. This is consistent with other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Isaiah, where God directly communicates His will and plans. The phrase also highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people, tasked with delivering messages of warning, judgment, and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's messages and visions, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, Yahweh, who communicates His will and judgments through His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, where the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon as a result of their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses nations and events to accomplish His purposes.
