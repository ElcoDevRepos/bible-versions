In the context of Ezekiel, Israel is called to remember its past sins and idolatry, which led to their exile. The act of remembering is not merely cognitive but involves a deep emotional response, leading to shame and repentance. This is consistent with the prophetic tradition where recalling past transgressions is a step towards restoration (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>). The shame mentioned here is not meant to condemn but to bring about a transformation and return to God.<p><b>when you receive your older and younger sisters</b><br>The "older and younger sisters" refer to the nations of Samaria and Sodom, which are used symbolically to represent Israel's sinful neighbors. Historically, Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and Sodom is infamous for its destruction due to wickedness (Genesis 19). The inclusion of these "sisters" signifies a future reconciliation and restoration, where Israel will be in a position to influence and lead these nations back to righteousness. This reflects the prophetic vision of a restored Israel that becomes a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>).<p><b>I will give them to you as daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates a change in relationship dynamics. In ancient Near Eastern culture, daughters were often seen as part of a family unit under the authority of the head of the household. By giving Samaria and Sodom as "daughters," God is promising a future where these nations will be integrated into a restored community under Israel's leadership. This can be seen as a type of the Church, where all nations are brought together under Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>but not because of My covenant with you</b><br>This statement emphasizes that the restoration and inclusion of these nations are not based on Israel's merit or the original covenant made at Sinai. Instead, it points to God's sovereign grace and mercy. The covenant mentioned here is likely the Mosaic Covenant, which Israel repeatedly broke. The restoration is thus an act of divine grace, foreshadowing the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, where salvation is extended to all people, not based on adherence to the law but through faith (<a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the

recognizing how far she drifted from the covenant love first shown in <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a>.<p>&#8226; This remembering is essential; God often brings His people to repentance by reminding them of former sin (cf. <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Be Ashamed</b><p>&#8220;You will&#8230;be ashamed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Shame is the

destructive. As in <a href="/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>, it produces humility and openness to grace.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s discipline leads to a godly sorrow that &#8220;produces repentance leading to salvation without regret&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When You Receive Your Older and Younger Sisters</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;when you receive your older and younger sisters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier, God named Jerusalem&#8217;s &#8220;older sister&#8221; Samaria and &#8220;younger sister&#8221; Sodom (<a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46-48</a>).<p>&#8226; In the future restoration, these once-judged cities&#8212;representing both apostate Israel and notoriously wicked nations&#8212;will be joined to Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/19-24.htm">Isaiah 19:24-25</a> foreshadows a day when historically hostile peoples stand together under the Lord&#8217;s blessing, illustrating His far-reaching mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I Will Give Them to You as Daughters</b><p>&#8220;I will give them to you as daughters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A daughter sits under the care and protection of her mother.

Israel&#8217;s restored role will be a testimony that salvation is &#8220;not of yourselves; it is the gift of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-61.htm">Ezekiel 16:61</a> looks past judgment to a future in which Jerusalem remembers her sin, feels appropriate shame, and yet is honored as the mother city for formerly estranged peoples. This honor does not arise from her old covenant performance but from God&#8217;s unwavering, grace-filled commitment to His own everlasting covenant plan. The verse assures us that when God restores, He does so completely&#8212;turning disgrace into influence, scattering mercy beyond Israel to the nations, and displaying that every good thing comes from His gracious promise, not from human worthiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(61) <span class= "bld">Give them unto thee for daughters.</span>--The humiliation of Jerusalem must be so complete that she will gladly receive these once-despised enemies to the closest family relationship. We are not here to think of Sodom specifically, but (the concrete passing into the general) of that which Sodom represented, the heathen world at large. This shall be received with Jerusalem to the church of God; "but not by thy covenant." The covenant with Israel, however it may have been preceded by a "preaching of the Gospel" to Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm" title="And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.">Galatians 3:8</a>), was distinctly a covenant of works, under which neither Jew nor Gentile could attain salvation (see Rom. and Gal. throughout). Not, therefore, by this should the nations of the earth be given to Jerusalem as representing the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then thou shalt remember thy ways,</span> etc. The pardon which God gives is not, as men sometimes dream, a water of Lethe, blotting out the memory of the evil past.

The shame which it brings with it is necessary as the safeguard of the new blessedness. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger.</span> It is significant that, as in the Revised Version, both the adjectives are now in the plural.
