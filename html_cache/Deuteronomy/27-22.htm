The curse here is a pronouncement of divine disfavor and judgment upon those who violate this command. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such relationships were considered taboo and were often associated with pagan practices. The law serves to maintain the sanctity and purity of the family unit, which is foundational to Israelite society. This command is reiterated in <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9 and 20</a>:17, emphasizing its importance. The prohibition reflects God's desire for moral purity and the protection of familial relationships. The mention of both "the daughter of his father" and "the daughter of his mother" ensures that all potential incestuous relationships are covered, regardless of whether the siblings share both parents or just one.<p><b>And let all the people say, &#8216;Amen!&#8217;</b><br>The response of "Amen" by the people signifies their agreement and acceptance of the law. It is a communal affirmation of the covenant between God and Israel, indicating that the people collectively endorse the curse and the moral standards it upholds. This practice of communal affirmation is seen throughout <a href="/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>, where the Israelites are called to confirm their commitment to God's laws. The use of "Amen" is a solemn acknowledgment of the truth and seriousness of the command, and it binds the community to uphold these standards. This practice of public affirmation can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on the church as a community of believers who hold each other accountable to God's standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's laws to the people.

A &#8220;curse&#8221; is the opposite of God&#8217;s blessing; it signals separation from His favor (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>).<p>- By placing this statement on Mount Ebal with the other covenant curses (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-13.htm">Deuteronomy 27:13</a>), the Lord publicly binds Israel to uphold His moral law.<p>- The curse is not merely social disapproval&#8212;God Himself enforces it. This underscores His holy character and His right to define right and wrong (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who sleeps with his sister</b><p>- The act described is sexual intercourse with one&#8217;s sister, a clear violation of God&#8217;s created order for family relationships (<a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6&#8211;9</a>; 20:17).<p>- Incest strikes at the heart of family integrity, which is designed to mirror God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25, 32</a>).<p>- Scripture records tragic fallout when this line is crossed, such as Amnon&#8217;s sin against his sister Tamar and its devastating aftermath (<a href="/2_samuel/13-11.htm">2 Samuel 13:11&#8211;15, 28</a>-29).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother</b><p>- This phrase removes any loophole: whether the sister is full, half, or step, the prohibition stands (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a> highlights why this needed to be clarified).<p>- God intends marriage to exist outside the immediate family, preserving genetic health and social stability. Violating that boundary invites judgment (<a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>, &#8220;They shall be cut off in the sight of their people&#8221;).<p>- The family is the fundamental training ground for love, respect, and protection.
