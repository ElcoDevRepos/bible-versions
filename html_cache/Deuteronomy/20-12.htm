In the context of Deuteronomy, God is giving instructions to the Israelites on how to conduct warfare as they enter the Promised Land. The offer of peace reflects God's desire for reconciliation and order, even in times of conflict. This approach is consistent with the broader biblical theme of seeking peace before resorting to war (<a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>, <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). Historically, this reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of offering terms before engaging in battle.<p><b>and wage war against you</b><br>Here, the text acknowledges the reality of conflict when peace is rejected. The Israelites are permitted to defend themselves and engage in warfare if necessary. This reflects the principle of just war, where defense is justified when attacked. Theologically, it underscores the idea that while God desires peace, He also provides for the protection and survival of His people. This can be seen in other biblical narratives where God supports Israel in battle when they are faithful to Him (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8-14</a>).<p><b>lay siege to that city</b><br>The instruction to lay siege indicates a methodical approach to warfare, common in ancient times. A siege involved surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This tactic is seen in other biblical accounts, such as the siege of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the siege of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-3</a>). Archaeological evidence from ancient cities like Lachish and Hazor shows the remnants of siege warfare, including siege ramps and battering rams. Spiritually, this can be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, where believers are called to stand firm against spiritual strongholds (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to conduct warfare as they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_cities.htm">Canaanite Cities</a></b><br>The cities in the Promised Land that the Israelites are commanded to conquer.

The verse now considers the scenario in which that offer is rejected.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law puts the burden on Israel to seek reconciliation first; hostility is never the initial posture. See the earlier pattern with Edom (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>) and the Gibeonites&#8217; proactive treaty in <a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3-15</a>.<p>&#8226; When a city &#8220;refuses,&#8221; it deliberately turns down God&#8217;s gracious provision for survival and coexistence, echoing <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>, which warns of the danger of repeatedly hardening one&#8217;s heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wage war against you</b><p>&#8226; Refusal becomes active aggression.
