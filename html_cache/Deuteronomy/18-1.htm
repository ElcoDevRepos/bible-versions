This separation is rooted in the events of the Golden Calf incident (Exodus 32), where the Levites stood with Moses against idolatry. The Levites were chosen to serve in the tabernacle and later in the temple, performing sacrifices and maintaining the holy place. This role is a type of Christ, who serves as our High Priest, mediating between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel.</b><br>Unlike the other tribes, the Levites did not receive a specific territory in the Promised Land. This lack of land inheritance emphasized their dependence on God and the community of Israel for sustenance. It also highlighted their unique role as spiritual leaders and servants. This arrangement is reminiscent of the New Testament teaching that believers are to store up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>They are to eat the food offerings to the LORD;</b><br>The Levites were provided for through the offerings made by the Israelites. Portions of sacrifices, such as the peace offerings, were designated for the priests (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>). This system ensured that those who served in the temple were sustained by the worship of the people. It reflects the principle that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>that is their inheritance.</b><br>The Levites' inheritance was not material but spiritual and communal. Their portion was the Lord Himself and the service they performed in His name. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), with their inheritance being eternal life and a relationship with God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priests.htm">Levitical Priests</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle and later the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_levi.htm">Tribe of Levi</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, chosen by God for priestly service and religious leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_made_by_fire.htm">Offerings Made by Fire</a></b><br>Sacrifices presented to God, which were a part of the Levitical priests' sustenance and inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of twelve tribes, each with its own inheritance in the Promised Land, except for the tribe of Levi.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The land and possessions allocated to the tribes of Israel, which the Levites did not receive in the same manner as the other tribes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_his_servants.htm">God's Provision for His Servants</a></b><br>The Levites were sustained by the offerings, teaching us that God provides for those who serve Him faithfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_inheritance_over_material_possessions.htm">Spiritual Inheritance Over Material Possessions</a></b><br>The Levites' inheritance was spiritual rather than material, reminding believers to prioritize spiritual blessings over earthly wealth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_priests_in_community.htm">Role of Priests in Community</a></b><br>The Levites served a unique role in Israel, pointing to the importance of spiritual leadership and service within the Christian community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Just as the Levites depended on God for their sustenance, Christians are called to trust in God's provision in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_identity_of_believers.htm">Priestly Identity of Believers</a></b><br>As New Testament believers, we are called to a royal priesthood, serving God and others with our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_18_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 18:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Deut_18_1_show_Levites_reliance.htm">How does Deuteronomy 18:1 emphasize the Levites' dependence on God's provision?

They alone carried the tabernacle, taught the Law, and mediated worship. Unlike the other tribes, they were not warriors staking out territory; they were worship leaders staking out holiness. By naming &#8220;the whole tribe of Levi,&#8221; the text reminds us that every Levite&#8212;from the high priest to the gatekeeper&#8212;was consecrated. <a href="/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a> shows how their zeal for God during the golden-calf crisis led to this unique calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel.</b><p>Land was the primary sign of God&#8217;s covenant blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>). Yet the Lord deliberately withheld territorial allotments from Levi (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a>). Two truths emerge:<p>&#8226; God provides differently for different callings; faithfulness, not uniformity, is His standard.<p>&#8226; Spiritual service sometimes replaces material security, echoing Jesus&#8217; words in <a href="/luke/9-58.htm">Luke 9:58</a> that &#8220;the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.&#8221;<p>By surrendering visible assets, the Levites testified that God Himself is the greatest treasure (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are to eat the food offerings to the LORD;</b><p>Instead of fields and vineyards, the Levites received portions of the sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-11</a>). The same altar that satisfied God&#8217;s holiness also sustained His servants. This arrangement:<p>&#8226; Highlighted the holiness of their diet&#8212;what was set apart for God was now shared with them.<p>&#8226; Kept them near the sanctuary, ensuring continual ministry (<a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Foreshadowed the gospel principle that &#8220;those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that is their inheritance.</b><p>The climax is relational, not nutritional.

Their daily dependence on offerings taught Israel&#8212;and still teaches us&#8212;that intimacy with God outweighs earthly gain. <a href="/hebrews/7-5.htm">Hebrews 7:5</a> notes that Levites received tithes, yet even that points to Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who provides an imperishable inheritance (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a> explains that the Levites were landless by divine design, living instead from the offerings brought to God.

No such idea occurred to Rashi. He says, <span class= "ital">"</span>all the tribe of Levi, not only those that are perfect (who can serve), but those who have a blemish (and cannot)." The distinction between priest and Levite has already been sufficiently noted on <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm" title="And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm" title="And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>.

The "two cheeks and the maw" are not mentioned elsewhere, and the latter word is found in this place only. They are not a valuable part of the sacrifice. An absurd reason for the gift is assigned by Rashi. We know that in the time of Eli, the priests varied their requirements at pleasure, and in the face of the law (see <a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1Samuel 2:13</a>).
