The context is the renewal of the covenant between God and Israel as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. The use of "today" underscores the present reality of God's ongoing relationship with His people. This proclamation is a formal declaration, akin to a royal decree, highlighting the authority and sovereignty of God.<p><b>that you are His people</b><br>This phrase identifies the Israelites as belonging to God, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament. It reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>) and reiterated in various forms throughout the Pentateuch. Being God's people implies a special status and responsibility, setting them apart from other nations. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers in Christ are described as a chosen people (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and treasured possession</b><br>The term "treasured possession" conveys the idea of something highly valued and cherished. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's treasured possession would be his most prized and protected assets. This reflects God's deep love and commitment to Israel. The phrase is also found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a> and <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a>, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenantal promises. It foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as God's treasured possession through Christ (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<p><b>as He promised</b><br>This phrase points to the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises. The promise of Israel being God's people and treasured possession was first made to the patriarchs, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a>). It highlights the reliability of God's word and His unchanging nature. This assurance of God's promises is a recurring theme in Scripture, providing hope and confidence to His people.<p><b>that you are to keep all His commandments</b><br>This phrase underscores the conditional aspect of the covenant relationship. While God's love and choice of Israel are unconditional, their enjoyment of the blessings associated with being His people requires obedience. The commandments given at Sinai and throughout the Torah are the means by which Israel is to live out their identity as God's people. This call to obedience is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping His commandments as a demonstration of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who has chosen Israel as His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being addressed in this passage as His treasured possession.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is delivering God's message to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land that God has promised to the Israelites, which they are about to enter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, where God promises blessings in return for obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_treasured_possession.htm">God's Treasured Possession</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to see ourselves as God's treasured possession, which should influence our identity and self-worth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commandments.htm">Obedience to God's Commandments</a></b><br>The call to keep God's commandments is timeless.
