In ancient Israel, marriage was a covenantal relationship, and adultery was seen as a severe breach of this covenant. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on family integrity and lineage, and adultery threatened both. The phrase "found lying" implies the act was discovered, suggesting the need for witnesses or evidence, aligning with the legal standards of the time (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>both the man who slept with her and the woman must die</b><br>The prescribed punishment for adultery was death, reflecting the gravity of the sin in the eyes of the community and God. This severe penalty underscores the importance of marital fidelity and the sanctity of marriage. The equal punishment for both parties involved highlights the shared responsibility and culpability in the act. This law served as a deterrent and was intended to maintain moral order within the community. The New Testament account of the woman caught in adultery (<a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3-11</a>) shows Jesus' response to such situations, emphasizing mercy and repentance.<p><b>You must purge the evil from Israel</b><br>This command reflects the need to maintain holiness and purity within the community of Israel. The phrase "purge the evil" indicates that sin was not just a personal failing but a communal concern that could affect the entire nation. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where the church is called to maintain purity and discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-13</a>). The idea of purging evil is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate purification and redemption through Jesus Christ, who bore the penalty for sin and offers forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>Refers to any male individual who engages in adultery with a married woman.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/married_woman.htm">Married Woman</a></b><br>A woman who is legally bound in marriage to another man, involved in the act of adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who are given laws to maintain holiness and purity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adultery.htm">Adultery</a></b><br>The act of a married person engaging in sexual relations with someone other than their spouse, considered a grave sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/purge_the_evil.htm">Purge the Evil</a></b><br>The act of removing sin and its consequences from the community to maintain holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Adultery is not just a personal failing but a community concern that affects the holiness of God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>God's laws are designed to maintain the purity of His people, calling them to live distinct and holy lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has serious consequences, both spiritually and communally, and must be addressed to prevent further corruption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_justice_and_mercy.htm">The Role of Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>While the law demands justice, the New Testament reveals the importance of mercy and forgiveness through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>Believers are called to guard their hearts and minds against lust and temptation, recognizing the broader implications of sin.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_22_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 22:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_22_22_s_take_on_marital_fidelity_now.htm">How does Deuteronomy 22:22 emphasize the importance of marital fidelity today?

Notice:<p>&#8226; The sin is discovered, not merely suspected, underscoring that God&#8217;s justice operates on known facts (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Adultery betrays the one-flesh bond, striking at the very picture of God&#8217;s covenant love (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently condemns this act: &#8220;You shall not commit adultery&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>), and &#8220;Marriage should be honored by all&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus deepens the principle to the heart level: looking with lust is adultery in seed form (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>).<p>The clause therefore highlights how seriously God regards marital faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>both the man who slept with her and the woman must die</b><p>The sentence continues: &#8220;both the man who slept with her and the woman must die&#8221;.

Compare <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>, which mirrors this balanced justice.<p>&#8226; Capital punishment under the Mosaic covenant reflected the covenant community&#8217;s theocratic structure; sin against marriage was sin against God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The severity teaches that sin&#8217;s wages are death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). While today Christ has borne the penalty for believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>), the underlying truth about sin&#8217;s deadly cost remains.<p>&#8226; Even King David&#8217;s adultery with Bathsheba drew divine judgment, though he found mercy through repentance (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>). God&#8217;s grace never trivializes the sin.<p>This clause underscores that God treats marital unfaithfulness as a capital offense because it assaults His design and His people&#8217;s well-being.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must purge the evil from Israel</b><p>Finally, &#8220;You must purge the evil from Israel&#8221;. Here the focus shifts from the individuals to the community:<p>&#8226; Sin tolerated becomes contagion; like leaven, it spreads (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Purging guards the nation&#8217;s spiritual health so God may dwell among them (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeated in other contexts&#8212;false prophecy (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>), rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-21.htm">Deuteronomy 21:21</a>)&#8212;the phrase calls Israel to covenant vigilance.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, church discipline echoes this principle, aiming to restore the sinner and protect the body (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people today still pursue holiness, though through repentance and restoration rather than civil execution, because Christ fulfills the law&#8217;s ultimate demand (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>).<p>The clause drives home communal responsibility: holiness is never a private matter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a> affirms God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to marital faithfulness, equal accountability, and the purity of His covenant community. While the civil penalty was unique to Israel&#8217;s theocracy, the moral weight endures: adultery destroys, sin demands death, and God calls His people to guard holiness. Christ&#8217;s atoning work satisfies the penalty, empowering believers to honor marriage and purge sin through confession, forgiveness, and restored obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-29.</span> - Four cases are here distinguished. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That of a married woman who has been unfaithful;
