Falling down before the LORD is a physical expression of submission and supplication, often seen in biblical narratives when individuals seek God's mercy or intervention. This act is reminiscent of other biblical figures who prostrated themselves before God, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>).<p><b>for forty days and forty nights</b><br>The period of forty days and nights is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing a time of testing, trial, or preparation. This duration is seen in the story of Noah's flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Moses' time on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), and Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). It underscores the seriousness and intensity of Moses' intercession for the Israelites.<p><b>as I had done the first time</b><br>This refers back to Moses' initial intercession on behalf of the Israelites after the sin of the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-32</a>). It highlights Moses' role as a mediator between God and His people, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>I did not eat bread or drink water</b><br>Moses' fasting is an extreme form of self-denial, emphasizing the gravity of the situation and his total dependence on God. Fasting is a common biblical practice for seeking God's guidance or favor, as seen in the lives of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>) and Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p><b>because of all the sin you had committed</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the collective sin of the Israelites, specifically their idolatry and rebellion against God. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine displeasure and the need for repentance (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>The concept of evil in the sight of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. It underscores the holiness of God and the expectation of His people to live according to His statutes (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>and provoking Him to anger</b><br>Provoking God to anger is a serious offense, indicating a breach of the covenant and a failure to honor God as sovereign. This phrase is a reminder of God's righteous anger against sin, yet also His willingness to forgive upon genuine repentance, as seen in the story of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who intercedes on their behalf, demonstrating his role as a mediator between God and His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and merciful, and who communicates His will to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who have sinned and are at risk of destruction due to their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses receives the Law and where he intercedes for the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_calf_incident.htm">The Golden Calf Incident</a></b><br>The event that prompted Moses' intercession, where the Israelites worshiped an idol, breaking their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercession.htm">The Power of Intercession</a></b><br>Moses' intercession demonstrates the power and importance of standing in the gap for others in prayer.

He now spent forty days and nights in the work of intercession. We are not to understand that the first forty were so spent. At that time he received the pattern of the tabernacle and the directions for the priesthood, which he did not deliver to Israel until after he descended from Sinai the second time. (See <a href="/context/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18-18</a>, and <a href="/exodus/35-1.htm" title="And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD has commanded, that you should do them.">Exodus 35:1</a>. &c.) During the first forty days, Joshua was with Moses in the mount (probably to help in taking the pattern for the tabernacle); during the second forty Moses was alone.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - Moses interceded with God for the people before he came down from the mount (<a href="/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>, etc.); but this he passes over here, merely referring to it in the words, "as at the first," and makes special mention only of a subsequent intercession, that mentioned in <a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>. In the account in Exodus nothing is said of Moses interceding for Aaron specially, as well as for the people generally; but prominence is given to this here, "not only that he might make the people thoroughly aware that at that time Israel could not boast even of the righteousness of its eminent men (cf. <a href="/isaiah/43-27.htm">Isaiah 43:27</a>), but also to bring out the fact, which is described still more fully in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>., that Aaron's investiture with the priesthood and the maintenance of this institution was purely a work of Divine grace" (Keil).
