Unlike other tribes, they did not receive a specific territory in the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Instead, they were distributed among the other tribes and relied on the tithes and offerings of the people for their sustenance. This command emphasizes the importance of community responsibility and care for those who serve in spiritual roles. The phrase "within your gates" indicates that the Levites lived among the people, serving in local communities rather than being isolated in a single location. This arrangement allowed them to minister effectively and maintain the spiritual health of the nation.<p><b>since he has no portion or inheritance among you</b><br>The Levites' lack of a territorial inheritance underscores their unique role and dependence on God and the community for provision. This arrangement is a reminder of their dedication to spiritual service rather than material wealth. It also highlights the principle of reliance on God, as seen in the New Testament with Jesus' teaching on not storing up treasures on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The Levites' situation foreshadows the New Testament concept of the priesthood of all believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), where spiritual service and reliance on God are central themes. This phrase also serves as a call to the Israelites to remember their covenant responsibilities and to support those who dedicate their lives to God's work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle and later the Temple.

God calls His people to intentional generosity, not accidental stinginess. He repeats this idea in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11-13</a>, where Israel is told to rejoice and then bring the tithe &#8220;so that the Levites may eat.&#8221; <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> echoes the principle: &#8220;Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due.&#8221; By framing it as &#8220;do not neglect,&#8221; the Lord removes any excuse. Care for His servants is never optional; it is covenant duty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Levite</b><p>Levites were set apart for temple service (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). They taught the Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>) and led worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16-24</a>). New Testament parallels appear in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul notes that those who preach the gospel should &#8220;receive their living from the gospel.&#8221; The office may differ, but the underlying truth remains: those who minister full-time depend on God&#8217;s people for daily provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>within your gates</b><p>&#8220;Your gates&#8221; points to local responsibility. Each town was to notice the Levites living among them (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>). Generosity starts at home, long before it reaches distant needs. In <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-37</a>, early believers laid money at the apostles&#8217; feet so &#8220;there were no needy persons among them.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a> urges doing good &#8220;especially to the household of faith.&#8221; Biblical charity is personal, proximate, and practical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since he has no portion or inheritance among you</b><p>Unlike the other tribes, Levites received no farmland (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Their inheritance was the Lord Himself and the offerings His people brought. This arrangement underscored dependence on God and unity among the tribes: everyone had a stake in the nation&#8217;s worship. Today, churches mirror the pattern when budgets allocate for pastors, missionaries, and benevolence, trusting <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a> that God &#8220;will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a> commands Israel&#8212;and by extension believers today&#8212;to provide tangible support for those devoted to God&#8217;s service. Neglect is disobedience; generosity is worship.
