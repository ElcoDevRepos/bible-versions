The act of writing by God Himself signifies the sacredness and permanence of His commandments. This mirrors the initial giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, where God inscribed the Ten Commandments with His own finger (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>).<p><b>the words that were on the first tablets,</b><br>The reference to the "first tablets" recalls the original set of tablets given to Moses, which contained the Ten Commandments. These commandments are foundational to the covenant between God and Israel, representing God's moral and ethical standards. The repetition of the same words underscores the unchanging nature of God's Law, despite human failure.<p><b>which you broke;</b><br>This phrase refers to the incident in <a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>, where Moses broke the first tablets in anger upon witnessing the Israelites worshiping the golden calf. This act symbolizes the breaking of the covenant by the people through idolatry. It serves as a reminder of human sinfulness and the need for repentance and restoration.<p><b>and you are to place them in the ark.&#8221;</b><br>The ark mentioned here is the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred chest that held the tablets of the Law. The placement of the tablets in the ark signifies the centrality of God's Law in the life of Israel. The ark itself is a type of Christ, representing God's presence among His people and foreshadowing the New Covenant through Jesus, who perfectly fulfilled the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).

The mistake arises from the change of person in <a href="/exodus/34-28.htm" title="And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.">Exodus 34:28</a>, where the same pronoun "he" refers first to Moses, and then to Jehovah. But there is no doubt as to the fact or its spiritual meaning. The tables of stone represent the "fleshy tables of the heart" as St. Paul teaches us in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2Corinthians 3:3</a>. The first pair of tables were like the heart of Adam, which came fresh from the hand of his Maker, with the word of the Law written on them. But this perished by the fall, beneath the mountain of the Law. The humanity which ascended to receive the Spirit for us was prepared by the Mediator on earth. The "second man" receive "the new covenant," "not the letter, but the Spirit," which puts God's laws in men's minds, and writes them in their hearts, making them God's temple. Thus the ark and the tabernacle which received the Law are a figure of God's human temple, and of the renewed heart of man.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will write</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7733;&#183;t&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
