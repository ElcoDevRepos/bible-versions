The concept of God being "jealous" is rooted in His covenant relationship with Israel, akin to a marriage where fidelity is expected. In <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, God describes Himself as a "jealous God," emphasizing His desire for exclusive worship. The "foreign gods" refer to the deities of surrounding nations, such as Baal and Asherah, which Israel was warned against in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>. This idolatry often led to syncretism, where Israel mixed the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Archaeological findings, such as altars and idols, corroborate the prevalence of such practices in ancient Israel.<p><b>they enraged Him with abominations.</b><br>The term "abominations" often refers to practices detestable to God, including idolatry, child sacrifice, and sexual immorality, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18 and 20</a>. These actions were not only religiously offensive but also morally corrupt, leading to societal decay. The "rage" of God is a response to the breach of covenant, reflecting His holiness and justice. This anger is not capricious but is a righteous response to sin, as seen in the prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/25-6.htm">Jeremiah 25:6-7</a>). The abominations committed by Israel are contrasted with the holiness required by God, pointing to the need for repentance and foreshadowing the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers redemption from sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering a song to the Israelites as a reminder of God's faithfulness and a warning against idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being warned against turning to foreign gods and abandoning their covenant with Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>The idols and deities of surrounding nations that the Israelites were tempted to worship, leading them away from the true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/yahweh.htm">Yahweh</a></b><br>The one true God, who is provoked to jealousy by the Israelites' idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where the Israelites are headed, and where they will face the temptation to adopt the practices of the nations around them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can include anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.
