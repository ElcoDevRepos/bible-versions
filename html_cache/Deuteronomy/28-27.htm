The "boils of Egypt" specifically recall the sixth plague, where painful sores broke out on the Egyptians. This serves as a warning to the Israelites that disobedience to God's covenant will result in similar judgments. The mention of Egypt is significant, as it reminds the Israelites of their past bondage and the power of God to deliver and to judge. It underscores the seriousness of covenant faithfulness and the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>with tumors and scabs and itch</b><br>These ailments are indicative of severe skin diseases, which in the ancient Near Eastern context, were often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment. The specific mention of "tumors" may also connect to the afflictions suffered by the Philistines when they captured the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6-12</a>). Skin diseases in biblical times were not only physically painful but also socially isolating, as they could render a person ceremonially unclean (Leviticus 13-14). This highlights the comprehensive nature of the curses for disobedience, affecting both physical health and social standing.<p><b>from which you cannot be cured</b><br>The incurability of these afflictions emphasizes the severity of the judgment. In the biblical worldview, true healing comes from God, and the inability to be cured signifies a withdrawal of divine favor and blessing. This phrase underscores the hopelessness and desperation that result from turning away from God's commands. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of obedience and the dire consequences of forsaking the covenant. Theologically, it points to the need for divine intervention and the ultimate healing that comes through faithfulness to God, foreshadowing the complete healing and restoration found in Jesus Christ (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both the giver of blessings and the enforcer of curses based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving the blessings and curses as part of the covenant established at Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A place of past bondage for Israel, symbolizing oppression and divine judgment, referenced here to remind Israel of the plagues they witnessed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/boils,_tumors,_rash,_scabies.htm">Boils, Tumors, Rash, Scabies</a></b><br>Specific afflictions mentioned as part of the curses for disobedience, reminiscent of the plagues that struck Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_at_mount_sinai.htm">Covenant at Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The event where God gave the Law to Israel, establishing the terms of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's covenant with Israel included both blessings and curses.
