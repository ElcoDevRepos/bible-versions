Fortified cities with high walls were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures as a means of defense against invaders. The presence of such fortifications indicates the strength and advanced state of the societies that inhabited these areas. This detail underscores the miraculous nature of Israel's victories, as they were able to conquer well-defended cities despite being a nomadic people without a standing army. The high walls symbolize human strength and security, which are ultimately overcome by God's power, as seen in the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6).<p><b>and gates and bars</b><br>Gates and bars were essential components of ancient city defenses, controlling access and providing security. The mention of these features highlights the completeness of the fortifications, suggesting that these cities were well-prepared for siege warfare. In biblical symbolism, gates often represent authority and power, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>, where Jesus speaks of the "gates of Hades." The overcoming of these gates by the Israelites can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over the powers of darkness.<p><b>and there were many more unwalled villages</b><br>The unwalled villages contrast with the fortified cities, indicating a diversity of settlement types within the region. These villages were likely more vulnerable to attack and less politically significant than the fortified cities. The mention of unwalled villages suggests the comprehensive nature of Israel's conquest, as they did not only target major urban centers but also smaller, less defended communities. This detail reflects the thoroughness of God's judgment on the Canaanite nations, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, and the fulfillment of His promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is recounting their journey and victories as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are on the brink of entering the land promised to them by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>The Amorite king defeated by the Israelites, whose territory included the fortified cities mentioned in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile land and strong cities, which was conquered by the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortified_cities.htm">Fortified Cities</a></b><br>These cities represent the strength and security of the enemy, yet they were overcome by the Israelites through God's power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The fortified cities symbolize human strength and security, yet they fall before God's will.

Moses notes, &#8220;All these cities&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;every urban center in Bashan, not a mere handful. This stresses the totality of God&#8217;s victory. &#8226; <a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4&#8211;6</a> lists sixty such towns, underscoring completeness. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a> reminds us that it was not Israel&#8217;s sword but God&#8217;s favor that won the land. The phrase prompts worship: if He conquered &#8220;all,&#8221; nothing in our lives is beyond His reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were fortified</b><p>These places were not pushovers; they &#8220;were fortified,&#8221; meaning strongholds prepared for siege. &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a> echoes Israel&#8217;s earlier fear of &#8220;fortified cities,&#8221; yet God overcame what once intimidated them. &#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a> speaks of divine power to demolish strongholds today&#8212;whether physical or spiritual. God&#8217;s people learn that no human defense outmatches His might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with high walls</b><p>Walls symbolize separation and security. High ones imply invincibility by human standards, but God leveled them. &#8226; Jericho&#8217;s walls in <a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a> collapse at His command. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>: &#8220;With my God I can scale a wall.&#8221; The text invites trust: no obstacle is too high for the Lord who shepherds His flock.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gates</b><p>Gates controlled access; shut tight, they projected permanence. Yet <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a> predicts God breaking &#8220;bronze gates.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a> celebrates Christ who &#8220;opens and no one will shut.&#8221; The mention of gates reminds believers that every entry point of blessing or opposition is ultimately in God&#8217;s hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bars</b><p>Bars were the heavy beams locking those gates. Even these failed. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/147-13.htm">Psalm 147:13</a> praises Him who &#8220;strengthens the bars of your gates,&#8221; showing He can just as easily weaken them for His purposes.

The detail shows that His deliverance is comprehensive, from the large fortified hub to the smallest open village.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a> showcases the total, barrier-breaking power of God. Every level of human defense&#8212;city, wall, gate, bar&#8212;falls before Him, and His victory extends even to the smallest village. The verse reassures believers that no opponent is too strong, no situation too complex, and no community too small for the Lord who conquers on behalf of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these cities</span> were <span class="cmt_word">fenced with high walls, gates, and bars</span>; literally, <span class="accented">double gates and a bar</span>. These cities, with their marvelous erections, are believed to be still existing in the Hauran. Over that district tire strewn a multitude of towns of various sizes, all constructed after the same remarkable fashion. "The streets are perfect, the walls perfect, and, what seems more astonish. tug, the stone doors are still hanging on their hinges, so little impression has been made during these many centuries on the hard and durable stone of which they are built" (Graham, <span class="accented">Cambridge Essays</span>, p. 160). These doors are "formed of slabs of stone, opening on pivots which are projecting parts of the stone itself, and working in sockets in the lintel and threshold." Some of these gates are large enough to admit of a camel passing through them, and the doors are of proportionate dimensions, some of the stones of which they are formed being eighteen inches in thickness. The roofs also are formed of huge stone slabs resting on the massive walls. All betoken the workmanship of a race endowed with powers far exceeding those of ordinary men; and give credibility to the supposition that we have in them the dwellings of the giant race that occupied that district before it was invaded by the Israelites. "We could not help," says Mr. Graham, "being impressed with the belief that had we never known anything of the early portion of Scripture history before visiting this country, we should have been forced to the conclusion that its original inhabitants, the people who had constructed those cities, were not only a powerful and mighty nation, but individuals of greater strength than ourselves."
