The "fat" of the sacrifices was considered the best part and was often reserved for the deity being worshiped. In the context of Deuteronomy, this highlights the futility of idol worship, as these gods are depicted as consuming the offerings but providing no real benefit or power. This contrasts with the God of Israel, who is described as the living God who actively participates in the lives of His people (see <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>).<p><b>and drank the wine of their drink offerings?</b><br>Drink offerings were libations poured out to deities as part of worship rituals. The mention of wine here emphasizes the richness and value of what was offered to these idols. In biblical times, wine was a symbol of joy and abundance, yet here it is wasted on lifeless idols. This critique of idol worship is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the absurdity of creating and worshiping idols.<p><b>Let them rise up and help you;</b><br>This is a rhetorical challenge, highlighting the impotence of idols. The call for these gods to "rise up" is ironic, as they have no power to act or intervene. This is reminiscent of Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>, where he mocks their god's inability to respond. The phrase underscores the biblical theme that only the God of Israel is living and active, capable of delivering and helping His people.<p><b>let them give you shelter!</b><br>The concept of "shelter" here implies protection and refuge, which are attributes often ascribed to God in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>). The irony is that these idols, which are inanimate and powerless, cannot provide the security and protection that the true God offers. This serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to be their protector and refuge (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Moses is delivering a song to the Israelites as a final message before his death.
