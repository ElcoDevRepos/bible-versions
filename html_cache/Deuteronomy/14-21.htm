Eating a carcass, an animal that died of itself, was considered unclean (<a href="/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39-40</a>). This law served to distinguish Israel from surrounding nations and to prevent the spread of disease. It also symbolized spiritual cleanliness, as God's people were to be set apart in all aspects of life.<p><b>you may give it to the foreigner residing within your gates, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner.</b><br>Foreigners, or "sojourners," were not bound by the same dietary laws as Israelites. This provision shows a practical approach to the law, allowing for economic benefit and hospitality without compromising Israelite holiness. It highlights the distinction between the covenant people and others, while still showing kindness and provision for those living among them.<p><b>For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God.</b><br>This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Holiness, or being set apart, is a central theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Israel's identity as God's chosen people required them to live according to His statutes, reflecting His character to the nations. This holiness is a precursor to the New Testament call for believers to be holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>You must not cook a young goat in its mother&#8217;s milk.</b><br>This prohibition is repeated in <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19 and 34</a>:26. It likely addresses a pagan Canaanite ritual, thus preventing Israel from adopting idolatrous practices. The command also reflects a broader principle of compassion and respect for life, avoiding cruelty. Some see a typological connection to Christ, who fulfills the law and embodies perfect compassion and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and commandments were given.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites residing among the Israelites, who were subject to different regulations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who delivered God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who set apart the Israelites as His holy people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where these laws were to be observed, as the Israelites were preparing to enter it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinctiveness.htm">Holiness and Distinctiveness</a></b><br>The Israelites were called to be a holy people, set apart for God.

God prohibits His people from eating animals that die on their own, even while allowing them to trade such meat to outsiders. The difference is not in the meat but in the people: &#8220;you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God.&#8221; The separate ban on boiling a kid in its mother&#8217;s milk underscores the call to reject pagan practices and honor life as God created it. Obedience in the small, routine act of eating becomes a living witness that the LORD alone defines holiness&#8212;and His people gladly submit to His wise, good boundaries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">That he may eat it.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and he will eat it. </span>The common practice, and not the intention of the writer, may be indicated.
