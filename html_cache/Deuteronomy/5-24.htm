It highlights the communal response of the people, emphasizing their collective experience and acknowledgment of God's presence.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness</b><br>The Israelites recognize the manifestation of God's divine presence. "Glory" and "greatness" refer to God's majestic and overwhelming power, as seen in the fire and smoke on the mountain. This echoes the earlier revelation of God's glory in <a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>, where the appearance of the LORD was like a consuming fire.<p><b>and we have heard His voice out of the fire.</b><br>Hearing God's voice directly was a unique and terrifying experience for the Israelites. The fire symbolizes God's holiness and purity, as well as His unapproachable nature. This event is a direct encounter with the divine, reminiscent of Moses' experience with the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-4</a>.<p><b>Today we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him.</b><br>This statement reflects the Israelites' astonishment and relief that they survived hearing God's voice, which they feared would be fatal. It underscores the mercy of God, who allows His people to live despite their sinful nature. This moment foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, who bridges the gap between God and humanity, allowing for direct communication without fear of death (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are receiving the Law from God through Moses.
