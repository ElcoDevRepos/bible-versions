Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah, but he lost his birthright due to an indiscretion with his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22, 49</a>:3-4). Despite this, Moses prays for the survival and continuation of Reuben's lineage. The blessing reflects a desire for the tribe's preservation and vitality, countering Jacob's earlier words that Reuben would not excel. Historically, the tribe of Reuben settled east of the Jordan River, an area prone to conflicts and invasions, which may have threatened their survival. This blessing can be seen as a plea for divine protection and favor.<p><b>nor his men be few.</b><br>This part of the blessing emphasizes the hope for the tribe's growth and strength in numbers. In ancient Israelite culture, a tribe's power and influence were often measured by its population and military capability. The concern for Reuben's numbers may reflect historical realities, as the tribe was one of the smaller and less prominent among the Israelites. The phrase suggests a reversal of potential decline, ensuring that Reuben's descendants would not diminish. This blessing aligns with God's promises to the patriarchs about multiplying their descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). It also underscores the importance of community and continuity within the covenant people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah, Reuben is the ancestor of the tribe of Reuben.

That his misdeed should not be remembered (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel dwelled in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:">Genesis 35:22</a>). Rashi also notices the juxtaposition of this record with the sentence, "the sons of Jacob were <span class= "ital">twelve." </span>Reuben was not cut off, but he was disinherited (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm" title="Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.">1Chronicles 5:1</a>), and his father's blessing had so much in it of disapproval, that Moses' prayer for him was not unnecessary.<p><span class= "bld">And let not his men be few.</span>--The sentence is difficult. The LXX. insert Simeon, "let Simeon be many in number." But there is no need for this. The most terrible destruction ever wrought in Israel by the word of Moses came on Dathan and Abiram (who were Reubenites), when "they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit." We cannot say how far the tribe was diminished by this terrible visitation and the plague that followed (<span class= "ital">Numbers 16</span>), but the fighting men of the tribe had slightly decreased in the second census (<a href="/numbers/1-21.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-7.htm" title="These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty.">Numbers 26:7</a>), and only two of all the twelve tribes had a smaller force than Reuben<p>at this time. It seems best, therefore, to take the whole verse as applying to Reuben, and the negative in the first clause as covering the second clause also. "Let not his men be a (small) number." The omission of Simeon may be accounted for by his coming <span class= "ital">within the inheritance of Judah, </span>in Canaan, and enjoying the blessing and protection of that most distinguished tribe. Rashi also takes this view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-25.</span> <span class="accented">- Blessings on the tribes individually</span>. With these may be compared the blessing which Jacob pronounced on his sons as representing the tribes of which they were the heads. The two resemble each other in many points; the differences are such as naturally arose from the different relations of the speakers to the objects of their address, and the changes in the condition and prospects of the tribes which during the lapse of centuries had come to pass. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let not his men be few.</span> The negative, though not expressed in the Hebrew, is to be carried into this clause from the preceding. Though the rights of primogeniture had been withdrawn from Reuben, and Jacob had declared that he should not excel, Moses here assures the tribe of continuance, and even prosperity. Their number was not to be small; which was, perhaps, said to comfort them, in view of the fact that their numbers had greatly diminished in the course of their wanderings in the desert (comp. <a href="/numbers/1-21.htm">Numbers 1:21</a> with Numbers 26:7). At no time, however, was this tribe numerous as compared with the others; nor was it ever distinguished either by the enterprise of its members or by the eminence of any of them in the councils of the nation or the management of affairs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let Reuben</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7205.htm">Strong's 7205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Reuben -- 'behold a son!' oldest son of Jacob, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">live</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2421.htm">Strong's 2421: </a> </span><span class="str2">To live, to revive</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">die,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1425;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">nor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4962.htm">Strong's 4962: </a> </span><span class="str2">An adult, a man</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be few.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mis&#183;p&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4557.htm">Strong's 4557: </a> </span><span class="str2">A number, definite, indefinite, narration</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 33:6 Let Reuben live and not die (Deut.
