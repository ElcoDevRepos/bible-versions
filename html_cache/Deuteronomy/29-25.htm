It suggests a communal understanding and acknowledgment of the reasons behind their circumstances. This reflects the collective nature of Israel's covenant relationship with God, where the actions of the community as a whole impact their standing with Him. The communal aspect is seen throughout the Old Testament, where the fate of the nation often hinges on the collective obedience or disobedience of its people.<p><b>&#8216;It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD</b><br>The covenant referred to here is the Mosaic Covenant, established at Mount Sinai. This covenant was a binding agreement between God and Israel, where God promised to be their God and they promised to be His people, following His laws and commandments. Abandoning this covenant implies a serious breach of faith and disobedience, which is a recurring theme in the history of Israel. The consequences of breaking the covenant are outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience are detailed.<p><b>the God of their fathers</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of God's relationship with Israel, tracing back to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the faithfulness of God across generations, despite the unfaithfulness of the people. This continuity is a central theme in the Old Testament, where God is often referred to as the God of the patriarchs, highlighting His enduring covenant promises.<p><b>which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This refers to the historical event of the Exodus, a foundational moment in Israel's history. The Exodus is not only a physical deliverance from slavery but also a spiritual and covenantal act where God establishes Israel as His chosen people. The covenant made at Sinai is directly linked to this act of deliverance, serving as a reminder of God's power and faithfulness. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Bible as a symbol of salvation and redemption, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God of Israel, who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and established a covenant with them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were brought out of Egypt and entered into a covenant with the LORD at Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The solemn agreement between God and the Israelites, which included laws, blessings, and curses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered by God's mighty hand.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who mediated the covenant between God and the Israelites and delivered God's laws to them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_covenant_faithfulness.htm">The Seriousness of Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>The covenant with God is not a casual agreement but a binding relationship that requires faithfulness and obedience.
