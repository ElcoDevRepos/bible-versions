The Israelites' slavery in Egypt is documented in the book of Exodus, where they endured harsh conditions under Pharaoh's rule. This historical context emphasizes God's deliverance and the transformation from slavery to freedom. The memory of their past servitude is intended to foster humility and compassion, encouraging them to treat others, especially the poor and enslaved, with justice and mercy. This remembrance is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, reinforcing the importance of gratitude and obedience to God.<p><b>and the LORD your God redeemed you</b><br>The term "redeemed" signifies a powerful act of liberation and salvation by God. In the biblical context, redemption often involves a cost or sacrifice, pointing to God's intervention in freeing the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This act of redemption is a foreshadowing of the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promise to redeem His people. The concept of redemption is central to the Christian faith, symbolizing deliverance from sin and spiritual death.<p><b>that is why I am giving you this command today</b><br>The command referred to here is part of the broader covenantal laws given to the Israelites. These laws are not arbitrary but are grounded in the historical and theological reality of God's redemptive acts. The commands are meant to shape a community that reflects God's character and justice. This phrase underscores the connection between divine deliverance and ethical living, suggesting that the Israelites' obedience to God's laws is a response to His grace and mercy. The "today" emphasizes the immediacy and relevance of God's commands, urging the Israelites to live in accordance with His will in their present circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were once enslaved in Egypt and later redeemed by God's mighty hand.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were held in bondage for 400 years before God delivered them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel who redeemed His people from slavery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who delivered God's laws and commands to the Israelites, including this reminder in Deuteronomy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>The act of God delivering the Israelites from slavery, symbolizing spiritual redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Remembering past deliverance strengthens faith and gratitude.<br><br>Reflect on personal "Egypts" from which God has delivered you.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_command_and_our_response.htm">God's Command and Our Response</a></b><br>God's commands are rooted in His past actions and character.<br><br>Obedience is a response to God's redemptive work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_redemption.htm">Spiritual Redemption</a></b><br>Just as God redeemed Israel, He offers spiritual redemption through Christ.<br><br>Embrace and live out the freedom found in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_and_generosity.htm">Gratitude and Generosity</a></b><br>Remembering God's deliverance should lead to a life of gratitude and generosity.<br><br>Consider how you can extend grace and freedom to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity is shaped by God's redemptive work, not our past bondage.<br><br>Live as those who are free, serving God and others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_15_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 15:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_15_15_Remember_God_s_deliverance.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:15 emphasize remembering God's deliverance in daily life?
