This role was part of the kinship-based justice system, where family members were responsible for avenging wrongs done to their kin. The concept of the avenger of blood is rooted in the principle of lex talionis, or the law of retaliation, which is also seen in <a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>. The avenger's pursuit in a "rage" underscores the emotional and personal nature of justice in this context, contrasting with the more impersonal legal systems of today.<p><b>overtake him if the distance is great</b><br>The cities of refuge were strategically located throughout Israel to ensure accessibility. <a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6-15</a> and <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7-9</a> detail the establishment of these cities. The phrase "if the distance is great" highlights the importance of these cities being within reach to prevent the avenger from catching the manslayer before he could reach safety. This reflects God's provision for justice tempered with mercy, ensuring that the manslayer had a fair chance to explain his actions.<p><b>and strike him dead though he did not deserve to die</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the distinction between murder and manslaughter. The manslayer did not "deserve to die" because the act was unintentional, lacking premeditation or malice. This distinction is crucial in biblical law, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12-14</a>, which differentiates between intentional and accidental killings. The provision for cities of refuge illustrates God's justice, which considers intent and circumstances, not just actions.<p><b>since he did not intend any harm</b><br>The lack of intent is a key factor in determining the manslayer's innocence. This reflects the biblical principle that God judges the heart and intentions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. The provision for unintentional killers to find refuge foreshadows the grace found in Christ, who provides refuge and forgiveness for those who repent, regardless of their past actions. This concept of refuge and grace is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>, where believers are encouraged to "take hold of the hope set before us."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manslayer.htm">Manslayer</a></b><br>An individual who has unintentionally caused the death of another person.
