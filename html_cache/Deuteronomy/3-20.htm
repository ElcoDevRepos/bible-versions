The "rest" refers to the cessation of warfare and the establishment of peace and security in the Promised Land. This promise of rest is first seen in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, where God rests on the seventh day, setting a pattern for His people. The Israelites' rest is contingent upon God's provision and their obedience. The idea of rest is further developed in the New Testament, where it is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers spiritual rest to believers (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>and they too have taken possession of the land</b><br>The possession of the land is a central theme in Deuteronomy and the Pentateuch. It signifies the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The land is not just a physical territory but a place where God's people can live under His rule and blessing. The act of taking possession involves both divine intervention and human responsibility. The Israelites are called to trust in God's promises and act in faith, as seen in the conquest narratives in the Book of Joshua.<p><b>that the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan.</b><br>The Jordan River serves as a significant geographical and symbolic boundary. Crossing the Jordan represents a transition from the wilderness wanderings to the inheritance of the Promised Land. This crossing is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the fulfillment of God's promises and the beginning of a new chapter. The phrase underscores God's active role in giving the land, emphasizing His sovereignty and faithfulness. The crossing of the Jordan is also a type of baptism, symbolizing death to the old life and entry into a new life, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>).<p><b>Then each of you may return to the possession I have given you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a return to individual inheritance after the collective mission is accomplished. It reflects the tribal allotments described in the Book of Joshua, where each tribe receives a specific portion of the land. The return to one's possession signifies the completion of God's promise and the establishment of a settled life in the land. This concept of inheritance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ, receiving an eternal inheritance (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>). The phrase also highlights the importance of community and mutual support among God's people, as they are called to ensure that all tribes receive their inheritance before returning to their own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is recounting God's commands and promises to the people before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are preparing to enter the Promised Land after their exodus from Egypt and years of wandering in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land across the Jordan River that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary that the Israelites must cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel who promises rest and possession of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_shared_responsibility.htm">Unity and Shared Responsibility</a></b><br>The Israelites were to support one another until all had received their inheritance.
