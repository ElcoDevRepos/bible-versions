The promise of love, blessing, and multiplication echoes the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>), where God promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. The multiplication of the people is a sign of divine favor and fulfillment of God's promises. This reflects the cultural importance of family and progeny in ancient Israel, where large families were seen as a blessing and a sign of God's favor.<p><b>He will bless the fruit of your womb and the produce of your land&#8212;your grain, new wine, and oil,</b><br>The "fruit of your womb" refers to offspring, highlighting the importance of children in Israelite society as a continuation of the family line and as contributors to the community's strength. The "produce of your land" includes essential agricultural products: grain, wine, and oil, which were staples in the diet and economy of ancient Israel. These blessings are tied to the land's fertility, a direct result of God's favor and a fulfillment of the covenant promises. The mention of grain, wine, and oil also connects to the offerings made in the temple, symbolizing God's provision and the people's gratitude.<p><b>the young of your herds and the lambs of your flocks&#8212;</b><br>Livestock was a critical component of Israel's agrarian society, providing food, clothing, and economic stability. The increase in herds and flocks signifies prosperity and security. This promise of abundance is reminiscent of the blessings outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, where obedience to God's commandments results in material and familial prosperity. The mention of herds and flocks also has sacrificial connotations, as these animals were often used in offerings to God, symbolizing worship and atonement.<p><b>in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;to give their descendants the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The land is not just a physical territory but a symbol of God's faithfulness and the realization of His covenant. The historical context involves the Israelites' journey from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, a journey marked by trials and divine intervention. The land is a tangible representation of God's promise and a place where His people can live in obedience and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who promises blessings to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recipients of His promises and blessings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land sworn to the forefathers of Israel, a place of abundance and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/forefathers.htm">Forefathers (Patriarchs)</a></b><br>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom God originally made His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_blessings.htm">Covenant Blessings</a></b><br>The specific blessings promised by God as part of His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.

The word is often rendered in the Authorized Version by new wine, and this is the meaning generally given in the lexicons. As, however, it is almost constantly joined with corn and oil, the immediate products of the soil - at least as unchanged by any process or manufacture - it is rather to be regarded as designating ripe grapes than wine. That, moreover, which was to be <span class="accented">gathered</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>), which might be <span class="accented">tithed</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>), which might be described as <span class="accented">fruit</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>), as <span class="accented">being in the cluster</span> (<a href="/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>), and as capable of being <span class="accented">dried up</span> or <span class="accented">parched</span> (<a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>), and <span class="accented">trodden</span> (<a href="/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>), could not be a fluid like fermented nine. As the grape juice, however, was that from which wine was elicited, <span class="accented">tirosh</span> is sometimes used tropically for wine (<a href="/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>), Just as corn is used for bread (<a href="/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>). The <span class="accented">oil</span> here mentioned, and elsewhere joined with <span class="accented">dagan</span> and <span class="accented">tirosh</span>, is the pure fresh olive oil (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine), obtained by pressure from the berries of the olive, and used for food as well as for other purposes by the Jews (see notes on Deuteronomy 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">Flocks of thy sheep.</span> The Hebrew is very peculiar here; the same expression occurs only in this book (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4, 18, 51</a>). Literally rendered, it is <span class="accented">the Astartes</span> (Ashtaroth) <span class="accented">of thy sheep</span>. Kimchi says it means "the females of the sheep" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>), and this Gesenius adopts, rendering the phrase by "ewes." Astarte ('Ash-toreth, plu. 'Ashtaroth) was the Phoenician Venus, and it is supposed that the females of the flock were called Astartes orVenuses, as propagating the flock. There is, however, another way of explaining the word as here used, by referring it to a root '<span class="accented">ashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), signifying to be multiplied, to be rich; whence the name given to the females as the multipliers of the flock, without any reference to Astarte. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will love you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
