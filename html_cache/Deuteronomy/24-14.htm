In ancient Israel, laborers often depended on daily wages for survival, making them susceptible to exploitation. The prohibition against oppression aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, which also warns against withholding wages. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a> condemns the withholding of wages from laborers, emphasizing God's care for the poor and needy.<p><b>whether he is a brother</b><br>The term "brother" refers to fellow Israelites, highlighting the importance of treating one's kin with fairness and respect. This reflects the covenant community's responsibility to uphold God's laws and maintain social harmony. The concept of brotherhood in Israel is rooted in their shared ancestry and covenant relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>, which encourages generosity towards fellow Israelites in need.<p><b>or a foreigner residing in one of your towns</b><br>The inclusion of foreigners underscores the universal application of God's justice. In ancient Israel, foreigners, or "sojourners," were often marginalized and lacked the same rights as native-born Israelites. However, God's law provided protections for them, as seen in <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a> and <a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>, which command Israel to love and treat foreigners as they would their own people.
