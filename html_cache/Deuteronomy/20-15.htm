It reflects the divine command for how Israel was to conduct warfare, emphasizing obedience to God's directives. The context is the broader set of laws given in Deuteronomy, which outlines how Israel is to live as a holy nation set apart for God.<p><b>all the cities that are far away from you</b><br>The cities referred to here are those outside the immediate land of Canaan, which God had promised to the Israelites. These cities are distinguished from those within the Promised Land, which were subject to different rules of engagement. This distinction underscores the unique covenant relationship between God and Israel concerning the land of Canaan. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of differentiating between local and distant enemies.<p><b>and do not belong to the nations nearby.</b><br>The nations nearby refer to the Canaanite tribes that inhabited the land God promised to Israel. These nations were subject to complete destruction due to their idolatry and moral corruption, as seen in other parts of Deuteronomy and the book of Joshua. This phrase highlights the separation between Israel and the surrounding pagan cultures, emphasizing the need for Israel to remain pure and devoted to God. Theologically, it points to the concept of holiness and the call for God's people to be distinct from the world, a theme echoed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to conduct warfare.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_far_away.htm">Cities Far Away</a></b><br>Refers to cities outside the immediate vicinity of the Promised Land, indicating a different approach in warfare.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_nearby.htm">Nations Nearby</a></b><br>The Canaanite nations within the Promised Land, which were to be treated differently according to God's command.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites were to inhabit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_justice.htm">Understanding God's Justice</a></b><br>God's instructions for warfare reflect His justice and sovereignty.

If peace is accepted, the people become Israel&#8217;s servants (v. 11), a merciful alternative to total destruction.<p>&#8226; If peace is refused, Israel may lay siege, trusting the LORD who fights for them (<a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>).<p>&#8226;
