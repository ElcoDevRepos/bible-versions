The setting is the plains of Moab, just before the Israelites are to enter the Promised Land. This moment is significant as it marks a reaffirmation of the covenant initially given at Sinai. The presence of the people signifies their collective responsibility and commitment to uphold the covenant. This gathering underscores the communal aspect of the covenant, where each individual is part of a larger body, reflecting the unity and shared purpose of God's chosen people.<p><b>in the presence of the LORD our God</b><br>The presence of the LORD signifies the solemnity and divine authority of the covenant. It is not merely a human agreement but one that is made before God, who is both witness and enforcer. This phrase highlights the theocratic nature of Israel's society, where God is the ultimate ruler. The presence of God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with His guidance, protection, and judgment. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of God dwelling among His people through the Holy Spirit, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>.<p><b>as well as with those who are not here today</b><br>This extends the covenant beyond the immediate audience to future generations, indicating its perpetual nature. It underscores the idea that God's promises and requirements are not limited by time or physical presence. This forward-looking aspect of the covenant is a reminder of the enduring nature of God's word and His faithfulness across generations. It also points to the inclusivity of God's plan, which ultimately finds fulfillment in the New Testament with the inclusion of the Gentiles, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24-26</a>.

Every Israelite&#8212;leaders, tribes, elders, officers, men, women, children, and resident foreigners&#8212;has been called to stand before the Lord (29:10-11).
