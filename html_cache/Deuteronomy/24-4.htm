The term "defiled" here is not a moral judgment on the woman but a legal status under the Mosaic Law. This law was intended to prevent the casual treatment of marriage and divorce, emphasizing the sanctity and seriousness of the marriage covenant. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was a binding covenant, and this law served to protect the dignity of women and the integrity of the family unit. The prohibition also underscores the importance of commitment and fidelity, reflecting God's covenant relationship with Israel. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks against divorce and remarriage in <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8-9</a>, emphasizing the original intent of marriage as a lifelong union.<p><b>for that is an abomination to the LORD</b><br>The term "abomination" is used in the Old Testament to describe actions that are detestable or repugnant to God. This strong language indicates the seriousness with which God views the violation of His commandments regarding marriage. The use of "abomination" highlights the moral and spiritual implications of such actions, suggesting that they disrupt the divine order and purpose for human relationships. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God's laws are designed to promote holiness and righteousness among His people. The concept of abomination is also found in other contexts, such as idolatry and unjust practices, indicating behaviors that are fundamentally opposed to God's nature and will.<p><b>You must not bring sin upon the land</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of sin and its consequences. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the actions of individuals could affect the entire community, and sin was seen as having tangible effects on the land itself. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's laws was directly linked to the nation's well-being and prosperity. The land was a gift from God, and maintaining its sanctity was a collective responsibility. This principle is seen throughout the Old Testament, where the land's condition is often tied to the people's faithfulness to God, as in <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>.<p><b>that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance</b><br>The concept of the land as an inheritance is central to the identity and mission of Israel. It signifies not only a physical territory but also a spiritual heritage and a fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The land was a tangible sign of God's covenant faithfulness and a place where His people were to live out His commandments and reflect His character to the nations. This inheritance was conditional upon Israel's obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on their adherence to God's laws. The idea of inheritance also points forward to the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ, inheriting the kingdom of God (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_first_husband.htm">The First Husband</a></b><br>The man who initially divorced his wife.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wife.htm">The Wife</a></b><br>The woman who was divorced and then remarried to another man.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land God is giving to the Israelites as an inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_marriage.htm">Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, and it should not be entered into or dissolved lightly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_divorce.htm">Consequences of Divorce</a></b><br>Divorce has spiritual and communal consequences, affecting not just the individuals but the community and land.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_standards.htm">God's Holiness and Standards</a></b><br>God's laws reflect His holiness and are designed to maintain purity among His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>While the law prohibits remarriage to a former spouse after defilement, it points to the need for repentance and seeking God's restoration in broken relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_sin.htm">Guarding Against Sin</a></b><br>The Israelites were warned not to bring sin upon the land, reminding us to be vigilant in maintaining righteousness in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_24_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 24:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_4_Marriage_sanctity_in_God_s_view.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:4 emphasize the sanctity of marriage in God's eyes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_24_4_Remarrying_consequences.htm">What are the consequences of remarrying a former spouse according to Deuteronomy 24:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_24_4_Matt_19_on_divorce.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:4 connect with Jesus' teachings on divorce in Matthew 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_uphold_Deut_24_4_commands_today.htm">Why is it important to uphold God's commands in Deuteronomy 24:4 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_4_s_role_in_Christian_purity.htm">How can Deuteronomy 24:4 guide Christians in maintaining purity in relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_can_t_ex-spouses_remarry_in_Deut_24_4.htm">Why does Deuteronomy 24:4 prohibit remarriage to a former spouse after divorce?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_4_God_s_stance_on_marriage_divorce.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:4 reflect God's view on marriage and divorce?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_culture_shaped_Deut_24_4_command.htm">What cultural context influenced the command in Deuteronomy 24:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_women's_rights.htm">What does the Bible say about women's rights?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god_renew_israel's_covenant.htm">How can God renew a covenant with Israel in Jeremiah 3:1&#8211;8 despite Deuteronomy 24:1&#8211;4 forbidding reunions after divorce?
