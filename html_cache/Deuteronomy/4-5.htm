The "statutes and ordinances" refer to the laws given by God, which include moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. These laws were meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation. The teaching of these laws underscores the importance of obedience and the transmission of divine wisdom. This echoes the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where God gave the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20).<p><b>just as the LORD my God has commanded me</b><br>Moses highlights his obedience to God's instructions, reinforcing his authority as a prophet and leader. This phrase underscores the divine origin of the laws, affirming that they are not human inventions but commands from God Himself. It reflects the biblical principle that leaders are to follow God's directives faithfully, as seen in other leaders like Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-8</a>).<p><b>so that you may follow them</b><br>The purpose of teaching these laws is for the Israelites to live by them. Obedience is central to the covenant relationship with God, and it is through following these laws that the Israelites demonstrate their faithfulness. This concept is reiterated throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which emphasizes being doers of the word.<p><b>in the land that you are about to enter and possess</b><br>This refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God swore to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The land is not just a physical territory but a place where the Israelites are to live out their covenantal relationship with God. The possession of the land is contingent upon their obedience to God's laws, as seen in the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The land serves as a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is speaking to the people, reminding them of the laws and commandments given by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are about to enter the Promised Land after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who has given the statutes and ordinances to Moses for the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the commandments from God, which he is now reiterating to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commandments.htm">Obedience to God's Commandments</a></b><br>The importance of following God's statutes and ordinances as a demonstration of faith and commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_god's_promises.htm">Preparation for God's Promises</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were preparing to enter the Promised Land, believers today must prepare their hearts to receive God's promises through obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_spiritual_guidance.htm">The Role of Leadership in Spiritual Guidance</a></b><br>Moses serves as a model for spiritual leadership, emphasizing the responsibility to teach and guide others in God's ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_of_god's_law.htm">Continuity of God's Law</a></b><br>The laws given to the Israelites are foundational and continue to have spiritual significance for Christians today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>The statutes and ordinances set the Israelites apart as God's people; similarly, Christians are called to live distinct and holy lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_4_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 4:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Deut_4_5_teachings_daily.htm">How can we implement Deuteronomy 4:5's teachings in our daily lives today?

Israel was thus exalted because God was nigh to them, ready to hear their cry and to give them what they needed; which none of the gods of the nations were or could be to their votaries; and because, in the Law which God had given them, they had such instruction and direction as no heathen nation possessed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">See,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;
