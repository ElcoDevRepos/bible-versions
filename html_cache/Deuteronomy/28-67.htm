In the context of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, this is part of the curses that would befall Israel if they disobeyed God's commandments. The longing for evening in the morning signifies a desire to escape the present moment due to overwhelming fear and uncertainty. Historically, this can be connected to the periods of siege and captivity that Israel experienced, such as the Babylonian exile, where daily life was filled with dread and suffering. This sentiment echoes the despair found in <a href="/lamentations/3-17.htm">Lamentations 3:17</a>, where the prophet Jeremiah laments the loss of peace and hope.<p><b>and in the evening you will say, &#8216;If only it were morning!&#8217;</b><br>The reversal of longing for morning in the evening further emphasizes the continuous cycle of fear and hopelessness. This reflects a life devoid of peace, where neither day nor night offers relief. The cultural context of ancient Israel, where night often symbolized danger and uncertainty, heightens the sense of vulnerability. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given by the prophets, such as in <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>, where people look to the earth and see only distress and darkness.<p><b>because of the dread in your hearts</b><br>The dread mentioned here is a deep-seated fear that affects the heart, the center of emotion and will in biblical anthropology. This dread is not just a reaction to external circumstances but also a spiritual consequence of turning away from God. The heart, often seen as the seat of faith and trust in God, becomes a place of terror when disconnected from Him. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>, where the wicked flee when no one pursues, illustrating the internal turmoil that comes from living outside of God's covenant.<p><b>of the terrifying sights you will see.</b><br>The terrifying sights refer to the physical manifestations of the curses, such as war, famine, and disease, which were common consequences of disobedience as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. These sights would have been literal and immediate for the Israelites, as seen in the historical accounts of invasions and destructions, like those by the Assyrians and Babylonians. This phrase also serves as a prophetic warning, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment and separation from God for those who persist in rebellion. In a typological sense, it contrasts with the peace and security found in Christ, who offers rest for the weary and burdened, as promised in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and warnings to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the blessings and curses based on their obedience or disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, contingent on their faithfulness to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, involving blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/curses.htm">Curses</a></b><br>The consequences outlined in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for Israel's disobedience, including fear and dread.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The verse highlights the severe emotional and psychological consequences of turning away from God.
