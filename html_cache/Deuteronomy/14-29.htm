Rashi's opinion is worth notice chiefly for the following reason. Some modern critics insist that the Law of Deuteronomy is contradictory to that of Numbers in respect of tithe; but if the Jews, who kept the whole Law strictly, not only saw no discrepancy between its several precepts, but actually took the precept in Deuteronomy to imply the precept in Numbers, why should we go out of our way to make difficulties now? If the precepts were harmonious and compatible, why should they be the work of different men? It is hardly likely that a whole nation would consent to <span class= "ital">pay double tithes</span>, <span class= "ital">and acknowledge the obligation to do so by perpetual enactment, if the laws that commanded the tithe were contradictory. </span>And the more closely we look at the subject, the more clearly will the distinction between the first and second tithes appear. The first was only an ordinary rate for the support of the Levitical ministry. No sacredness attached to it. The second was a tithe taken for Jehovah, "that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God always" (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-23.htm" title="And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>). The tithe was either to be a joyful feast for the family, or a special gift to God's poor. It furnished a table spread by the God of Israel for the entertainment of His guests. Why this should be confused with the ordinary rate for the maintenance of the Levitical ministry, it is not easy to understand.<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Levite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1493;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hal&#183;l&#234;&#183;w&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
