This phrase indicates the Israelites' journey as they approached the territory of the Ammonites. The Ammonites lived east of the Jordan River, in what is now modern-day Jordan. Their land was situated north of Moab, another nation descended from Lot. The Israelites were instructed to respect the boundaries of the Ammonites, highlighting the importance of recognizing God's sovereign distribution of land among nations.<p><b>do not harass them or provoke them</b><br>This command underscores the principle of respecting God's ordained boundaries and the peaceful coexistence with neighboring nations. The Israelites were to avoid conflict with the Ammonites, as their land was not part of the inheritance promised to Israel. This reflects a broader biblical theme of living peaceably with others when possible (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). It also demonstrates God's justice and faithfulness in honoring His promises to other peoples, not just Israel.<p><b>for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites</b><br>God explicitly states that the land of the Ammonites is not part of Israel's inheritance. This reinforces the idea that God has a specific plan and purpose for each nation. The Israelites were to trust in God's provision and timing for their own inheritance, which was the land of Canaan. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over all nations and His authority to allocate lands according to His will.<p><b>I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession.</b><br>This statement highlights God's faithfulness to His promises, even to those outside the covenant community of Israel. The descendants of Lot, through his daughters, were granted their own territories, demonstrating God's grace and provision. This allocation of land to the Ammonites and Moabites (Lot's other descendants) is a testament to God's broader plan for humanity and His care for all peoples. It also serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of biblical history, as Lot was closely related to Abraham, the patriarch of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A people descended from Lot, Abraham's nephew.
