They were direct witnesses to God's mighty acts, which underscores the authenticity and reliability of the events described. In the biblical context, seeing with one's own eyes is often associated with accountability and responsibility. The Israelites' personal witness to God's power leaves them without excuse for disbelief or disobedience. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where the apostles are described as eyewitnesses to Jesus' life and resurrection (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><b>the great trials</b><br>The "great trials" refer to the various tests and challenges the Israelites faced during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. These trials include the plagues in Egypt, the crossing of the Red Sea, and the hardships in the wilderness. Each trial served as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, as well as a test of the Israelites' faith and obedience. The trials are reminiscent of the testing of faith described in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, which produces perseverance and maturity.<p><b>and those miraculous signs</b><br>The "miraculous signs" are the extraordinary events that God performed to demonstrate His power and authority. These include the ten plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna and water in the desert. Such signs served as evidence of God's presence and intervention on behalf of His people. In the New Testament, Jesus performed signs and miracles to authenticate His divine mission and to reveal the Kingdom of God (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p><b>and wonders</b><br>"Wonders" refers to the awe-inspiring acts of God that evoke amazement and reverence. These acts are often beyond human understanding and serve to reveal God's glory and sovereignty. The wonders performed during the Exodus narrative are foundational to Israel's identity as God's chosen people. In a broader biblical context, wonders are seen as a means by which God communicates His power and purpose, as seen in the prophetic literature and the ministry of Jesus (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's message to the people as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who witnessed the miraculous signs and wonders during their exodus from Egypt and their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, where many of the miraculous signs and wonders occurred.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years, experiencing God's provision and discipline.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, fulfilling God's promise to their ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_power.htm">Recognizing God's Power</a></b><br>The Israelites witnessed God's power firsthand through miraculous signs and wonders.
