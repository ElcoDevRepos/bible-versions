Kadesh-barnea was a key location where the Israelites initially refused to enter the Promised Land due to fear and lack of faith (Numbers 13-14). The Brook of Zered represents the boundary of their wanderings, symbolizing a transition from judgment to a new beginning. This journey reflects the consequences of disobedience and the patience required in God's timing.<p><b>was thirty-eight years</b><br>The duration of thirty-eight years highlights the prolonged period of wandering due to Israel's disobedience. This time frame, nearly four decades, emphasizes the severity of the punishment for their lack of faith. It serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting God's promises and the consequences of rebellion. This period is part of the total forty years of wandering, with the first two years including the initial journey to Kadesh-barnea.<p><b>until that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp</b><br>The "fighting men" refers to the adult males who were counted in the census and were capable of military service. Their perishing was a direct result of their refusal to trust God to conquer the land of Canaan. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's judgment on that generation, as none of them, except for Caleb and Joshua, were allowed to enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>). It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of unbelief.<p><b>as the LORD had sworn to them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and seriousness of God's promises, both in blessing and in judgment. The LORD's oath to the Israelites was a binding declaration that their disobedience would result in their exclusion from the Promised Land. It highlights God's faithfulness to His word, whether in promises of blessing or in warnings of judgment. This also points to the importance of obedience and faith in the life of believers, as God's word is unchanging and trustworthy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh-barnea.htm">Kadesh-barnea</a></b><br>A significant location in the wilderness where the Israelites camped and from where the spies were sent into Canaan.

A plague intervened, which cut off twenty-four thousand. The observation that at the brook Zered all the men of the older generation were "wasted out of the host" indicates an intimate knowledge of the incidents of the exodus. But it is quite natural to suppose that, as the survivors of that generation became fewer, those who remained would become marked men. Every man of the twelve tribes (excluding Levi? ) who passed the census at Sinai was doomed. The fortieth year of the exodus had more than half expired when they came to the brook Zered. All who remained alive in that year knew that they had a short time to live.
