The act of writing signifies the importance and permanence of the message. In biblical history, songs were often used to commemorate significant events or teachings (e.g., the Song of Moses in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>). This particular song serves as a divine directive, emphasizing the importance of remembering God's laws and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>and teach it to the Israelites;</b><br>Teaching the song to the Israelites underscores the communal aspect of learning and accountability. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, teaching was often done in a communal setting, ensuring that all members of the community, including future generations, would understand and remember the teachings. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where the community is collectively responsible for upholding God's commandments.<p><b>have them recite it,</b><br>Recitation was a common practice in ancient times for memorization and internalization of important texts. By reciting the song, the Israelites would continually remind themselves of its message, reinforcing their commitment to God's covenant. This practice is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children through constant repetition.<p><b>so that it may be a witness for Me against them.</b><br>The song serves as a witness, a legal term indicating testimony or evidence. In this context, it acts as a reminder of the covenant and the consequences of breaking it. The song's role as a witness highlights the seriousness of Israel's commitment to God and the reality of divine judgment. This concept of a witness is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>, where a stone is set up as a witness to the covenant between God and Israel. The song foreshadows the prophetic role of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate witness to God's truth and the fulfillment of the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is instructed by God to write down a song as a witness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who are to learn and sing the song as a testimony.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the command, seeking to remind His people of their covenant and His faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song.htm">The Song</a></b><br>A divinely inspired composition meant to serve as a witness and reminder of God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination of the Israelites, where they are to live out the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_remembrance.htm">The Power of Remembrance</a></b><br>Songs and other forms of art can be powerful tools for remembering God's works and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_witness.htm">The Role of Witness</a></b><br>The song serves as a witness, reminding us that our actions are always before God and that we are accountable to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/teaching_the_next_generation.htm">Teaching the Next Generation</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to teach the song to their children, we are called to pass down the truths of Scripture to future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The song is a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the blessings of following God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's future unfaithfulness, the song underscores God's unwavering faithfulness to His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_31_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 31:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_31_19_Remember_God_s_laws_today.htm">How does Deuteronomy 31:19 emphasize the importance of remembering God's commandments today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Music_s_role_in_teaching_God_s_word.htm">What role does music play in teaching and remembering God's word in Deuteronomy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_write_reminders_of_God_s_laws.htm">How can we implement the practice of writing reminders of God's laws today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_31_19_Ps_119_on_God_s_word.htm">How does Deuteronomy 31:19 connect with Psalm 119 regarding God's word in our hearts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_songs_teach_God_s_faithfulness.htm">In what ways can we use songs to teach future generations about God's faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_ask_Moses_to_write_a_song.htm">Why did God command Moses to write a song in Deuteronomy 31:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_31_19_shows_God_s_foresight_of_Israel.htm">How does Deuteronomy 31:19 reflect God's foreknowledge of Israel's future disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Song_s_role_as_witness_in_Deut_31_19.htm">What is the significance of a song as a witness in Deuteronomy 31:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_31.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_music.htm">What is the Bible's perspective on music?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_music's_role_in_church.htm">What is music's role and purpose in the church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_strict_penalties_align_with_forgiveness.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15-19: How can a strict penalty for false witnesses reconcile with passages elsewhere in the Bible that emphasize forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_joshua_24_14-15_reconcile_idolatry.htm">Joshua 24:14-15 -

The verse calls believers today to cherish Scripture in written form, teach it diligently, memorize it intentionally, and let it stand as both guide and guardian of our walk with the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness.</span>--This method of perpetuating the truth was even better adapted to the times and to the condition of the people than the delivery of a written law. It was not possible to multiply copies of the law among them to any great extent; but the rhythmical form of the song would make it easy to be retained in their memories. There is reason to believe that Samuel, the first person who (so far as we know) effected anything of importance towards the establishment of a system of religious education in Israel, employed the same means for the purpose, viz., psalms and spiritual songs. The first companies of prophets were evidently singers and minstrels (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5-6</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20-24</a>); hence their remarkable influence over Saul. And if they taught the psalms to the people, as they learnt them under Samuel and David--especially historical psalms, like the 78th, 105th, and 106th--a very efficacious means of spreading the knowledge of God in Israel was in their hands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write ye this song</span>.
