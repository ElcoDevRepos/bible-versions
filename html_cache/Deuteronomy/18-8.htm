Instead, they were supported by the offerings and sacrifices of the people. The equal portions signify fairness and the communal sharing of resources among the priests, ensuring that all who serve in the temple are provided for. This reflects the principle of God's provision for those dedicated to His service, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul discusses the rights of those who preach the gospel to receive their living from it.<p><b>even though he has received money from the sale of his father&#8217;s estate</b><br>This clause addresses a situation where a Levite, who might have personal wealth or inheritance from his father's estate, is still entitled to the same support as other priests. The mention of receiving money from a sale indicates that Levites could possess personal property, but their service to God was not to be influenced by their financial status. This provision ensures that all Levites, regardless of personal wealth, are treated equally in their priestly duties. It underscores the principle that service to God is not dependent on personal wealth, echoing the New Testament teaching in <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>, where the early church shared resources so that no one was in need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service to God.
