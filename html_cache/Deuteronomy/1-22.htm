It reflects the communal nature of the Israelite society, where decisions were often made collectively. This moment occurs as the Israelites are on the brink of entering the Promised Land, a pivotal point in their journey. The approach to Moses signifies respect for his leadership and acknowledgment of his role as God's appointed leader. This collective approach can be compared to other instances in Scripture where the community comes together, such as in <a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>, when the people agree to the covenant at Sinai.<p><b>&#8220;Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land</b><br>The request to send men to scout the land demonstrates a desire for strategic planning and caution. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of sending spies or scouts to gather intelligence before military or migratory actions. The Israelites' request shows a lack of faith in God's promise, as He had already assured them of the land's goodness (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This act of sending spies is later recounted in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, where the consequences of their lack of faith become evident. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith, contrasting human wisdom with divine promise.<p><b>and bring us word of what route to follow</b><br>The need for guidance on the route highlights the Israelites' dependence on God for direction, despite their attempt to rely on human reconnaissance. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as the guide and shepherd of His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>, where God leads in paths of righteousness. The Israelites' request for a route also underscores the practical challenges of navigating unknown territories, emphasizing the need for divine guidance in life's journey.<p><b>and which cities to enter.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of cities indicates the Israelites' awareness of the Canaanite urban centers they would encounter. This reflects the historical and cultural context of Canaan, a land with established city-states and fortified cities. The request to know which cities to enter suggests a strategic approach to conquest, recognizing the need to prioritize certain targets. This foreshadows the later military campaigns in the Book of Joshua, where specific cities like Jericho and Ai are targeted. Theologically, this can be seen as a precursor to the spiritual battles believers face, with the need for discernment and reliance on God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, recounting the events that took place as they prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were delivered from Egypt and are now on the brink of entering Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that God had sworn to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/spies.htm">Spies</a></b><br>Representatives from each tribe of Israel sent to scout the land of Canaan and report back.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their lack of faith and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith.htm">The Importance of Faith</a></b><br>The Israelites' request to send spies reflects a lack of trust in God's promise.

Their collective movement shows shared anticipation&#8212;much like when Israel earlier &#8220;stood at a distance&#8221; but &#8220;drew near&#8221; to hear God&#8217;s voice at Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-27.htm">Deuteronomy 5:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>). This approach is not rebellion; it is earnest engagement. They stand before God&#8217;s appointed leader, picturing the body of Christ today gathering to seek direction (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>Words matter. Israel voices a request, echoing an earlier pattern of speaking their hearts before Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-24.htm">Exodus 18:24</a>). Though the desire seems practical, it will later reveal hearts wrestling with trust (<a href="/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a>). Our speech still reveals faith or fear (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let us send men ahead of us&#8221;</b><p>The idea springs from the people, not from God&#8212;yet the Lord later accommodates it (<a href="/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-2</a>). They want scouts, anticipating Joshua&#8217;s later practice of sending two spies into Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>). Initiative can be godly, but motives must rest on faith (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to search out the land</b><p>Reconnaissance is reasonable. Abraham once surveyed Canaan by God&#8217;s command (<a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a>). Still, Israel already had God&#8217;s promise of a &#8220;good land&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-25.htm">Deuteronomy 1:25</a>). When assurance from God&#8217;s Word is clear, additional proof-seeking can slide toward doubt (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bring us word</b><p>Information gathering aims to build confidence. <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a> commends wise counsel, yet counsel must reinforce, not replace, trust in the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).

But He had already promised to &#8220;go before&#8221; them (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30-33</a>). Planning is good stewardship (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-31</a>); it becomes unbelief when it dismisses God&#8217;s guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and which cities to enter</b><p>Targeting key cities sounds strategic, anticipating later victories at Jericho and Ai (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6&#8211;8</a>). Yet the Lord had pledged to deliver every city (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). Strategy must submit to sovereignty; otherwise, fear of fortified walls (<a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28</a>) will override faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22</a> captures a people poised between faith and sight. Their unified request for scouts appears sensible, yet betrays a subtle reluctance to take God at His word. Scripture affirms planning and information, but only under the umbrella of wholehearted trust in the Lord who already promises the victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And ye came near . . . and said, We will send.</span>--A new aspect is here given to the sending of the twelve spies.
