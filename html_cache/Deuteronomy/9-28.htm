The Exodus was a significant event, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness. The concern here is about God's reputation among the nations. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the reputation of a deity was often tied to the success of its people. If the Israelites failed to enter the Promised Land, it would reflect poorly on Yahweh's power and faithfulness.<p><b>&#8216;Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them</b><br>This statement challenges God's omnipotence and faithfulness. The Promised Land, Canaan, was a central element of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The failure to enter would suggest a breach of this covenant. This reflects a common theme in Scripture where God's ability and faithfulness are questioned, as seen in <a href="/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> and <a href="/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>. It underscores the importance of God's promises and His ability to fulfill them.<p><b>and because He hated them</b><br>This phrase suggests a misunderstanding of God's intentions. In Deuteronomy, God's love and choice of Israel are emphasized (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). The accusation of hatred contrasts with the biblical narrative of God's steadfast love and covenant loyalty. This reflects a human tendency to misinterpret divine actions, especially in times of trial or judgment.<p><b>He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.&#8217;</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of testing and dependence on God. The Israelites' journey through the wilderness was marked by challenges and divine provision (Exodus 16-17). This accusation echoes the complaints of the Israelites themselves (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2-3</a>).

He is pleading that God not wipe out the nation, and the word &#8220;Otherwise&#8221; signals the consequence he fears if judgment falls. Moses reasons from God&#8217;s own glory: if Israel perishes, the surrounding nations will draw the wrong conclusion about the Lord&#8217;s character. This same line of intercession shows up earlier in <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a> and later in <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13&#8211;16</a>&#8212;both times God listens, underscoring that He values His name and reputation (<a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>those in the land from which You brought us out will say</b><p>&#8220;The land&#8221; refers to Egypt. Egyptians had witnessed the plagues, the Passover, and the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;14</a>). They knew Yahweh as the God who overthrew Pharaoh. Moses worries they will reinterpret all they saw if Israel never reaches Canaan. Their potential accusation presses two truths:<p>&#8226; God cares what the nations think of Him (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s mission was always missional&#8212;meant to display God&#8217;s greatness to all peoples (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them</b><p>The first imagined charge is impotence. If Israel dies in the desert, observers may assume the Lord&#8217;s power ran out at the border of Canaan. Cross references reinforce God&#8217;s unlimited might:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37&#8211;38</a>&#8212;He drives out nations &#8220;greater and stronger than you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>&#8212;David proclaims, &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s,&#8221; countering any hint of divine weakness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and because He hated them</b><p>The second accusation questions God&#8217;s goodness. Strangely, unbelievers might claim Israel&#8217;s God rescued them only to vent His anger on them. Scripture flatly denies such a motive:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7&#8211;8</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD loved you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;I have loved you with an everlasting love.&#8221;<p>Moses knows God&#8217;s covenant love (hesed) is steadfast, so he appeals to it, not letting a distorted narrative stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness</b><p>This conclusion combines the two slanders&#8212;God is powerless and malicious. Yet the wilderness actually served positive purposes:<p>&#8226; A training ground to teach reliance on God&#8217;s word (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; A place where God&#8217;s presence, protection, and provision were daily evident (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-19.htm">Nehemiah 9:19&#8211;21</a>).<p>Far from being a death trap, the desert became the classroom of grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a> captures Moses&#8217; intercessory logic: he pleads that God preserve Israel so the nations cannot misjudge Him as weak or hateful. The verse highlights two pillars of divine revelation&#8212;God&#8217;s power to keep His promises and His covenant love for His people. By sparing Israel, the Lord vindicated His name before Egypt and every other nation and demonstrated again that His purposes cannot fail and His heart is for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land</span>, that is, the people of the land, as in <a href="/genesis/41-36.htm">Genesis 41:36</a> - the Egyptians; the verb, accordingly, is in the plural. Were the Israelites to perish in the wilder<span class="accented">ness</span>, the Egyptians might say that God had destroyed them, either because he was unable to obtain for them the land he had promised them, or because he had ceased to regard them with favor, and had become their enemy. Neither of these could be, for were they not the people of his inheritance, and had he not showed his power already in delivering them out of Egypt? As Moses in this chapter recalls to the remembrance of Israel this and that <span class="accented">place</span>, <span class="accented">time</span>, and <span class="accented">occasion</span> of their sinning, so should each one often seriously reflect on his past life.
