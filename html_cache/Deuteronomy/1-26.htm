Historically, this event took place at Kadesh Barnea, where the Israelites were poised to enter Canaan. The reluctance to "go up" signifies a lack of faith and trust in God's promise. This moment is pivotal as it reflects the broader theme of Israel's disobedience and lack of faith, which is a recurring issue throughout their wilderness journey. The phrase "go up" is often used in the Old Testament to describe moving towards a place of significance, in this case, the land God had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.</b><br>Rebellion against God's command is a serious charge, highlighting the Israelites' disobedience and lack of trust. This rebellion is documented in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>, where the spies' negative report about the land led to fear and distrust among the people. The term "rebelled" indicates a deliberate and conscious decision to oppose God's will, which is a theme seen throughout the Old Testament. This act of rebellion resulted in severe consequences, including the decree that the current generation would not enter the Promised Land, as seen in <a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>. Theologically, this rebellion can be seen as a type of sin that separates humanity from God, a concept that is ultimately addressed through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting the events of their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh-barnea.htm">Kadesh-barnea</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites camped and from where they were supposed to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commanded the Israelites to take possession of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' refusal to enter the Promised Land resulted in a 40-year wilderness wandering.
