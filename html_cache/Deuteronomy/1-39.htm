The Israelites, in their lack of faith, feared that their children would be taken as captives by the inhabitants of Canaan. This reflects the broader theme of fear and distrust in God's promises that characterized the generation that left Egypt. Historically, the fear of children being taken captive was a legitimate concern in ancient warfare, where victors often enslaved the defeated population. However, God reassures them that their fears are unfounded, as He has a plan for these children.<p><b>your children who on that day did not know good from evil&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the innocence of the children at the time of the Israelites' rebellion. The concept of "not knowing good from evil" is reminiscent of the innocence of Adam and Eve before the Fall (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). It suggests a lack of moral culpability, indicating that these children were not held accountable for the sins of their parents. This can be connected to the broader biblical principle that individuals are responsible for their own sins (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). Theologically, it underscores the idea of an age of accountability, where God judges individuals based on their understanding and actions.<p><b>will enter the land that I will give them,</b><br>This promise from God assures that the children, unlike their parents, will enter the Promised Land. It emphasizes God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, despite the disobedience of the Exodus generation. The land of Canaan, promised to the patriarchs, is a central theme in the Pentateuch, symbolizing God's provision and blessing. This promise also foreshadows the eventual conquest of Canaan under Joshua, where the new generation fulfills what their parents could not achieve.<p><b>and they will possess it.</b><br>The possession of the land signifies the fulfillment of God's promise and the establishment of Israel as a nation. It is a testament to God's sovereignty and the unfolding of His redemptive plan. Theologically, this possession can be seen as a type of the ultimate rest and inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>). The land serves as a physical representation of God's kingdom, where His people live under His rule and blessing. This phrase assures that despite past failures, God's purposes will prevail, and His promises will be realized through the faithful remnant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's message to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, who were wandering in the wilderness due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>- The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>- The next generation of Israelites who were to inherit the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>- The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their lack of faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/innocence_and_trust.htm">Innocence and Trust</a></b><br>The children of Israel, who did not yet know good from evil, symbolize innocence and trust.

Thus, when Laban and Bethuel said to Abraham's servant "We cannot speak unto thee bad or good" (<a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>), the meaning is, We can say nothing at all. Absalom spake to Amnon "neither good nor bad" (<a href="/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a>); that is, he did not say anything to him. The woman of Tekoa said to David, "As an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad" (<a href="/2_samuel/14-17.htm">2 Samuel 14:17</a>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. There is nothing the king does not know - his knowledge is universal. Hence to know good and evil came to mean to be intelligent, and not to know good and evil to be unintelligent, as is a babe.
