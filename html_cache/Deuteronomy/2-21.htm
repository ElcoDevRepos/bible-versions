The Anakites were a race of giants mentioned in the Bible, known for their intimidating stature and presence, which instilled fear in the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>). The Rephaim's comparison to the Anakites highlights their significant physical prowess and the challenge they posed to other nations. This context emphasizes the miraculous nature of their defeat, as it was not by human strength but by divine intervention.<p><b>But the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites,</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the sovereignty and power of God in the affairs of nations. The destruction of the Rephaim by the LORD indicates divine judgment and intervention, similar to other instances in the Old Testament where God acts on behalf of His people or to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>). The Ammonites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), were given this land as part of God's providential plan, showing that God orchestrates the rise and fall of nations according to His will.<p><b>who drove them out and settled in their place,</b><br>The Ammonites' ability to drive out the Rephaim and settle in their land demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise and His provision for the descendants of Lot. This mirrors the experiences of the Israelites, who were also promised land by God and had to rely on His power to conquer it (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>). The settlement of the Ammonites in the land previously occupied by the Rephaim serves as a testament to God's faithfulness in providing for those He chooses, and it foreshadows the Israelites' own conquest of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anakim.htm">The Anakim</a></b><br>A race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament, known for their great size and strength.
