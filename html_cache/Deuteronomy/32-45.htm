Moses, as the leader and prophet, is delivering his farewell speech, which includes the Song of Moses. This song serves as a witness against Israel should they turn away from God. The act of reciting indicates the oral tradition prevalent in ancient times, where important teachings and laws were memorized and passed down verbally.<p><b>all these words</b><br>"All these words" refers to the entirety of the Song of Moses, which is a poetic summary of God's dealings with Israel, their history, and a prophetic warning of future disobedience. The song encapsulates themes of God's faithfulness, Israel's rebellion, and the consequences of turning away from God. It serves as a covenant reminder, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commandments.<p><b>to all Israel</b><br>Moses addresses the entire nation of Israel, underscoring the communal aspect of the covenant. This collective address highlights the unity and shared responsibility of the people in upholding the covenant with God. The phrase "all Israel" signifies that the message is for every individual, from the leaders to the common people, reinforcing the idea that the covenant and its stipulations apply to everyone equally. This communal aspect is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, where the nation is often addressed as a single entity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.
