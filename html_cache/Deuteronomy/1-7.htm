It signifies a transition from a time of preparation and discipline to one of action and fulfillment of God's promises. The journey is not just physical but also spiritual, as it involves trusting in God's guidance and provision.<p><b>and go to the hill country of the Amorites;</b><br>The Amorites were a significant Canaanite tribe known for their fortified cities and military strength. The hill country refers to the central highlands of Canaan, a region of strategic importance. This command to go to the Amorites indicates God's intention for Israel to confront and overcome formidable adversaries, relying on His power rather than their own.<p><b>go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah,</b><br>The Arabah is a desert region stretching from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. It was a challenging terrain, symbolizing the trials and perseverance required of the Israelites. The mention of neighboring peoples highlights the diverse cultures and nations that Israel would encounter, each with its own customs and deities, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for Israel to demonstrate the supremacy of their God.<p><b>in the hill country,</b><br>This reiteration emphasizes the importance of the central highlands, a region that would later become the heartland of Israel. The hill country was known for its fertile land and strategic military advantage, making it a key area for settlement and control.<p><b>in the foothills,</b><br>The foothills, or Shephelah, are the lowlands between the coastal plain and the hill country. This area was agriculturally rich and often contested by various groups. It served as a buffer zone and was crucial for trade and defense, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the land God was giving to Israel.<p><b>in the Negev,</b><br>The Negev is a desert region in southern Israel. Its harsh conditions required resilience and adaptability, qualities that God was cultivating in His people. The Negev also served as a gateway to the southern trade routes, indicating the economic potential of the land.<p><b>and along the seacoast</b><br>The seacoast refers to the Mediterranean coastline, an area of significant economic and cultural exchange. Control of the seacoast would provide Israel with access to maritime trade and influence over coastal cities, which were often centers of wealth and power.<p><b>to the land of the Canaanites</b><br>The Canaanites were the primary inhabitants of the land promised to Israel. They were known for their advanced cities and idolatrous practices. God's command to go to the land of the Canaanites underscores the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham and the need for Israel to remain distinct and faithful amidst pagan influences.<p><b>and to Lebanon,</b><br>Lebanon, known for its cedar trees, was a region north of Israel. It represents the northernmost extent of the land God promised to the Israelites. The inclusion of Lebanon indicates the vastness of God's promise and the potential for Israel to influence a wide area.<p><b>as far as the great River Euphrates.</b><br>The Euphrates River, one of the longest rivers in Western Asia, marks the northeastern boundary of the promised land. This expansive promise reflects God's abundant provision and the potential for Israel to become a great nation. The mention of the Euphrates also connects to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised Abraham's descendants a vast territory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in the hill country, known for their strength and fortifications.

Each clause affirms that the Lord&#8217;s promises are concrete, geographical, and reliable. As Israel steps out, they will discover that every varied landscape is already under God&#8217;s claim and care.

The mountain range of the Amorites, afterwards called the hill country of Judah and Ephraim, was the object which would first strike the view of one advancing from the south; and so, it stands here for the whole land of Canaan, with which it is in this context identified. Those "that dwell thereon" are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan. The Amorites (Hebrew <span class="accented">Emori</span>, so called from Amor, or Emor) oftener than once appear as standing for the Canaanites generally (cf. <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20, 21</a>, etc.). That all the inhabitants of Canaan are intended here is evident from the specification of the different districts of the land of Canaan which immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>: the '<span class="accented">Arabah</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">In the hills</span>: the hill country of Judah (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>: the <span class="accented">shephelah</span>, or lowland, the country lying between the mountain range of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching northwards from the parallel of Gaza to that of Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">In the south</span>: the <span class="accented">negeb</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> southland (literally, <span class="accented">dryness</span>), the district which formed the transition from the desert to the cultivated land, extending from the south of the Dead Sea westwards to Gaza, a vast steppe or prairie, for the most part pasture land. The seashore: the narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean from <span class="accented">Joppa to</span> Tyre (in the New Testament, "the coast of Tyre and Sidon," <a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Canaanites</span>: the whole country of which these were the separate parts. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Lebanon</span>: the <span class="accented">Whale Mountain</span>, so called, probably, from the snow which rests on its summit. <span class="cmt_word">The great river, the river Euphrates</span>.
