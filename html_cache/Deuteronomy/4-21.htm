In <a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-12</a>, Moses disobeyed God by striking the rock to bring forth water instead of speaking to it, as God commanded. This act of disobedience was influenced by the people's constant complaints and rebellion, which tested Moses' patience. The anger of the LORD here is a reminder of the seriousness of leadership and obedience to God's commands. It also highlights the communal nature of sin and its consequences, as the actions of the people contributed to Moses' failure.<p><b>and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan</b><br>God's oath that Moses would not enter the Promised Land is a significant moment in Israel's history. The Jordan River represents a boundary between the wilderness and the land of Canaan, the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. Moses' inability to cross signifies the end of an era and the transition of leadership to Joshua. This also serves as a typology of the Law, represented by Moses, which cannot bring people into the ultimate rest and promise of God, a role fulfilled by Jesus Christ, the true Joshua (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<p><b>to enter the good land</b><br>The "good land" refers to Canaan, described as a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). It symbolizes God's provision and blessing, a place of abundance and rest. This land was promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and its goodness is a reflection of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant. The land also serves as a type of the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ, pointing to the ultimate "good land" of the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<p><b>that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is central to the biblical narrative, emphasizing God's grace and the unearned nature of His gifts. The land is not something the Israelites earned but is given by God as part of His covenant promise. This inheritance is a foretaste of the spiritual inheritance believers receive through faith in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>). It underscores the idea of divine election and the blessings that come from being God's chosen people. The inheritance also points to the rest and peace found in God's presence, both in the land of Canaan and ultimately in eternity with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
