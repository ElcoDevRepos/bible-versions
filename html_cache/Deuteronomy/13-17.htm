In the context of Deuteronomy, this is part of the instructions for dealing with cities that have turned to idol worship. The term "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: "herem") indicates something set apart for complete destruction as an offering to God. This reflects the seriousness of idolatry and the need for purity among God's people. The command to not let anything cling to their hands emphasizes the need for total separation from sin and idolatry, echoing the call for holiness found throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger</b><br>This phrase highlights the conditional nature of God's relationship with Israel. God's anger is described as "fierce," indicating the severity of His response to sin, particularly idolatry, which is seen as spiritual adultery. The turning away of God's anger is contingent upon Israel's obedience to His commands. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings and curses are dependent on Israel's faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28). The concept of God's anger turning away is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9-10</a>, where Nineveh's repentance leads to God relenting from disaster.<p><b>grant you mercy</b><br>Mercy is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's character as compassionate and forgiving. The granting of mercy here is contingent upon Israel's obedience and repentance. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's mercy is extended to those who turn back to Him (e.g., <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-13</a>). The Hebrew word for mercy, "racham," conveys deep compassion and love, akin to a parent's love for a child. This promise of mercy underscores the hope of restoration and forgiveness.<p><b>show you compassion</b><br>Compassion, closely related to mercy, emphasizes God's tender care and concern for His people. The promise of compassion is a reassurance of God's willingness to restore and bless His people despite their failures. This reflects the nature of God as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." The call to show compassion is also a model for how God's people are to treat others, as seen in the teachings of Jesus (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p><b>and multiply you as He swore to your fathers</b><br>This phrase connects to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to multiply Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 15</a>:5). The multiplication of Israel is both a literal promise of numerous descendants and a metaphor for blessing and prosperity. This promise is contingent upon Israel's faithfulness to God, reflecting the covenantal theme of blessings for obedience. The fulfillment of this promise is seen in the growth of Israel as a nation and is ultimately fulfilled in the spiritual descendants of Abraham through faith in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the laws and commandments as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/devoted_to_destruction.htm">Devoted to Destruction</a></b><br>Refers to items or people that are to be completely destroyed as an act of devotion to God, often related to idolatry or pagan practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is delivering these commands through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/complete_obedience.htm">Complete Obedience</a></b><br>God requires complete obedience to His commands, especially regarding idolatry and sin.

Similar warnings appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a> and in <a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where Achan&#8217;s hidden loot brought judgment on the whole nation.<p>- The lesson is clear: any object, habit, or allegiance tied to idolatry or rebellion must be fully removed, never tucked away &#8220;just in case.&#8221; Half-measures invite spiritual contamination (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>).<p>- For believers today, this means ruthlessly discarding whatever fuels sin&#8212;whether media, relationships, or secret practices&#8212;so that nothing &#8220;devoted to destruction&#8221; remains within reach (<a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger</b><p>- God&#8217;s anger is not capricious; it is the outworking of His holy character against sin (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>).<p>- When Israel obeyed and destroyed the idolatrous city, it created space for the LORD &#8220;to turn from His fierce anger.&#8221; Comparable moments are found in <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>, <a href="/psalms/85-3.htm">Psalm 85:3</a>, and <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, where God&#8217;s wrath subsides after genuine repentance and decisive action.<p>- The principle endures: confession coupled with concrete repentance averts discipline and restores fellowship (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>grant you mercy</b><p>- Mercy means God withholds the judgment we rightfully deserve. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-31.htm">Deuteronomy 4:31</a> affirms, &#8220;For the LORD your God is a merciful God.&#8221;<p>- Removing the devoted things positioned Israel to receive mercy rather than ongoing chastisement.<p>- In Christ, this mercy is fully realized: &#8220;He saved us, not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>- Practical reminder: we cannot cling to sin and simultaneously expect to enjoy the sweetness of divine mercy (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>show you compassion</b><p>- Compassion goes beyond withholding punishment; it expresses tenderhearted care. <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a> pictures the LORD&#8217;s fatherly pity on His children.<p>- After judgment is satisfied, God draws near with comforting kindness&#8212;seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>.<p>- For the believer, this compassion is felt through the indwelling Spirit who assures us of adoption (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-16</a>) and through the body of Christ as we &#8220;carry one another&#8217;s burdens&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and multiply you as He swore to your fathers</b><p>- The final phrase ties obedience to covenant blessing: fruitfulness and growth.
