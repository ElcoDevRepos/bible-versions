In the broader context of Deuteronomy, this confession comes after the Israelites initially refused to enter the Promised Land due to fear, despite God's assurance of victory (<a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). Their admission of sin is a crucial step in the biblical theme of repentance, which is necessary for restoration with God. This mirrors the pattern seen throughout Scripture, where confession precedes divine forgiveness and restoration (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God has commanded us.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the Israelites express a desire to obey God's original command to take possession of the land. However, this decision comes after God has already decreed that they would wander in the wilderness for 40 years due to their initial lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26-35</a>). This highlights a key biblical principle: delayed obedience is often disobedience. The Israelites' attempt to fight now is not in alignment with God's current directive, illustrating the importance of timely obedience to God's will. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>), as their actions lacked the faith and timing God required.<p><b>Then each of you put on his weapons of war,</b><br>The Israelites' preparation for battle signifies their reliance on human strength rather than divine guidance. This act of arming themselves contrasts with previous victories where God fought on their behalf, such as the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The emphasis on physical weapons underscores a recurring biblical theme: true victory comes from reliance on God, not human might (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). This also serves as a type of Christ, who would later teach that His kingdom is not of this world and does not rely on earthly weapons (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<p><b>thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</b><br>The Israelites' assumption that the battle would be easy reveals their misunderstanding of the situation and underestimation of the enemy. This reflects a broader biblical warning against pride and self-reliance (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The hill country, likely referring to the rugged terrain of Canaan, was strategically challenging, and their presumption led to their defeat (<a href="/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44-45</a>). This serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking God's guidance and understanding the spiritual battles believers face, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.

Yet context shows it came only after God&#8217;s judgment was pronounced (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-34.htm">Deuteronomy 1:34-35</a>). Like Pharaoh&#8217;s &#8220;I have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>), the admission was born of regret over consequences, not a heart changed toward God (<a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>).

The people were reacting to bad news rather than responding in faith.

Obedience is not clinging to yesterday&#8217;s command while rejecting today&#8217;s (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).

By arming themselves they appeared ready, yet spiritual readiness was absent (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-11</a>).

Their defeat by the Amorites proved that any task is impossible when God is not leading (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a> exposes a pattern: late confession, lip-service obedience, self-reliance, and careless optimism. The verse warns that true repentance must be timely and heartfelt, obedience must align with God&#8217;s current word, and victory is possible only when He is present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">We have sinned . . . we will go up and fight.</span>--The emphatic <span class= "ital">we </span>of this verse may be compared with the "we" of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm" title="Where shall we go up? our brothers have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>. In both instances it was <span class= "ital">we, </span>without <span class= "ital">Jehovah. </span>It was a change from cowardice to presumption, not from unbelief to faith.<p><span class= "bld">Ye were ready to go up into the hill.</span>--Some render, Ye <span class= "ital">made light of </span>going up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41-46.</span> - The people, appalled at the prospect of another sojourn in the wilderness, yet still rebellious and disobedient to God's command, though professing penitence, determined, in spite of direct prohibition on the part of God by Moses, to go up and force their way into Canaan; but were punished for their presumption by being utterly defeated and put to flight by the Amorites (comp. <a href="/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40-45</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have sinned</span>; in Numbers it is simply said that "the people mourned greatly" (bemoaned themselves, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>); but this is not incompatible with the statement here that they confessed their sins; the one would naturally accompany the ether. Their confession, however, was in word only; their conduct showed that it was not sincere. In Numbers (Numbers 14:44) it is said, "They presumed to go up;" here it is said (ver. Numbers 14:41), <span class="cmt_word">Ye were ready to go up</span>, rather, <span class="accented">ye acted heedlessly with levity</span>, or <span class="accented">rive</span>. <span class="accented">lonely</span>, <span class="accented">to go up</span>.

The Rabbins compare it with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>, lo we! here we be! of the people in <a href="/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40</a>. It is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, which is supposed to be the same as the Arabic , to be light, easy; and from, this the meaning, "ye went up heedlessly, is deduced. None of the ancient versions, however, give this meaning. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;
