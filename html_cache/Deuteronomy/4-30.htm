Historically, Israel experienced distress during periods of exile and oppression, such as the Babylonian captivity. Theologically, distress is often seen as a consequence of turning away from God, serving as a call to repentance.<p><b>and all these things have happened to you</b><br>This refers to the curses and consequences outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which would befall Israel if they failed to keep the covenant. These included defeat by enemies, famine, and exile. The historical fulfillment of these warnings can be seen in the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. This serves as a reminder of the seriousness of covenant faithfulness.<p><b>then in later days</b><br>The phrase "later days" often points to a future time of restoration and hope. In prophetic literature, it can refer to the eschatological future when God will restore His people. This can be connected to the Messianic hope and the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who brings about the new covenant.<p><b>you will return to the LORD your God</b><br>This indicates repentance and a turning back to God. The concept of returning is central to the biblical theme of repentance, where the people acknowledge their sins and seek God's forgiveness. This is echoed in the prophetic calls to return to God found in books like Hosea and Joel.<p><b>and listen to His voice</b><br>Listening to God's voice implies obedience and submission to His will. In the biblical context, hearing God's voice is associated with receiving His commandments and guidance. This is reminiscent of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls Israel to hear and obey. In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes the importance of hearing and following His teachings, as seen in <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>, where His followers are described as His sheep who listen to His voice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Moses is addressing the Israelites, reminding them of their covenant with God and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' message, they are God's chosen people who are about to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises to be with His people if they return to Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/distress.htm">Distress</a></b><br>Refers to the hardships and trials that the Israelites will face as a result of their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/later_days.htm">Later Days</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to future times when the Israelites will experience distress and have the opportunity to return to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_return.htm">The Call to Return</a></b><br>God&#8217;s invitation to return is always open, no matter how far we have strayed.

This, however, may include the far distant future, and so points to the time when Israel shall finally return to the Lord and be saved, through the acknowledgment of him whom they despised and rejected when he came as the Messiah promised to the fathers. As St. Paul grounds the assurance of the final redemption of Israel, as a whole, on their calling of God (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-29</a>), so Moses here sees in God's covenant the ground of the ever-watchful care and grace of God to Israel, and the security of their final restoration as a nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When you are in distress</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
