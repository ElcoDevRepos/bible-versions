This highlights the familial relationship between the Israelites and Edomites, rooted in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where God tells Rebekah about the two nations in her womb. The Edomites, living in Seir, were not to be harassed or provoked, as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>, because God had given them their land. This reflects God's sovereignty in allotting lands to different peoples and His respect for the covenant with Abraham's descendants, including Esau.<p><b>We turned away from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber,</b><br>The Arabah is a desert region extending from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Elath and Ezion-geber were significant port cities at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, known for trade and commerce. This route was a major trade artery, indicating the Israelites' strategic movement to avoid conflict with Edom. The decision to turn away from this road underscores the importance of obedience to God's command to avoid confrontation with Edom, as well as the practical need to navigate through less hostile territories.<p><b>and traveled along the road of the Wilderness of Moab.</b><br>The Wilderness of Moab refers to the region east of the Dead Sea, inhabited by the Moabites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). The Israelites' journey through this area was part of their broader movement towards the Promised Land. Moab, like Edom, was not to be attacked, as God had given this land to the descendants of Lot. This passage highlights the Israelites' reliance on God's guidance and the fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs. The journey through Moab also sets the stage for future interactions with the Moabites, including the story of Balaam and the eventual conquest of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_esau.htm">Descendants of Esau</a></b><br>The Edomites, who are the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother.
