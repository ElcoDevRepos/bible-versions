It is a direct address to the nation of Israel, highlighting their identity as God's chosen people. The phrase "Hear now" is a common biblical exhortation, urging the audience to listen and obey. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, which begins with "Hear, O Israel," underscoring the importance of listening to God's commands.<p><b>the statutes and ordinances</b><br>These terms refer to the laws and decrees given by God. "Statutes" often denote permanent laws, while "ordinances" can refer to specific regulations or judgments. This legal framework was intended to set Israel apart as a holy nation. The giving of the law is a central theme in the Pentateuch, with the Ten Commandments as a foundational element (Exodus 20).<p><b>I am teaching you to follow</b><br>Moses, as the mediator of God's law, is instructing the Israelites. This teaching role is significant, as it underscores the importance of passing down God's commandments through generations. The emphasis on teaching aligns with the biblical mandate for parents to instruct their children in the ways of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>).<p><b>so that you may live</b><br>Obedience to God's laws is linked to life and prosperity. This promise of life is both physical and spiritual, suggesting that adherence to God's commandments leads to a flourishing existence. This concept is reiterated in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where choosing life is equated with loving and obeying God.<p><b>and may enter and take possession of the land</b><br>The land promise is a central theme in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The land of Canaan is portrayed as a gift from God, contingent upon Israel's obedience. This phrase underscores the conditional nature of the covenant, where possession of the land is tied to faithfulness to God's commands.<p><b>that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you</b><br>This phrase connects the present generation of Israelites to their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reaffirming the continuity of God's promises. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes God's covenantal faithfulness. The land is described as a divine gift, highlighting God's sovereignty and grace. This promise is fulfilled in the conquest narratives of Joshua, where the Israelites take possession of the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commandments and statutes to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are about to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the forefathers of Israel as an inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is giving the land to His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/statutes_and_ordinances.htm">Statutes and Ordinances</a></b><br>The laws and commandments given by God through Moses for the people to follow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening.htm">The Importance of Listening</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "listen" (shama) implies not just hearing but obeying.

Moses, having presented to the people certain facts in their recent history which had in them a specially animating and encouraging tendency, proceeds to direct his discourse to the inculcation of duties and exhortations to obedience to the Divine enactments. This portion also of his address is of an introductory character as well as what precedes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation to the observance of the Law generally</span>. The Law was to be kept as a complete whole; nothing was to be taken from it or added to it; it comprised the commandments of Jehovah, and therefore they were not only to do it as what Moses, their leader and lawgiver, had enjoined, but to keep it as a sacred deposit, not to be altered or tampered with, and to observe it as what God their Sovereign had enacted for them. The dignity and worth of the Law are here asserted, and also its completeness as given by Moses. Any addition to it, no less than any subtraction from it, would mar its integrity and affect its perfection. Altered circumstances in process of time might, indeed, lead to the desuetude of some parts of the Mosaic enactments, and new institutions or laws might be required to meet a new condition of things, or even in that new condition to fence and sustain the primitive code; but that cede was to remain intact in the Statute-Book, and no alterations were to be made upon it that should affect its substance or nullify any of its principles. New laws and institutions appointed by God would, of course, have the same authority as those originally ordained by Moses; and such, it can hardly be doubted, were in point of fact under the Hebrew monarchy introduced by the prophets speaking in the name of God. The Law, nevertheless, was kept substantially entire. Even under the new dispensation, the Law has not been abolished. Christ, as he himself declared, came not to destroy the Law and the prophets, but to fulfill them (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The sin of the Pharisees, for which they were censured by our Lord, lay in this, that they taught for doctrines the commandments of men (<a href="/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>), and had "made the commandments of God of none effect by their traditions" (<a href="/matthew/15-6.htm">Matthew 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span>; rather <span class="accented">And now</span>. With this Moses passes from referring to what God had done for Israel to admonish Israel as to what they had to do as the subjects of God and the recipients of his favor. They were to give heed to all the statutes and judgments which Moses, as the servant of God, had taught them, in order that they might do them. <span class="cmt_word">Statutes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), the things prescribed or enacted by law, whether moral, ritual, or civil; <span class="cmt_word">judgments</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), <span class="accented">rights</span>, whether public or private, all that each could claim as his due, and all he was bound to render to God or to his fellow-men as their due. These two comprehend the whole Law as binding on Israel. On the doing of these by the people depended <span class="accented">life</span>; these had been made known to them, not merely for their information, but specifically that they might do them, and thereby have life; not long life in the Promised Land alone, though this also is included (ver. 40; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>, etc.), but that higher life, that life which man lives "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord" (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>), that spiritual life which is in God's favor (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).
