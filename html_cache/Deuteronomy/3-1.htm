Bashan was a fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its rich pastures and strong cities. The Israelites' journey to Bashan signifies their continued conquest of the Promised Land. This movement is part of God's directive to take possession of the land He promised to their ancestors. The road to Bashan would have been a well-traveled route, indicating strategic military planning.<p><b>and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet us in battle at Edrei</b><br>Og, the king of Bashan, is a significant figure due to his reputation as one of the last of the Rephaim, a race of giants. His coming out to battle with his entire army shows the seriousness of the threat he posed. Edrei was one of the major cities of Bashan, strategically located and fortified. The confrontation at Edrei highlights the Israelites' reliance on God's promise and power, as they faced formidable opponents. This battle is a continuation of the theme of divine assistance in overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles, as seen in previous victories over Sihon, king of the Amorites.
