In the context of Deuteronomy, the Israelites are reminded of their unique relationship with God. Holiness involves both moral purity and a distinct identity. The Israelites were to reflect God's character and live according to His commandments. This idea of being set apart is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The holiness of the Israelites also foreshadows the holiness of the Church, the body of Christ, which is called to be distinct from the world.<p><b>The LORD has chosen you</b><br>The concept of divine election is central here. God's choice of Israel was not based on their merit but on His sovereign will and love (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). This election is a theme throughout the Bible, seen in God's choice of individuals like Abraham and David, and later in the New Testament with the election of believers (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>). This choice underscores God's initiative in establishing a covenant relationship with His people, highlighting His grace and purpose.<p><b>to be a people for His prized possession</b><br>This phrase indicates a special relationship between God and Israel, where they are considered His treasured possession. This is reminiscent of <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God calls Israel a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The term "prized possession" suggests value and care, indicating that God holds His people in high regard. This relationship is not just about privilege but also responsibility, as Israel is to live in a way that honors God. In the New Testament, believers are described as God's possession, called to declare His praises (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.</b><br>This highlights the universal scope of God's sovereignty and His specific choice of Israel among all nations. It underscores the uniqueness of Israel's calling and mission. While God is the Creator of all, He chose Israel to be the vehicle through which He would reveal Himself to the world. This selection is part of the unfolding plan of redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings salvation to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The phrase also points to the future gathering of all peoples under Christ's lordship, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation worships before the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, set apart to be holy and distinct from other nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who has chosen Israel as His special possession.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land given to the Israelites, where they are to live out their calling as a holy nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who delivers God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, establishing them as His people and outlining their responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_as_a_calling.htm">Holiness as a Calling</a></b><br>As God's chosen people, we are called to live lives that reflect His holiness.

In the former passage, the principle is made the ground for destroying all monuments of idolatry in the land of Israel. Here it is made the basis of outward personal dignity and purity.
