The desert land represents the physical wilderness where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after the Exodus from Egypt. It also symbolizes spiritual barrenness and the need for divine intervention. The desert is often a place of testing and transformation in the Bible, as seen in the experiences of Moses, Elijah, and Jesus. This setting underscores God's initiative in seeking out His people when they were lost and vulnerable.<p><b>in a barren, howling wilderness</b><br>The wilderness is described as barren and howling, emphasizing its harsh and inhospitable nature. This reflects the Israelites' physical and spiritual challenges during their journey. The wilderness is a place of danger and desolation, yet it is also where God reveals His power and provision. The "howling" suggests the presence of wild animals and the absence of human civilization, highlighting the miraculous nature of God's protection and guidance. This imagery connects to other biblical accounts of wilderness experiences, such as Hagar's encounter with God in the desert (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-14</a>).<p><b>He surrounded him</b><br>God's surrounding of Israel indicates His protective presence. This imagery suggests a divine encampment, where God Himself acts as a shield against external threats. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where He promises to be their God and protector. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>, where the Lord surrounds His people as the mountains surround Jerusalem. It also prefigures the protective role of Christ, who surrounds believers with His love and grace.<p><b>He instructed him</b><br>God's instruction of Israel in the wilderness involved giving them the Law and teaching them His ways. This instruction was not only about legal statutes but also about forming a people who would reflect His character and holiness. The wilderness served as a classroom where Israel learned dependence on God and obedience to His commands. This instruction is foundational to the covenant relationship and is reiterated throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are commanded to teach God's laws to their children.<p><b>He guarded him as the apple of His eye</b><br>The phrase "apple of His eye" is a metaphor for something precious and highly valued. It indicates the special care and attention God gives to Israel, treating them as a cherished possession. This expression is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a> and <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>, to convey God's protective love for His people. It highlights the intimate and personal nature of God's relationship with Israel, foreshadowing the New Testament revelation of God's love for the Church through Christ. The imagery of the eye suggests vigilance and constant watchfulness, assuring believers of God's unwavering care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the protector and guide.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Represented by "him," referring to the nation of Israel whom God found and cared for.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/desert_land.htm">Desert Land</a></b><br>Symbolizes the challenging and desolate conditions from which God rescued Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>Represents the trials and tribulations faced by Israel, both physically and spiritually.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/apple_of_his_eye.htm">Apple of His Eye</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's deep care and protection over Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_desolation.htm">God's Faithfulness in Desolation</a></b><br>Even in the most barren and challenging circumstances, God remains faithful and present.

By Delitzsch and others this explanation of the word is rejected as not philologically justified, there being no evidence that the termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> had a diminutive force; and as not in keeping with the earnestness of the passages in which this word occurs. They prefer the explanation <span class="accented">man image</span> to <span class="accented">mannikin</span>. Anyhow, the use of the word here must be taken as indicating that Israel is ever in the eye of the Lord, the object of his constant and tenderest care. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He found him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
