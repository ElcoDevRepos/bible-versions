The priesthood was established through Aaron, the brother of Moses, and his descendants (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The priest serving "at that time" suggests the continuity and succession of the priestly office, which was essential for maintaining the religious and ceremonial life of Israel. The priest's role was to receive offerings and declarations from the people, acting as a representative of God. This reflects the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>and say to him</b><br>The act of speaking to the priest underscores the personal responsibility of each Israelite to acknowledge God's provision and faithfulness. This verbal declaration was a public acknowledgment of God's promises and their fulfillment. It was not merely a ritual but a heartfelt expression of gratitude and recognition of God's sovereignty. This practice emphasizes the importance of confession and testimony in the life of faith, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>, where confession is linked to salvation.<p><b>&#8220;I declare today to the LORD your God</b><br>The declaration is made "to the LORD your God," highlighting the personal relationship between the Israelites and Yahweh. The use of "your God" signifies the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God chose Israel as His people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This declaration is an act of worship and acknowledgment of God's lordship and faithfulness. It is a reminder of the covenant promises and the Israelites' identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>that I have entered the land</b><br>Entering the land represents the fulfillment of God's promise to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This phrase signifies the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the possession of the Promised Land, a central theme in the Pentateuch. The land was a tangible sign of God's faithfulness and a place where Israel was to live out its covenant relationship with God. This entry into the land is a type of the believer's entry into the spiritual rest and inheritance found in Christ, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>.<p><b>that the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase recalls the covenant promises made to the patriarchs, beginning with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, where God promised to give his descendants the land of Canaan. The fulfillment of this promise is a testament to God's faithfulness and the reliability of His word. It also serves as a reminder of the continuity of God's plan throughout generations. The land is not just a physical inheritance but a symbol of God's enduring covenant and the blessings associated with obedience and faithfulness to Him. This promise and its fulfillment foreshadow the ultimate promise of eternal life and the new creation in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The religious leader serving at the time, representing the people before God and facilitating their worship and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promised the land to the forefathers of the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>The Promised Land, Canaan, which God swore to give to the ancestors of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_forefathers.htm">The Forefathers</a></b><br>The patriarchs of Israel, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom God made the promise of the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are entering and taking possession of the land promised to their ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_god's_faithfulness.htm">Acknowledgment of God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The declaration to the priest is an acknowledgment of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.
