This directive reflects the decentralized nature of Israelite governance, where each tribe had a degree of autonomy. The role of judges was not only judicial but also spiritual, as they were expected to uphold God's laws. This system can be seen as a precursor to the later establishment of the monarchy, where centralized authority became more pronounced. The appointment of judges is reminiscent of Moses' earlier actions in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>, where he appointed leaders to help him judge the people, following the advice of his father-in-law Jethro.<p><b>in every town that the LORD your God is giving you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the Israelites' land and their settlements. The towns were not just places of residence but were seen as gifts from God, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The distribution of judges in every town ensured that justice was accessible to all, reflecting God's concern for equity and fairness. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that God is the ultimate giver of all good things (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><b>They are to judge the people with righteous judgment</b><br>Righteous judgment is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's own nature as just and fair. The judges were to embody these divine attributes, ensuring that their decisions were impartial and based on God's laws. This requirement for righteousness is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for justice, mercy, and humility. The call for righteous judgment also points to the ultimate Judge, Jesus Christ, who will judge the world with perfect justice (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Individuals appointed to administer justice and make legal decisions for the people of Israel.

Whilst the people were in the wilderness, united as one body and under the leadership of Moses, this arrangement was sufficient; but a more extended arrangement would be required when they came to be settled in Canaan and dispersed in towns and villages over the whole land. In prospect of this, Moses here enacts that judges and officers were to be appointed by the people in all their gates, in all their places of residence, which the Lord should give them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judges and officers.</span> The "officers" (<span class="accented">shoterim</span>, writers) associated with the judges both in the earlier arrangements and in that which was to succeed were secretaries and clerks of court, and acted also as assessors and advisers of the judges. No instruction is given as to the number of judges and officers, or as to the mode of appointing them; nor was this necessary. The former would be determined by the size and population of the place where they were appointed, and the latter would, as a matter of course, follow the method instituted by Moses in the earlier arrangement (see <a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13-15</a>;
