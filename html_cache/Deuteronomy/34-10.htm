It highlights the unique role Moses played in Israel's history. Moses' leadership and prophetic ministry were unparalleled, setting a standard for future prophets. The phrase underscores the transition from Moses' direct leadership to the era of the judges and later prophets.<p><b>no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses</b><br>Moses is distinguished as the greatest prophet in Israel's history. His role as a mediator between God and the Israelites was unique, as he delivered the Law and led the people out of Egypt. This statement emphasizes the singularity of Moses' prophetic office, which included performing miracles, receiving the Law, and interceding for the people. It also sets a benchmark for future prophets, who, while significant, did not match Moses' direct communication with God and leadership.<p><b>whom the LORD knew face to face&#8212;</b><br>This phrase indicates the intimate relationship between Moses and God. Unlike other prophets who received visions or dreams, Moses spoke with God directly and personally, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>. This face-to-face interaction signifies a level of closeness and clarity in communication that was exceptional. It prefigures the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who is described as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, having an even more profound relationship with the Father (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>).

The statement in this verse could only have been inserted some time after the death of Moses, and after the people had had manifestations of God's presence with them, both by communications from him through the prophets and by the successes which he had given them over their enemies. But it is not necessary to suppose that a long period during which a lengthened succession of prophets had arisen had elapsed.
