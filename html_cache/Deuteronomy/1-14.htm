It highlights the communal decision-making process among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The context is Moses recounting the events at Horeb, where he suggested appointing leaders to help him judge the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9-13</a>). This response indicates a collective agreement, showing the unity and willingness of the people to follow Moses' leadership. It also underscores the importance of communication and agreement in leadership and governance, a principle seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>, where the early church chose deacons to assist the apostles.<p><b>&#8220;What you propose to do is good.&#8221;</b><br>The Israelites' affirmation of Moses' plan demonstrates their trust in his leadership and wisdom. The proposal involved appointing wise, understanding, and respected men as leaders over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, to help manage the people's disputes and daily affairs. This system of delegation is a practical application of Jethro's advice to Moses in <a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-23</a>, where Jethro suggested a similar structure to prevent Moses from becoming overwhelmed. The phrase also reflects a biblical principle of shared leadership and the distribution of responsibilities, which is echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, where Paul discusses the diversity of gifts and roles within the body of Christ. This system not only provided practical governance but also foreshadowed the establishment of organized leadership within the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting the events of their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.

The very first words of verse 14 emphasize that the people responded&#8212; they did not remain silent or indifferent.<p>- Their willingness to give an answer reflects the pattern seen at Sinai: &#8220;And all the people answered together and said, &#8216;All that the LORD has spoken we will do&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>).<p>- A responsive heart toward godly leadership is commended elsewhere: &#8220;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>- The verse highlights spoken agreement. Scripture often links the mouth to the heart&#8217;s posture: &#8220;A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>).<p>- By articulating their consent, the Israelites committed themselves publicly, echoing Joshua&#8217;s generation: &#8220;They answered Joshua, &#8216;All that you have commanded us we will do&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-16.htm">Joshua 1:16-17</a>).<p>- Words matter; Jesus affirmed, &#8220;For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What you propose to do</b><p>- Moses&#8217; proposal was not a personal whim; it flowed from God-given wisdom first modeled by Jethro&#8217;s counsel to Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-23</a>).<p>- Delegating qualified leaders safeguards the community, much like the apostles&#8217; plan to appoint seven men for service so the word of God would spread (<a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2-5</a>).<p>- Scripture praises seeking counsel: &#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is good</b><p>- Declaring the plan &#8220;good&#8221; shows discernment that aligns with God&#8217;s character: &#8220;He has shown you, O man, what is good&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>- Goodness here means beneficial, pleasing to God, and advantageous for the people. The New Testament echoes this evaluative lens: &#8220;Test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p>- Wisdom from above &#8220;is first of all pure, then peaceable&#8230; full of mercy and good fruit&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>); the people recognized those qualities in Moses&#8217; plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/1-14.htm">Deuteronomy 1:14</a> records Israel&#8217;s verbal, wholehearted agreement with Moses&#8217; Spirit-led proposal to appoint capable leaders.
