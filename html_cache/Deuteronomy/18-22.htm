Speaking "in the name of the LORD" implies a claim of divine authority. The role of a prophet was crucial, as they were seen as intermediaries between God and His people. This phrase underscores the seriousness of claiming to speak for God, as it involves invoking His holy name.<p><b>and the message does not come to pass or come true</b><br>The fulfillment of a prophecy was a key test of its authenticity. In the biblical context, a true prophet's words would align with God's will and come to fruition. This criterion is rooted in the understanding that God is sovereign and His plans are infallible. Historical examples include the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, whose messages were validated by their eventual fulfillment.<p><b>that is a message the LORD has not spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the distinction between true and false prophecy. If a prophecy fails, it indicates that it was not from God. This serves as a safeguard for the community, protecting them from deception. The Bible warns against false prophets in several passages, such as <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-18</a>, where God denounces those who speak visions from their own minds.<p><b>The prophet has spoken presumptuously</b><br>Presumption in this context refers to arrogance or overstepping one's bounds. A presumptuous prophet acts without divine commission, relying on personal ambition or deceit. This behavior is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2-3</a>, where false prophets are criticized for following their own spirit rather than God's.<p><b>Do not be afraid of him</b><br>This instruction reassures the people that they need not fear false prophets. In a culture where prophetic words could influence national decisions and personal lives, distinguishing true from false prophecy was vital. The command to not fear aligns with the broader biblical theme of trusting in God's protection and guidance, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to speak on behalf of God, delivering messages and prophecies to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who communicates His will and messages through true prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving guidance and laws to live by as they prepare to enter Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that the Israelites are about to enter, where they will encounter various challenges and false prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_prophecy.htm">Discernment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment when evaluating prophetic messages, ensuring they align with God's Word and come to pass.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_god's_word.htm">Authority of God's Word</a></b><br>The ultimate authority for truth is God's Word.
