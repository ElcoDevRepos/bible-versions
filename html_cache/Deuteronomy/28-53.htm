It refers to the extreme conditions that would arise during a siege, where food becomes so scarce that people resort to cannibalism. This is not merely a hyperbolic statement but a prophetic warning that was fulfilled during the sieges of Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28-29</a>) and Jerusalem (<a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>). The phrase underscores the severity of turning away from God and the resulting judgment.<p><b>the flesh of the sons and daughters</b><br>The mention of "sons and daughters" highlights the personal and familial devastation that would occur. In ancient Near Eastern culture, children were considered a blessing and a sign of God's favor. The reversal of this blessing into a curse serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of breaking the covenant. This imagery is meant to shock the audience into understanding the gravity of their potential disobedience.<p><b>whom the LORD your God has given you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that children are a gift from God, reinforcing the tragedy of the situation. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the blessings He bestows upon His people. The loss and consumption of these blessings due to disobedience highlight the seriousness of the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>in the siege and distress</b><br>The context of a siege is historically significant, as sieges were common in ancient warfare. They involved surrounding a city to cut off supplies, leading to starvation and desperation. The distress mentioned here is both physical and psychological, illustrating the totality of suffering that results from divine judgment. This phrase connects to other biblical accounts of sieges, such as those found in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/52.htm">Jeremiah 52</a>.<p><b>that your enemy will inflict on you</b><br>This part of the verse identifies the source of the suffering as the enemy, which God allows as a form of judgment. It reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God warns that disobedience will lead to foreign nations overpowering Israel. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of forsaking God's protection and the reality of living in a fallen world where enemies can prevail when God&#8217;s favor is withdrawn.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and warnings to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the blessings and curses based on their obedience or disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who sets forth blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_israel.htm">Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>Nations that would besiege and distress Israel as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege.htm">Siege</a></b><br>A military blockade and assault on a city, leading to extreme conditions such as famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's warnings are not to be taken lightly.
