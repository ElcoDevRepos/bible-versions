Their involvement underscores the communal responsibility for addressing sin and maintaining purity within the land. The city nearest the victim is held accountable, emphasizing the importance of community in God's covenant with Israel. This reflects the principle of collective responsibility seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>shall take a heifer</b><br>The heifer, a young female cow, is significant in biblical rituals. It symbolizes innocence and purity, as it has not yet been used for labor or sacrifice. The use of a heifer in this context is a form of atonement for the unsolved murder, highlighting the seriousness of bloodshed and the need for purification. This ritual is unique to Deuteronomy and reflects the broader sacrificial system established in Leviticus.<p><b>that has never been yoked or used for work</b><br>The requirement that the heifer has never been yoked or used for work signifies its purity and suitability for a sacred purpose. In biblical terms, an animal that has not been used for common labor is considered unblemished and thus appropriate for sacrifice. This mirrors the requirement for sacrificial animals in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>, which must be without defect. The unyoked heifer can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was without sin and bore the burden of humanity's sins, offering Himself as the ultimate sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_city.htm">Elders of the City</a></b><br>These are the leaders or senior figures in the nearest city to where the victim is found.
