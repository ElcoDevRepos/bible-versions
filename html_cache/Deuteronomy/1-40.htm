God commands them to turn back, signifying a divine judgment and a consequence of their disobedience. This turning back is a physical and spiritual retreat, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's commands. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of unbelief, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>, where unbelief prevents entry into God's rest.<p><b>and head for the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of testing and purification. For the Israelites, it was a place where they would wander for 40 years, a year for each day the spies spent scouting the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>). This period was meant to humble and test them, as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>. The wilderness journey is symbolic of the Christian life, where believers are refined and learn dependence on God.<p><b>along the route to the Red Sea.</b><br>The Red Sea, or Yam Suph, is significant as the site of the miraculous crossing where God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian bondage (Exodus 14). This reference serves as a reminder of God's past deliverance and faithfulness, even as the Israelites face the consequences of their current disobedience. The route to the Red Sea symbolizes a return to the starting point of their journey, emphasizing the cyclical nature of disobedience and the need for repentance. The Red Sea crossing is also a type of baptism, representing the believer's passage from death to life through Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting God's instructions to the people after their refusal to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were delivered from Egypt and are now wandering in the wilderness due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites were to wander as a consequence of their lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/red_sea.htm">Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites crossed during the Exodus, symbolizing God's deliverance and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh-barnea.htm">Kadesh-barnea</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites initially refused to enter the Promised Land, leading to their punishment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God&#8217;s Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to obey God resulted in a significant detour in their journey.
