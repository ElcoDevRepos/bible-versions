This transition of leadership is significant, as Joshua has been Moses' aide and military leader. The calling signifies a public endorsement and transfer of authority, ensuring continuity in leadership. Joshua's role is crucial as he is to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, a task Moses was not permitted to complete due to his disobedience at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).<p><b>and said to him in the presence of all Israel</b><br>This public declaration serves to affirm Joshua's leadership in front of the entire nation, ensuring that the people recognize and accept him as their new leader. It also emphasizes the transparency and accountability in the transition of power. The presence of all Israel underscores the communal aspect of their journey and covenant with God, reinforcing the unity and collective responsibility of the people.<p><b>Be strong and courageous</b><br>This exhortation is a recurring theme in the commissioning of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a>). Strength and courage are essential qualities for Joshua as he faces the daunting task of leading the Israelites into a land filled with formidable enemies. This phrase also reflects a reliance on God's power and presence, rather than mere human strength. It is a call to faith and trust in God's promises and guidance.<p><b>for you will go with this people into the land</b><br>Joshua's mission is to lead the Israelites into Canaan, the land promised to their ancestors. This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The journey into the land is both a physical and spiritual endeavor, requiring obedience and faithfulness to God's commands. Joshua's leadership is pivotal in guiding the people through this transition.<p><b>that the LORD swore to their fathers to give them</b><br>This reference to God's oath underscores the faithfulness and unchanging nature of God's promises. The land is not just a geographical location but a symbol of God's covenantal relationship with Israel. The promise to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18) is now coming to fruition, demonstrating God's sovereignty and commitment to His people.<p><b>and you shall give it to them as an inheritance</b><br>Joshua's role is not only to lead the people into the land but also to allocate it among the tribes of Israel as their inheritance. This distribution is a fulfillment of God's promise and a tangible expression of His provision and blessing. The concept of inheritance is significant, as it ties the people to the land and to their identity as God's chosen nation. It also foreshadows the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who brought them out of Egypt and guided them through the wilderness.
