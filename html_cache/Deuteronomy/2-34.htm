The Israelites are recounting their journey and conquests as they approach the Promised Land. This period is during the wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt, a time of divine guidance and preparation for entering Canaan.<p><b>we captured all his cities</b><br>The "his" refers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, whose territory the Israelites were commanded to take. This conquest is part of the broader narrative of Israel's divinely sanctioned military campaigns. The capture of cities signifies God's fulfillment of His promise to give Israel the land of Canaan.<p><b>and devoted to destruction the people of every city</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: herem) indicates a complete consecration to God, often through destruction. This was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern warfare, where conquered peoples and their possessions were dedicated to a deity. For Israel, it was a means of purging idolatry and sin from the land.<p><b>including women and children</b><br>This difficult phrase reflects the totality of the herem command. It underscores the severity of God's judgment against the Amorites, who were seen as irredeemably corrupt. This action is often discussed in theological terms as a divine judgment rather than a human act of war.<p><b>We left no survivors</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the completeness of the destruction. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. Theologically, it points to the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as seen in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, who are journeying towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The Amorite king of Heshbon, whose territory the Israelites are conquering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>The capital city of Sihon, representing the Amorite kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of people living in the land east of the Jordan River, known for their opposition to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/conquest.htm">Conquest</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites capturing and destroying the cities of Sihon as part of their journey to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>The complete destruction of the Amorites demonstrates God's sovereign judgment against sin and rebellion.

The phrase fixes the moment: right after the defeat of Sihon, king of Heshbon, and immediately before crossing into Canaan. It reminds us that each step of the journey happened on God&#8217;s timetable, not Israel&#8217;s (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we captured all his cities</b><p>The &#8220;his&#8221; refers to King Og of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-4</a>).

What looked impossible&#8212;walled cities, iron beds, giant warriors&#8212;proved effortless for the God who had already split the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and devoted to destruction the people of every city,</b><p>To &#8220;devote to destruction&#8221; (herem) meant placing something irreversibly under God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). It was not ruthless conquest but holy obedience. The Canaanite cultures had filled up the measure of their sins (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>), and God used Israel as His instrument of justice (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). The act also safeguarded Israel from adopting pagan practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-17.htm">Deuteronomy 20:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including women and children.</b><p>This clause can feel jarring, yet it highlights the corporate nature of sin and judgment (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). In the ancient Near East, family and community were inseparable; leaving potential heirs would eventually recreate the same idolatry God was eradicating (<a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>). At the same time, Scripture later shows God&#8217;s mercy toward repentant outsiders&#8212;Rahab and her family, for instance (<a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12-14</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We left no survivors.</b><p>The totality of the judgment mirrors its finality.

Yet for Israel it was also a sober warning: if they turned to the same sins, the same fate awaited them (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-68</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34</a> records a real historical event that showcases God&#8217;s sovereign timing, His unstoppable power, His righteous judgment on entrenched evil, and His warning to His people.
