The use of an awl, a pointed tool for making holes, symbolizes a permanent mark of servitude. The act of piercing the ear at the doorpost is significant, as the doorpost represents the household and its protection. This ritual is rooted in ancient Near Eastern customs, where ear piercing was a sign of lifelong commitment and loyalty. The doorpost also has biblical significance, as it was used during the Passover in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>) to mark the homes of the Israelites, symbolizing protection and belonging. This act of piercing can be seen as a type of Christ's willing submission to the Father's will, as He became a servant to humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>and he will become your servant for life</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the lifelong commitment made by the servant. In the context of ancient Israel, servitude was often a temporary condition due to debt or poverty, with the Jubilee year providing release (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). However, this voluntary act of becoming a servant for life reflects a deep bond and trust between the servant and master. It highlights the servant's choice to remain in a situation where they find security and provision. This lifelong servitude can be seen as a parallel to the believer's eternal commitment to Christ, who calls His followers to serve Him wholeheartedly (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>And treat your maidservant the same way</b><br>This phrase ensures that female servants are given the same opportunity and respect as male servants in making a lifelong commitment. It reflects the equitable treatment of servants, regardless of gender, within the covenant community of Israel. This command underscores the importance of justice and fairness in relationships, aligning with the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). The inclusion of maidservants in this provision also points to the value and dignity of women in God's eyes, as seen in the New Testament where women are active participants in the early church (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the laws and commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>An individual who chooses to remain in servitude out of love and loyalty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The owner of the servant, who is responsible for the servant's well-being.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/door.htm">Door</a></b><br>The place where the servant's ear is pierced, symbolizing a permanent bond.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/voluntary_servitude_as_a_symbol_of_love_and_loyalty.htm">Voluntary Servitude as a Symbol of Love and Loyalty</a></b><br>The act of piercing the ear signifies a servant's voluntary decision to remain with their master out of love and loyalty, rather than obligation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_door.htm">Symbolism of the Door</a></b><br>The door represents a threshold or transition, symbolizing the servant's commitment to a new, lifelong role within the household.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_implications_of_servanthood.htm">Spiritual Implications of Servanthood</a></b><br>This passage can be seen as a metaphor for our relationship with God, where we willingly choose to serve Him out of love and devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_choice_in_service.htm">The Role of Choice in Service</a></b><br>The decision to remain a servant is a personal choice, highlighting the importance of free will in our spiritual journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_modern_application.htm">Cultural Context and Modern Application</a></b><br>Understanding the cultural context of ancient Israel helps us appreciate the depth of commitment involved, and we can apply this principle of loyalty and service in our relationships today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_15_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 15:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_15_17_Commitment_to_God.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:17 illustrate commitment in our relationship with God?

The pierced ear testifies to love-born loyalty, the door anchors that loyalty to a household, and the same privilege is granted to men and women alike.

The general right of release is stated here. One difference (as stated by Rashi) is that women were not liable to be sold for theft like men, but might be sold by their parents in infancy. If the girl were not marriageable when the first Sabbatical year arrived, she would obtain her freedom absolutely, because the case contemplated in <a href="/context/exodus/21-8.htm" title="If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.">Exodus 21:8-10</a> could not possibly arise.
