In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is instructing the Israelites on the necessity of following the rulings of the priests and judges. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where religious and civil laws were intertwined. The authority of these leaders was seen as divinely appointed, and their decisions were to be respected as coming from God Himself. This principle of obedience to authority is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are instructed to submit to governing authorities (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><b>at the place the LORD will choose</b><br>This refers to the central place of worship that God would designate, which later became Jerusalem with the establishment of the temple. The phrase underscores the significance of centralized worship and decision-making in Israel's religious life. It points to the unity and cohesion of the nation under God's chosen place, which was initially the tabernacle and later the temple. This centralization prefigures the coming of Christ, who becomes the ultimate temple and place of God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>Be careful to do everything they instruct you</b><br>This instruction highlights the necessity of careful adherence to the law and the decisions of the leaders. It reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's commands as a demonstration of faith and commitment to His covenant. The call to careful obedience is a recurring theme throughout Deuteronomy and the entire Bible, emphasizing that true worship and relationship with God involve not just hearing His word but also doing it (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). This careful obedience is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father and calls His followers to do the same (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_the_lord_will_choose.htm">The Place the LORD Will Choose</a></b><br>Refers to the central place of worship and judgment, which would later be established in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_judges.htm">Priests and Judges</a></b><br>The appointed leaders responsible for interpreting and applying God's law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides the law and guidance for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god-ordained_authority.htm">Obedience to God-Ordained Authority</a></b><br>God establishes leaders and systems of authority for the well-being of His people.
