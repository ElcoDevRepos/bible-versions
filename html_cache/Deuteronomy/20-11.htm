In the context of ancient Israel, offering peace was a common practice before besieging a city. This reflects God's desire for peace and mercy, even in times of conflict. The offer of peace can be seen as an opportunity for the city to submit to Israel's authority without bloodshed, aligning with the broader biblical theme of seeking peace (<a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>). It also foreshadows the peace offered through Christ, who is the ultimate peacemaker (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>).<p><b>and open their gates</b><br>Opening the gates symbolizes submission and acceptance of terms. In ancient times, city gates were crucial for defense, and opening them signified surrender. This act of opening the gates can be seen as a metaphor for opening one's heart to God's will, similar to the call for believers to open their hearts to Christ (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>). The gates also represent the transition from hostility to peace, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Christ breaks down the dividing wall of hostility (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>all the people there will become forced laborers</b><br>This phrase reflects the historical practice of subjugating conquered peoples. Forced labor was a common outcome for those who surrendered, as seen in other ancient Near Eastern cultures. This practice ensured the economic benefit of the victors and the integration of the conquered into the society. Biblically, this can be compared to the Israelites' own experience in Egypt, where they were subjected to forced labor (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>). It serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, yet also points to the ultimate liberation found in Christ, who frees us from the bondage of sin (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<p><b>to serve you</b><br>Service here implies a shift in allegiance and purpose. The conquered people were to serve the Israelites, which can be seen as a type of the service believers are called to in the Kingdom of God. This service is not just physical labor but a broader call to align with God's purposes. In the New Testament, believers are called to serve one another in love (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>), reflecting the transformation from serving earthly masters to serving Christ as Lord. This phrase also highlights the theme of servanthood, which is central to the life and ministry of Jesus, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people receiving the instructions from God through Moses.
