The scattering, or diaspora, is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God warns Israel of exile due to their unfaithfulness (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>). Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. The scattering serves as both a punishment and a means to preserve a remnant that will eventually return to God. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church being scattered among the nations to spread the Gospel (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1</a>).<p><b>and only a few of you will survive</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of the judgment, emphasizing that only a remnant will remain. The concept of a remnant is significant throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a> and <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>. It underscores God's mercy and faithfulness, ensuring that His covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are preserved despite widespread disobedience. The survival of a few also points to the hope of restoration and redemption, a theme that culminates in the coming of Jesus Christ, who gathers the faithful remnant to Himself (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p><b>among the nations to which the LORD will drive you</b><br>This part of the verse indicates that the scattering is not random but directed by God. It reflects God's sovereignty over the nations and His ability to use them as instruments of His will. The driving away of Israel serves as a reminder of the consequences of idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. It also sets the stage for the eventual ingathering of the exiles, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a> and <a href="/zechariah/10-9.htm">Zechariah 10:9</a>, which find their ultimate fulfillment in the eschatological hope of the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.

The verse stands as a sober reminder that rebellion invites discipline, yet it also shines with hope&#8212;because the God who disperses is committed to preserve and eventually restore those who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And the Lord shall scatter you.</span>--Our familiarity with this fact in history must not blind us to its force when uttered as a <span class= "ital">prophecy. </span>The fact that the Jews were taken captive for idolatry, and dispersed for the rejection of JESUS, is a remarkable proof that the real reason why they were brought into Canaan, and kept there, was to be witnesses for Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Few in number</span>; literally, <span class="accented">men of number</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that may be counted; few as compared with the heathen among whom they should be dispersed (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall lead you</span>.

Dispersed among the heathen, they, who had dishonored God by making an image to represent him, should be compelled to do service to mere dead idols, the work of men's hands, which not only could not hear or see, as God can, but also could not-perform even such animal functions as eating and smelling (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-9</a>). These idols are called "gods" by Moses, because they were so counted by those who worshipped them; elsewhere he stigmatizes them as "abominations," things to be loathed and abhorred (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>). As had been their sin, so should be their punishment; as they had dishonored God, so should they be themselves dishonored; as they had worshipped by an image him who is spirit and without form, they should be made to sink down to an utterly materialized worship, that of mere idols, the work of men's hands; as they had apostatized from the one holy and true God, they should be degraded to become the servants of abominations, objects of loathing and abhorrence (<a href="/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>; <a href="/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>). God, however, would not utterly cast them off: if, in their misery and degradation, they should repent and turn again to him and seek him sincerely and earnestly, they should find him; for he is a merciful God, and mindful of the covenant which he swam unto their fathers (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will scatter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1508;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
