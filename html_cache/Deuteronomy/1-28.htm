It echoes their lack of faith and trust in God's promises, despite His previous deliverance from Egypt and provision in the wilderness. This question highlights their fear and reluctance to enter the Promised Land, a recurring theme in the wilderness narrative.<p><b>Our brothers have made our hearts melt,</b><br>The "brothers" refer to the spies sent to scout the land of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>). Their negative report caused widespread fear and discouragement among the Israelites. The phrase "hearts melt" is a vivid expression of fear and loss of courage, often used in the Old Testament to describe overwhelming dread (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>).<p><b>saying: &#8216;The people are larger and taller than we are;</b><br>This description of the Canaanites emphasizes their physical stature, which intimidated the Israelites. The focus on size and strength reflects a human perspective, contrasting with God's perspective, which values faith and obedience over physical might (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>the cities are large, with walls up to the heavens.</b><br>The mention of fortified cities with high walls underscores the perceived impossibility of conquering the land. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of heavily fortified cities in ancient Canaan, such as Jericho. This imagery of "walls up to the heavens" is hyperbolic, emphasizing the Israelites' fear and sense of inadequacy.<p><b>We even saw the descendants of the Anakim there.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The Anakim were a race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament, known for their formidable size and strength (<a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>). Their presence in Canaan added to the Israelites' fear. The Anakim are often associated with the Nephilim from <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, contributing to the narrative of a land filled with intimidating adversaries. This fear of giants is later addressed by Caleb and Joshua, who encourage the Israelites to trust in God's power rather than fear human strength (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, recounting the events and the people's response to the report of the spies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spies.htm">Spies</a></b><br>Representatives from each tribe of Israel sent to scout the Promised Land, whose report caused fear among the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/anakim.htm">Anakim</a></b><br>A race of giants in the land, known for their formidable size and strength, causing fear among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_vs._fear.htm">Faith vs. Fear</a></b><br>The Israelites' fear of the Anakim and the fortified cities reveals a lack of trust in God's promises.
