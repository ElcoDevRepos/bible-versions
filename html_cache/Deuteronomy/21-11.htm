The "beautiful woman" refers to a captive from a conquered nation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, it was common for victors to take captives, including women, as part of the spoils of war. The emphasis on "beautiful" highlights the natural human attraction and the potential for desire, which is addressed in the subsequent instructions. This reflects the reality of human emotions and the need for regulation in such situations.<p><b>and you desire her</b><br>The desire mentioned here is a natural human response, but it is regulated by the law to prevent abuse and ensure the dignity of the woman. This regulation is significant in the ancient context, where women could be easily exploited. The law acknowledges human emotions but provides a framework to channel them appropriately. This reflects the biblical principle of self-control and respect for others, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>, which calls for sanctification and honor in relationships.<p><b>and want to take her as your wife,</b><br>The desire to take the woman as a wife rather than a concubine or slave indicates a level of commitment and responsibility. The law requires the man to marry the woman, which grants her certain rights and protections under Israelite law. This is a significant departure from the practices of surrounding nations, where captives could be treated as property. The requirement for marriage aligns with the biblical view of marriage as a covenant relationship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching on the sanctity and exclusivity of marriage, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-33</a>, where marriage is a picture of Christ's relationship with the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people receiving the law, God's chosen

Deuteronomy 21:11 Mean</div><b>If you see</b><p>The sentence sits inside Moses&#8217; instructions for Israel&#8217;s conduct in war (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-10.htm">Deuteronomy 21:10&#8211;14</a>). Victory would place foreign captives under Israel&#8217;s authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-14</a>). Instead of ignoring the realities of war, the Lord regulates them. His law recognizes what soldiers &#8220;see&#8221; but immediately frames vision inside covenant boundaries (<a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b> A battle-hardened soldier is reminded that Yahweh remains present even on foreign soil (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b> The sight of captives is not a cue for abuse; it is the moment when God&#8217;s law steps in to control the impulse (<a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;A beautiful woman among them&#8221;</b><p>Scripture acknowledges objective beauty (<a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a>; <a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>). Yet Moses underlines that the woman is &#8220;among them,&#8221; meaning she is not an Israelite but a foreigner, outside the covenant community. The phrase warns the soldier that her origin matters spiritually (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b> Beauty can draw the eye, but the law reminds Israel that holiness, not attractiveness, must guide decisions (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b> By identifying her as &#8220;among them,&#8221; the text anticipates the steps that will follow to integrate her into Israel or release her honorably (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And you desire her</b><p>Desire itself is not condemned, but it must be disciplined (Songs 4:9-10 balanced with <a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>). The Lord refuses to let passion govern unchecked. Instead:<p>&#8226; Desire is submitted to divine order&#8212;marriage or nothing (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Lust that ignores God&#8217;s limits leads to tragedy, as David learned with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2-4</a>).<p>By conceding the reality of desire while instantly surrounding it with safeguards, the law teaches self-control (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And want to take her as your wife</b><p>The text deliberately uses the covenant word &#8220;wife.&#8221; This is not a casual liaison or slavery. What follows in verses 12-14 builds a protective fence:<p>&#8226; She must be brought home, given time to mourn, and granted a full month before marriage can occur&#8212;safeguards that cool impulse and honor her humanity (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; If the man later decides against the marriage, he must let her go free; he &#8220;may not sell her for money, nor treat her as a slave&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-14.htm">Deuteronomy 21:14</a>), echoing <a href="/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10-11</a>.<p>&#8226; Marriage incorporates her into Israel, pointing to God&#8217;s broader plan to bless the nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-8</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<p>Thus the law elevates a captive woman&#8217;s status beyond the norms of ancient warfare, foreshadowing the gospel ethic that &#8220;there is no Jew or Greek&#8230; for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11</a> concedes that a soldier may notice and desire a foreign woman, yet it refuses to let that moment devolve into exploitation. God&#8217;s law transforms raw human impulse into a covenant-regulated act of marriage, protecting the woman&#8217;s dignity, curbing male lust, and keeping Israel holy. What begins with &#8220;seeing&#8221; must end, if at all, in a righteous, committed union or in her honorable release&#8212;a timeless reminder that God&#8217;s people must subject every desire to His righteous order.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">if you see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
