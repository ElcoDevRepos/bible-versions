In the biblical context, the heart and mind represent the center of one's being and decision-making. The call to "fix" these words suggests a permanent and deliberate effort to remember and live by God's laws. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, where the psalmist declares, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you." The emphasis on the heart and mind underscores the need for a holistic commitment to God's teachings, not just an external observance.<p><b>tie them as reminders on your hands</b><br>The instruction to tie God's words on the hands serves as a metaphor for action. In ancient Israel, the hand symbolized power and action, indicating that God's commandments should guide all deeds. This practice is physically represented in the Jewish tradition of wearing tefillin, small boxes containing scripture passages, during prayer. The act of tying these words on the hands is a call to let God's laws influence daily activities and decisions, ensuring that every action aligns with divine will.<p><b>and bind them on your foreheads.</b><br>Binding words on the forehead symbolizes constant awareness and mindfulness of God's commandments. The forehead, being the most visible part of the body, represents one's thoughts and intentions. This practice is also reflected in the wearing of tefillin, where one box is placed on the forehead, signifying that God's laws should be at the forefront of one's mind. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to renew their minds (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>) and to have the mind of Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5</a>), indicating a transformation that begins with one's thoughts and intentions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the commandments, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Law from God, which forms the basis of the commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which includes the laws and commandments they are to follow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/internalization_of_god's_word.htm">Internalization of God's Word</a></b><br>The command to "fix these words" emphasizes the need for God's commandments to be deeply rooted in our hearts and minds, not just superficially acknowledged.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolic_reminders.htm">Symbolic Reminders</a></b><br>The practice of tying reminders on hands and binding them on foreheads serves as a physical representation of the spiritual truth that God's word should guide our actions and thoughts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_faith.htm">Consistency in Faith</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to consistently remember and follow God's commandments, Christians today are called to live out their faith consistently in every aspect of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_teaching.htm">Generational Teaching</a></b><br>The passage underscores the importance of teaching God's commandments to future generations, ensuring that faith and obedience are passed down.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_commitment.htm">Holistic Commitment</a></b><br>The integration of God's word into daily life reflects a holistic commitment to God, involving heart, mind, and actions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_11_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 11:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_embed_these_words_in_us_today.htm">How can we "fix these words" in our hearts and minds today?
