In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is reiterating the covenant between God and the Israelites. The commandments refer to the laws given at Sinai, which are foundational for Israel's identity and relationship with God. Obedience is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, highlighting the conditional nature of the blessings and curses outlined in the covenant. This call to careful observance underscores the seriousness with which God views His laws and the expectation of His people to adhere to them.<p><b>I am giving you to follow</b><br>Moses, as the mediator of the covenant, is the one delivering God's commandments to the people. This reflects the historical context of the Israelites on the brink of entering the Promised Land. The phrase indicates that these commandments are not merely suggestions but divine instructions meant to guide the Israelites in their new life in Canaan. The giving of the law is a gift from God, intended to set Israel apart as His chosen people.<p><b>to love the LORD your God</b><br>Loving God is central to the covenant relationship. This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through obedience and devotion. The Shema, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, encapsulates this command to love God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. This love is foundational to the covenant and is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the teachings of Jesus, who identified it as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-38</a>).<p><b>to walk in all His ways</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies living a life that reflects His character and commands. This metaphor of walking suggests a continuous, active lifestyle of faithfulness and righteousness. It is a call to imitate God's holiness and justice, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God commands His people to be holy as He is holy. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to walk in the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><b>and to hold fast to Him</b><br>Holding fast to God signifies a deep, unwavering commitment and loyalty. This phrase suggests a covenantal faithfulness akin to the loyalty expected in a marriage relationship. It implies trust and reliance on God alone, rejecting idolatry and other allegiances. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to remain steadfast in their faith (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). Holding fast to God is both a personal and communal commitment, essential for maintaining the covenant relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law and commandments as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Ten Commandments, foundational to the laws given in Deuteronomy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which includes blessings for obedience and consequences for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_as_an_expression_of_love.htm">Obedience as an Expression of Love</a></b><br>True love for God is demonstrated through obedience to His commandments.
