The Israelites were primarily farmers, and the harvest was a critical time of year. The field represents the land that God had given to the Israelites as part of the Promised Land, a fulfillment of His covenant with Abraham. The act of harvesting is a reminder of God's provision and the fruitfulness of the land He promised.<p><b>and forget a sheaf there</b><br>A sheaf is a bundle of grain stalks laid lengthwise and tied together after reaping. Forgetting a sheaf could happen due to the busyness of the harvest. This oversight is not to be corrected by returning to retrieve it. The act of leaving the forgotten sheaf is a test of obedience and trust in God's provision. It reflects the principle of leaving the edges of the field for the poor, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>.<p><b>do not go back to get it</b><br>This command emphasizes the importance of generosity and trust in God's provision. By not returning to retrieve the forgotten sheaf, the landowner demonstrates faith that God will provide for their needs despite the loss. This principle of leaving behind part of the harvest for others is a recurring theme in the Mosaic Law, promoting social justice and care for the less fortunate.<p><b>It is to be left for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow</b><br>This phrase highlights God's concern for the marginalized and vulnerable in society. The foreigner, fatherless, and widow were often without means of support and were particularly vulnerable in ancient Israel. By providing for them, the Israelites were reflecting God's character and His commands to care for the needy. This provision is a practical application of loving one's neighbor and is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to care for widows and orphans (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><b>so that the LORD your God may bless you</b><br>The promise of blessing is contingent upon obedience to God's commands. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are often tied to faithfulness and obedience. The blessing is not just material but encompasses spiritual and communal well-being. It underscores the principle that generosity and obedience to God's commands lead to His favor.<p><b>in all the work of your hands</b><br>This phrase indicates that God's blessing extends beyond the immediate act of leaving the sheaf. It encompasses all aspects of the individual's labor and endeavors. The work of one's hands is a common biblical expression for one's efforts and productivity. This promise of blessing is a reminder that God is the ultimate source of prosperity and success, and it encourages a holistic view of work as an act of worship and service to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Deuteronomy, receiving laws and instructions from Moses as they prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners,_fatherless,_and_widows.htm">Foreigners, Fatherless, and Widows</a></b><br>Vulnerable groups in society who were often marginalized and lacked resources.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents the agricultural setting of ancient Israel, where the Israelites were to practice these laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who delivered God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands these acts of mercy and promises blessings for obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_heart_for_the_vulnerable.htm">God's Heart for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>This verse reveals God's compassion and justice, emphasizing His desire for His people to care for those who are marginalized.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_blessing.htm">Obedience and Blessing</a></b><br>The promise of blessing for obedience highlights the principle that God rewards those who follow His commands with a sincere heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The law encourages a communal approach to welfare, where everyone plays a part in supporting the needy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_worship.htm">Generosity as Worship</a></b><br>Leaving behind a portion of the harvest is an act of worship, acknowledging God's provision and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_love.htm">Practical Love</a></b><br>This commandment is a practical expression of love and faith, demonstrating that true faith is active and visible in our actions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_24_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 24:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_19_s_call_for_generosity.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:19 encourage generosity towards the less fortunate in society?
