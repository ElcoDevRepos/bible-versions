It suggests that the Israelites have been in a state of spiritual blindness and deafness since their exodus from Egypt. This ongoing condition highlights the stubbornness and rebellion of the people despite witnessing God's miracles and receiving His law. The phrase underscores the patience and long-suffering nature of God, who continues to work with His people despite their persistent disobedience.<p><b>the LORD has not given you</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's sovereignty in granting spiritual understanding. It suggests that the ability to comprehend spiritual truths is a gift from God, not something that can be achieved through human effort alone. This aligns with the biblical theme that true wisdom and understanding come from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). It also reflects the idea that God, in His divine wisdom, sometimes withholds understanding as a form of judgment or as part of His greater plan.<p><b>a mind to understand</b><br>The mind, in biblical terms, often refers to the seat of thought and intention. The lack of a mind to understand indicates a spiritual dullness or inability to grasp the deeper truths of God's covenant and commandments. This condition is not merely intellectual but spiritual, affecting the heart and soul. It echoes the New Testament teaching that spiritual truths are discerned through the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><b>eyes to see</b><br>Eyes to see symbolize the ability to perceive and recognize God's work and presence. The Israelites had witnessed numerous miracles, yet they failed to see God's hand in their lives. This blindness is not physical but spiritual, indicating a lack of insight and discernment. Jesus often spoke of those who have eyes but do not see, referring to a similar spiritual condition (<a href="/mark/8-18.htm">Mark 8:18</a>).<p><b>or ears to hear</b><br>Ears to hear represent the capacity to listen and respond to God's voice. The Israelites heard God's commandments and the words of the prophets, yet they did not heed them. This deafness is a metaphor for their disobedience and unwillingness to follow God's guidance. In the New Testament, Jesus frequently used the phrase "He who has ears, let him hear" to call for spiritual attentiveness and obedience (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>).<br><br>This verse as a whole serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of seeking God's grace for spiritual understanding and the dangers of hardening one's heart against His voice. It also foreshadows the New Covenant, where God promises to give His people a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>), ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who opens the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering this message.

They have watched manna fall, water gush from rock, and enemies crumble, yet their response remains shallow. <a href="/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9&#8211;10</a> recalls, &#8220;Your fathers tested Me&#8230; though they had seen My work,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/3-9.htm">Hebrews 3:9&#8211;10</a> echoes that indictment. The phrase &#8220;to this day&#8221; underscores the long-term nature of their dullness; time and exposure to miracles alone cannot create faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD has not given you</b><p>Here Moses acknowledges divine sovereignty. Spiritual perception is ultimately a gift. <a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a> reminds us the LORD makes &#8220;the mute or the deaf, the seeing or the blind.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9&#8211;10</a> shows God confirming Israel&#8217;s hardness, while <a href="/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a> records Jesus saying, &#8220;No one can come to Me unless it has been granted him by the Father&#8221;. Human responsibility is real, yet behind every awakened heart stands God&#8217;s merciful initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a mind to understand</b><p>The &#8220;mind&#8221; (literally &#8220;heart&#8221;) is the control center of life. <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> says, &#8220;For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding&#8221;. Apart from His work, the heart misreads God&#8217;s acts. <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33&#8211;34</a> promises a day when God will write His law on hearts, and <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14-16</a> reveals that in Christ that veil is lifted. Moses exposes the need that the new covenant will later satisfy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>eyes to see</b><p>Spiritual sight is more than witnessing events; it is discerning their meaning. In <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a> Elisha prays, &#8220;Open his eyes that he may see,&#8221; and the servant suddenly grasps the unseen armies of God. <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a> foretells Messiah opening blind eyes, while <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a> contrasts those who claim vision yet remain blind with those who see their need and are healed. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-4.htm">Deuteronomy 29:4</a> prepares us for that theme: without God&#8217;s gift, miracles remain opaque.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ears to hear</b><p>Throughout Scripture, hearing implies obedience. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-27.htm">Deuteronomy 5:27</a> captures Israel promising, &#8220;Speak to us all that the LORD our God will speak&#8230; and we will listen and do it,&#8221; yet their history proves otherwise. <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a> states, &#8220;You have opened My ears,&#8221; a foreshadowing of Christ&#8217;s perfect obedience. Jesus often cried, &#8220;He who has ears, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9</a>,15-16), and <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a> repeats the appeal to the churches.

Israel&#8217;s history illustrates human inability; God&#8217;s sovereign gift is essential for understanding, seeing, and hearing. The verse therefore magnifies God&#8217;s initiative and prepares the stage for the promised new covenant, where in Christ blind eyes open, deaf ears listen, and hearts finally comprehend the glory of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive.</span>--"To mark the mercies of the Holy One, blessed be He! and to cleave unto Him" (Rashi).

As they would not attend to God's word, as they had shut their eyes and their ears, that they might not see, or hear, or learn what God was teaching them by his conduct towards them, they had been left to themselves;
