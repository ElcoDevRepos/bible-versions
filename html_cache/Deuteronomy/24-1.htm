It was a legal and social contract, reflecting the union between God and His people. The marriage covenant is foundational in Scripture, symbolizing the relationship between Christ and the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<p><b>but she becomes displeasing to him</b><br>The term "displeasing" indicates a subjective judgment by the husband. In the cultural context, this reflects the patriarchal society where men held significant authority over family matters. The Hebrew word used here can imply a broad range of dissatisfaction, not limited to moral failings.<p><b>because he finds some indecency in her</b><br>"Indecency" is a key term, often debated among scholars. It suggests a moral or physical defect, but not necessarily adultery, which was punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). The ambiguity of "indecency" led to varied interpretations among Jewish rabbis, influencing later teachings on divorce.<p><b>he may write her a certificate of divorce</b><br>The certificate of divorce was a legal document, providing the woman with the right to remarry. This practice distinguished Israelite law from other ancient Near Eastern cultures, offering some protection to the woman. Jesus references this provision in <a href="/matthew/19-7.htm">Matthew 19:7-8</a>, highlighting the hardness of human hearts.<p><b>hand it to her</b><br>The act of handing the certificate signifies a formal and legal process. It underscores the seriousness of divorce, requiring deliberate action. This procedure ensured that the woman was officially released from the marriage covenant.<p><b>and send her away from his house</b><br>Sending her away reflects the finality of the divorce. In the historical context, a woman's security and social standing were tied to her husband's household. This phrase underscores the gravity of divorce, as it left the woman vulnerable, emphasizing the need for the certificate to protect her rights.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the law, God's chosen people, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The covenant relationship between a man and a woman, central to the social structure of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divorce.htm">Divorce</a></b><br>The legal dissolution of marriage, addressed here with specific conditions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/certificate_of_divorce.htm">Certificate of Divorce</a></b><br>A formal document required to legally end a marriage, providing protection and rights to the woman.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_context.htm">Understanding the Context</a></b><br>Recognize that <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a> was given in a specific cultural and historical context where divorce was already practiced.

The school of Shammai, on the other hand, taught that only for something disgraceful, such as adultery, could a wife be divorced (Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebrews et Talm.,' on <a href="/matthew/5-31.htm">Matthew 5:31</a>, Opp., tom. 2:290). Adultery, however, cannot be supposed here because that was punishable with death. <span class="cmt_word">A bill of divorcement</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a writing of excision</span>; the man and woman having by marriage become one flesh, the divorce of the woman was a cutting of her off from the one whole. Lightfoot has given (lee. et.) different forms of letters of divorce in use among the Jews (see also Maimonides, 'De Divortiis,' <a href="/deuteronomy/4.htm">Deuteronomy 4</a>. &sect; 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">marries</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
