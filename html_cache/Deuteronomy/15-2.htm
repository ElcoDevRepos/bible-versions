In the context of ancient Israel, this was a divinely instituted practice that occurred every seven years, known as the Sabbatical Year. This practice reflects God's concern for social justice and economic equality, ensuring that no Israelite would be permanently impoverished. It also symbolizes spiritual forgiveness, pointing to the ultimate remission of sins through Christ.<p><b>Every creditor shall cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor:</b><br>The command for creditors to cancel debts highlights the importance of compassion and mercy within the community. This practice prevented the accumulation of wealth by a few and the perpetual indebtedness of others. It reflects the principle of stewardship, where resources are seen as belonging to God and are to be used for the welfare of all. This anticipates the New Testament teaching of forgiving others as God forgives us (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>).<p><b>He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother:</b><br>The emphasis on "neighbor or brother" underscores the communal and familial nature of Israelite society. The term "brother" indicates fellow Israelites, emphasizing the covenant relationship among God's people. This practice fostered unity and mutual support, reflecting the love and care expected within the covenant community. It also prefigures the New Testament concept of the church as a family of believers (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><b>because the LORD&#8217;s time of release has been proclaimed:</b><br>The "LORD&#8217;s time of release" refers to the Sabbatical Year, a time set apart by God for rest and restoration. This proclamation was a reminder of God's sovereignty over time and resources. It served as a foreshadowing of the ultimate release from sin and death through Jesus Christ, who proclaimed the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-19.htm">Luke 4:19</a>).
