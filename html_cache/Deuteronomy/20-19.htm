The Israelites, under God's command, were instructed on how to conduct warfare ethically. This reflects God's concern for justice and mercy even in times of conflict. The extended time indicates a prolonged military campaign, which was a typical strategy to weaken a city's defenses and morale.<p><b>you must not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them</b><br>This command highlights the importance of preserving resources. Fruit trees were vital for sustenance and future prosperity. The prohibition against destroying them shows a respect for God's creation and a recognition of the long-term consequences of war. This principle of conservation can be seen as an early form of environmental stewardship.<p><b>because you can eat their fruit</b><br>The fruit trees provided necessary food for both the besieging army and the local population. This practical consideration ensured that the land remained productive and that the people could sustain themselves. It reflects a broader biblical theme of God's provision and the importance of maintaining resources for future generations.<p><b>You must not cut them down</b><br>This reiteration emphasizes the importance of the command. It underscores the value of life and productivity over destruction. In a broader biblical context, it aligns with the principle of preserving life and the earth, as seen in Genesis with the care of the Garden of Eden.<p><b>Are the trees of the field human, that you should besiege them?</b><br>This rhetorical question draws a distinction between humans and nature, emphasizing that trees are not enemies. It suggests a moral and ethical consideration in warfare, recognizing that not all elements of a city are to be treated as combatants. This reflects a broader biblical ethic of distinguishing between combatants and non-combatants, and it can be seen as a precursor to modern principles of just war.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people receiving the law and instructions from God through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commandments and laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land that the Israelites are preparing to enter and conquer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_warfare.htm">Siege Warfare</a></b><br>A military strategy involving surrounding and attacking a city to capture it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fruit_trees.htm">Fruit Trees</a></b><br>Trees that bear fruit, which are to be preserved during a siege for sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_creation.htm">Stewardship of Creation</a></b><br>God commands the preservation of fruit trees, highlighting the importance of responsible stewardship over creation.

But as the words stand in the text, they can only be rendered thus: "For the man s a tree of the field." This gives no good sense, or indeed, any sense at all; and hence it is proposed to alter the reading of the text so as to produce a meaning that shall be acceptable. From an early period the expedient has been resorted to of reading the clause interrogatively, and, instead of regarding it as parenthetical, connecting it with the following words, thus: "Is the tree of the field a man to come into siege before thee?" So the LXX., Rashi, etc. It has been thought that only a very slight change in the punctuation is required to justify this rendering (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>); but more than this is acquired: the subject and object are hereby reversed, and this is more than can be allowed. From an early period also it has been proposed to read the clause as a negation, "For the tree of the field is not a man to come into siege before thee." So the Targum of Onkelos, Abarbanel, Vulgate, etc. The sense here is substantially the same as in the preceding, and the same general objection applies to both. To both also it may be objected that by this way of taking the passage Moses is made to utter a sentiment at once puerile and irrelevant; for what need to declare formally, or in effect, that a tree is not a man? and what reason is there in this for not cutting down fruit trees any more than other trees? In the margin of the Authorized Version an alternative rendering is proposed, "O man, the tree of the field is to be employed in the siege." But admitting this as a possible rendering, it is exposed to the objection, on the one hand, that it is improbable that in a prosaic address like this an explanatory appeal would be introduced; and on the other, that it is inconceivable that Moses would in this casual and startling way anticipate what he goes on in the next sentence to express deliberately and clearly. The passage has probably suffered at the hands of a transcriber, and the text as we have it is corrupt. The sense put upon it in the Authorized Version is that suggested by Ibn Ezra, and in the absence of anything better this may be accepted. The fruit tree is man's life, as it furnishes that by which life is sustained, just as, in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, the millstone is called a man's life, inasmuch as it supplies the means of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you lay siege</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1464;&#1510;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6696.htm">Strong's 6696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To confine, bind, besiege</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for an extended</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">while fighting</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1469;&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1461;&#1447;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;hil&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
