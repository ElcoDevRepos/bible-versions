The Israelites were entering a land filled with idolatrous practices, and these images represented the deities of the Canaanites. Burning them was a symbolic act of rejecting and eradicating idolatry. This command reflects the first and second commandments given in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>, emphasizing the exclusive worship of Yahweh. The act of burning also signifies total destruction, ensuring that no remnant of idolatry remains to tempt the Israelites.<p><b>do not covet the silver and gold that is on them</b><br>The silver and gold adorning these idols were often seen as valuable and tempting. However, the command warns against coveting these materials, which could lead to idolatry or materialism. Coveting is addressed in the tenth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>), highlighting the internal struggle against desires that lead away from God. The Israelites were to trust in God's provision rather than seeking wealth from forbidden sources. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned against the love of money (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p><b>or take it for yourselves,</b><br>Taking the silver and gold for personal use would not only be an act of disobedience but also a potential gateway to idolatry. The Israelites were called to be a holy people, set apart for God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). By taking these materials, they risked integrating pagan practices into their lives. This command underscores the importance of obedience and the dangers of compromising with the surrounding culture.<p><b>or you will be ensnared by it;</b><br>The warning of being ensnared suggests a trap or a snare that leads to spiritual downfall. The allure of wealth and the influence of idolatry could lead the Israelites away from their covenant relationship with God. This concept of being ensnared is seen throughout Scripture, where sin is often depicted as a trap (<a href="/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>). The New Testament also warns believers to be vigilant against the snares of the devil (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>for it is detestable to the LORD your God.</b><br>The term "detestable" indicates something that is abominable or repulsive to God. Idolatry is fundamentally opposed to the nature and character of God, who is holy and demands exclusive worship. The detestable nature of these practices is reiterated in other parts of Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>) and throughout the prophetic writings. This phrase serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the seriousness of maintaining fidelity to Him. The call to holiness is a theme that runs throughout the Bible, culminating in the call for believers to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land that the Israelites are about to enter, which is inhabited by nations with idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The images of the gods of the Canaanites, which the Israelites are commanded to destroy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who detests idolatry and commands His people to remain pure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

Gideon later obeys this pattern by tearing down his father&#8217;s altar to Baal (<a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>). Complete removal guards hearts from compromise (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-17</a>), and it underscores that Yahweh tolerates no rival (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not covet the silver and gold that is on them or take it for yourselves</b><p>Even when idols are plastered with precious metals, the treasure must not be salvaged. The first sin in the land, Achan&#8217;s theft of devoted items, shows the cost of ignoring this warning (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-26</a>). The Tenth Commandment also forbids coveting (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>). Why such severity?<p>&#8226; Greed entangles the heart (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Touching what God has cursed brings its curse with it (<a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>).<p>&#8226; What seems valuable is actually devoted to destruction (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>).<p>The safest response is distance&#8212;&#8220;Better a little with righteousness than great gain with injustice&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or you will be ensnared by it</b><p>Idolatry is a trap, silently closing around those who toy with it. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30</a> warns, &#8220;Be careful not to be ensnared by their ways.&#8221; History proves the point: Israel repeatedly &#8220;served their idols, which became a snare to them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/106-36.htm">Psalm 106:36</a>). The New Testament applies the same principle: &#8220;Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>). Walking too close to sin&#8217;s edge invites bondage (<a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>); God&#8217;s people are called to flee, not flirt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it is detestable to the LORD your God</b><p>Idols and everything connected to them are abominations in God&#8217;s sight. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3-4</a> prescribes judgment on anyone who worships &#8220;the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven,&#8221; because such acts are &#8220;detestable.&#8221; The prophets reinforce this: &#8220;They have filled My inheritance with their detestable idols&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>).
