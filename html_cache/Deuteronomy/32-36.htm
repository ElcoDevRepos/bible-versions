In the context of Deuteronomy, this is a promise to Israel, reflecting God's covenant relationship with them. The term "vindicate" suggests a legal setting where God acts as an advocate for His people, ensuring justice is served. This is consistent with God's character as seen throughout the Old Testament, where He often intervenes on behalf of Israel against their enemies (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate vindication through Christ, who intercedes for believers (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>).<p><b>and have compassion on His servants</b><br>God's compassion is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting His mercy and love. The term "servants" refers to those who are faithful to Him, indicating a personal relationship. This compassion is not just emotional but leads to action, as seen in God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). It also points to the New Testament, where Jesus embodies God's compassion, healing the sick and forgiving sins (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p><b>when He sees that their strength is gone</b><br>This phrase indicates a moment of complete human weakness and helplessness. It reflects the times when Israel was overwhelmed by enemies or internal strife, such as during the Babylonian exile. Biblically, God often acts when human strength fails, demonstrating His power and sovereignty (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). This reliance on divine strength is a key theme in both the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>and no one remains, slave or free.</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the situation, where all human resources are exhausted. The mention of "slave or free" indicates that God's concern and action are not limited by social status, reflecting the inclusive nature of His care. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul writes that in Christ, there is neither slave nor free (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), emphasizing the universal reach of God's salvation and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is just and compassionate.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often referred to as His servants, who are the recipients of His promises and discipline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Those who serve God, indicating a relationship of obedience and dedication.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this song, delivering God's message to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A prophetic song delivered by Moses, found in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, which speaks of God's justice, mercy, and the future of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_compassion.htm">God's Justice and Compassion</a></b><br>God is both just and compassionate.
