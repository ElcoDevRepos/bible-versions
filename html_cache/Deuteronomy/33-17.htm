In ancient Near Eastern culture, the firstborn held a place of honor and authority, often receiving a double portion of the inheritance. The bull symbolizes strength, power, and fertility, common attributes associated with leadership and dominance. This imagery reflects the blessing Jacob gave to Joseph in <a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>, where Joseph is described as a fruitful vine. The bull's majesty signifies the prominence and influence that Ephraim, in particular, would have among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>and his horns are like those of a wild ox</b><br>Horns in biblical symbolism often represent power and might. The wild ox, or aurochs, was a powerful and untamable animal, emphasizing the formidable strength and military prowess of Joseph's descendants. This imagery suggests that Ephraim and Manasseh would be strong and capable in battle, able to defend themselves and assert their influence. The wild ox's horns also symbolize the ability to push forward and conquer, aligning with the blessings of prosperity and victory given to Joseph's line.<p><b>With them he will gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates the expansive influence and military success of Ephraim and Manasseh. The act of goring suggests aggressive and decisive action against adversaries. Historically, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were significant in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, with Ephraim often leading in military campaigns. The reference to "the ends of the earth" can be seen as hyperbolic, emphasizing the far-reaching impact and dominance they would have. This also foreshadows the eventual spread of Israel's influence and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham about his descendants being a blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>Such are the myriads of Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim, the younger son of Joseph, was blessed by Jacob to be greater than his older brother Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). The term "myriads" suggests a vast number, indicating Ephraim's significant growth and influence. Historically, Ephraim became one of the most powerful tribes in Israel, often representing the entire Northern Kingdom. This aligns with the prophetic nature of Jacob's blessing and the fulfillment of God's promises regarding the multiplication and prosperity of Joseph's descendants.<p><b>and such are the thousands of Manasseh</b><br>While Manasseh was the firstborn, his descendants are described as "thousands," indicating a substantial but comparatively smaller number than Ephraim. Manasseh's territory was large, spanning both sides of the Jordan River, which allowed for significant growth and influence. The distinction between "myriads" and "thousands" underscores the fulfillment of Jacob's prophecy that Ephraim would be greater than Manasseh, yet both would be blessed and prosperous. This reflects the broader theme of God's sovereignty in choosing and blessing according to His purposes, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>The younger son of Joseph, blessed by Jacob to become a multitude of nations.

The &#8220;his&#8221; points to the combined house of Ephraim and Manasseh.<p>- A firstborn bull is the prized, dominant male of the herd&#8212;strong, vigorous, and given pre-eminence. In Old Testament culture that picture shouts leadership and honor (cf. <a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>).<p>- &#8220;Majesty&#8221; underscores the dignity God Himself confers.

A wild ox (<a href="/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22</a>; 24:8) is untamable, unstoppable.<p>- Two horns point to the two tribes that sprang from Joseph. Both will wield God-granted authority.<p>- David later prayed, &#8220;You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>); same image, same Source of strength.<p>- For believers, God&#8217;s Spirit provides the driving power needed to stand firm and push back darkness (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With them he will gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth</b><p>- The horns become offensive weapons. Historically Joseph&#8217;s descendants helped lead Israel&#8217;s conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>; <a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-29</a>).<p>- The northern kingdom&#8212;often called &#8220;Ephraim&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>)&#8212;later dominated regional politics, fulfilling the &#8220;gore the nations&#8221; picture in part.<p>- <a href="/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a> uses the same wording of Israel as a whole: &#8220;He will devour hostile nations and crush their bones.&#8221; Moses narrows that promise to Joseph&#8217;s house.<p>- Ultimately the verse anticipates worldwide reach: &#8220;even to the ends of the earth.&#8221; God&#8217;s covenant plan always pointed beyond Israel&#8217;s borders (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). He would use Joseph&#8217;s territory (Samaria) as an early launchpad for the gospel (<a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Such are the myriads of Ephraim</b><p>- &#8220;Myriads&#8221; signals tens of thousands.

Half the tribe inherited land on each side of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-11</a>; 22:7).<p>- Though numerically smaller, Manasseh produced key figures like Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-16</a>) who delivered Israel through God&#8217;s power, proving that impact is not limited to size.<p>- Together the two tribes form a balanced picture: abundance (Ephraim) plus faith-tested courage (Manasseh).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a> paints Joseph&#8217;s posterity as a powerful, honored, and expansive force in Israel&#8217;s history. Like a firstborn bull, they enjoy pre-eminence granted by God. Like the twin horns of a wild ox, Ephraim and Manasseh are equipped to push back enemies and extend influence to the farthest horizons. Ephraim&#8217;s vast numbers and Manasseh&#8217;s sturdy thousands together fulfill Jacob&#8217;s earlier blessing and showcase God&#8217;s faithfulness. For today&#8217;s believer the passage is a vivid reminder that every ounce of true strength, authority, and fruitfulness flows from the Lord who keeps His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.</span>--Rashi refers this to the ten thousands <span class= "ital">slain </span>by Joshua, the Ephraimite leader, and the thousands slain by Gideon, who was of the tribe of Manasseh. He expounds nearly the whole of the verse in reference to Joshua and the conquest of Canaan. There is an obvious similarity in the song of the Israelitish women after the defeat of the Philistines, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands." The people "pushed to the ends of the earth" are taken to be the thousands and ten thousands of conquered Canaanites and Midianites. For a similar metaphor, see <a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm" title="And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus said the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.">1Kings 22:11</a>. Otherwise the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh would be the two-horned power of Joseph. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm" title="The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.">Daniel 8:20</a> for a simile of the same kind.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
