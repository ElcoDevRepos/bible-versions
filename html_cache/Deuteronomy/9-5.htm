The Israelites are reminded that their possession of the Promised Land is not due to their own moral superiority or virtuous behavior. This reflects the broader biblical theme of grace, where God's blessings are given not based on human merit but on His sovereign will. The Israelites, like all humanity, are flawed and have repeatedly demonstrated disobedience, as seen in their wilderness wanderings and previous rebellions against God (e.g., the golden calf incident in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>).<p><b>but it is because of their wickedness that the LORD your God is driving out these nations before you</b><br>The Canaanite nations were known for practices that were abhorrent to God, including idolatry, child sacrifice, and other forms of immorality (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). This phrase underscores God's justice in dealing with sin. The conquest of Canaan is portrayed as a divine judgment against these nations. This aligns with the biblical principle that God is patient but will ultimately judge sin (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p><b>to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</b><br>This phrase highlights the faithfulness of God to His covenant promises. The land was promised to the patriarchs as part of the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). This covenant is unconditional, based solely on God's promise and not on human action. The fulfillment of this promise is a testament to God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His word. This also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham, who brings spiritual inheritance to all believers (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16, 29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Moses is addressing the Israelites, reminding them of God's promises and the reasons behind their conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being led into the Promised Land, not because of their own righteousness, but because of God's promises and the wickedness of the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land that the Israelites are to possess, which is currently inhabited by nations whose wickedness has led to their displacement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs to whom God made promises regarding the land and the future of their descendants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The current inhabitants of Canaan, whose wickedness has led to God's judgment and the decision to give their land to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God acts according to His sovereign will and justice, not based on human merit.
