In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is recounting the events at Mount Sinai (Horeb), where the Israelites received the Ten Commandments. The LORD's ability to hear reflects His intimate relationship with Israel, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. This divine attentiveness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states that the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their cry.<p><b>and He said to me</b><br>This indicates direct communication between God and Moses, underscoring Moses' role as a prophet and mediator. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such direct communication from a deity was rare and signified a special relationship. Moses' unique position is further highlighted in <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>, where God speaks of Moses as one with whom He speaks face to face, unlike other prophets.<p><b>I have heard the words that these people have spoken to you</b><br>Here, God acknowledges the words of the Israelites, showing that He is not only aware of their actions but also their intentions and desires. This reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where the people agreed to obey God's commandments. The phrase also highlights the communal aspect of Israel's relationship with God, as the entire nation is addressed collectively.<p><b>They have done well in all that they have spoken</b><br>This commendation from God suggests that the Israelites' response was appropriate and aligned with His will. Historically, this refers to the moment when the people expressed their fear of God's direct presence and requested that Moses speak to God on their behalf (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>). Their recognition of God's holiness and their own unworthiness is seen as a positive step towards understanding the nature of their covenant relationship. This acknowledgment of their proper response is a precursor to the blessings and curses outlined later in Deuteronomy, which hinge on Israel's obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who listens to His people and responds to their needs and concerns.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet of Israel, who acts as an intermediary between God and the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving the Law and commandments as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai (Horeb)</a></b><br>The place where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_giving_of_the_law.htm">The Giving of the Law</a></b><br>The event where God communicates His commandments to the Israelites through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_listens_to_his_people.htm">God Listens to His People</a></b><br>God is attentive to the words and concerns of His people.

It will appear by comparison of the two passages that the promise of the prophet like unto Moses was given at this very time: "They have well said all that they have spoken. I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in His mouth." It is not a little remarkable that He who gave the Law from Sinai "in blackness and darkness and tempest" should, on that very day, acknowledge the need of a different form of teaching for His people, and should promise it then and there. But it must not be forgotten that He "whose voice then shook the earth" is the very same Person who "speaketh from heaven" now. He who pronounced the Law in the letter writes it on the heart by His Spirit. The Angel of the covenant and the Prophet like unto Moses are one. He who gave the Law on Sinai died under it on Calvary, and provided for its observance for ever.<p>(29) <span class= "bld">O that there were such an heart in them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Who will give that there shall be this heart in them, to fear me, and to keep all my commandments all the days? </span>He who asked the question has also supplied the, answer: "<span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">will put </span>my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them."
