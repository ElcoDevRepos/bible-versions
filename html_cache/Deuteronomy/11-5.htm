This period was marked by God's provision of manna (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>), water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>), and the guidance of the pillar of cloud by day and fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The wilderness journey is a testament to God's faithfulness and serves as a reminder of His ability to sustain His people in times of trial and scarcity. It also symbolizes the spiritual journey of believers, emphasizing reliance on God for sustenance and direction.<p><b>until you reached this place;</b><br>This phrase signifies the culmination of the Israelites' journey as they stand on the brink of entering the Promised Land. "This place" refers to the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River from Jericho, where Moses delivered his final speeches recorded in Deuteronomy. This location is significant as it represents the transition from a nomadic life to settling in a land promised to their ancestors. It underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and the importance of obedience and faithfulness to His covenant. The journey from Egypt to this point is a type of the Christian journey from sin to salvation, with the Promised Land symbolizing eternal life with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting God's deeds and faithfulness to the people as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who experienced His miraculous works and guidance during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites wandered for 40 years, a place of testing, provision, and divine encounters.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants, representing a place of rest and fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deeds.htm">God's Deeds</a></b><br>Refers to the miraculous acts and provisions God performed for the Israelites, such as manna, water from the rock, and guidance by the pillar of cloud and fire.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_faithfulness.htm">Remembering God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on past experiences where God has provided and guided you, strengthening your faith for current and future challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_in_god's_provision.htm">Trusting in God's Provision</a></b><br>Just as God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness, trust that He will meet your needs in times of uncertainty and trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_past_mistakes.htm">Learning from Past Mistakes</a></b><br>The Israelites' journey serves as a cautionary tale;

One instance of the latter is expressly referred to - the destruction of those who joined in the insurrection of Korah (cf. <a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). Moses does not mention Korah himself here, but only his accomplices Dathan and Abiram, probably, as Keil suggests, "from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah;" perhaps also because, though Korah was at the head of the insurrection, Dathan and Abiram were the more determined, audacious, and obdurate in their rebellion (cf. <a href="/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12-15, 25, 26</a>), so that it came to be named from them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
