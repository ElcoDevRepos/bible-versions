The concept of divine anger is consistent throughout the Old Testament, where God's holiness demands justice against sin (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). The "day" refers to a future time of judgment, often seen as a warning to the Israelites to remain faithful to the covenant.<p><b>and I will abandon them</b><br>Abandonment by God is a severe consequence of Israel's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. This echoes the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God warns of the repercussions of disobedience. The idea of God withdrawing His presence is a recurring theme, emphasizing the importance of His guidance and protection (<a href="/judges/10-13.htm">Judges 10:13</a>).<p><b>and hide My face from them</b><br>The hiding of God's face signifies a withdrawal of His favor and blessing. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the face of a deity represented presence and benevolence. This phrase is a metaphor for divine displeasure and is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe times of distress and divine silence (<a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>).<p><b>so that they will be consumed</b><br>The consumption here refers to the destruction and devastation that will follow God's abandonment. This is a fulfillment of the covenant curses, where disobedience leads to calamity (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>). The imagery of being consumed underscores the totality of the judgment.<p><b>and many troubles and afflictions will befall them</b><br>This phrase highlights the multiplicity and severity of the consequences Israel will face. The troubles and afflictions are both physical and spiritual, affecting the nation as a whole. This is reminiscent of the plagues and hardships described in the curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>.<p><b>On that day they will say,</b><br>The repetition of "on that day" emphasizes the certainty and imminence of the prophesied events. It also introduces a moment of realization and reflection for the Israelites, prompting them to acknowledge the cause of their suffering.<p><b>&#8216;Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is no longer with us?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question indicates a moment of self-awareness and recognition of the link between their suffering and God's absence. It reflects the covenant relationship where God's presence is contingent upon Israel's faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>). The disasters serve as a catalyst for repentance and a return to God, aligning with the prophetic calls for Israel to acknowledge their sin and seek restoration (<a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who is delivering God's message to the people.
