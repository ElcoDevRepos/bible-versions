They were responsible for maintaining justice and order, often serving as judges in legal matters. This reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where local governance was crucial. The role of elders is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/ruth/4-2.htm">Ruth 4:2</a>, where they witness Boaz's redemption of Ruth, and in <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>, where they assist Moses in leading the people.<p><b>must send for him</b><br>This phrase indicates a legal obligation, emphasizing the importance of justice and due process in Israelite law. The elders were required to act in accordance with the law, ensuring that the accused was brought to trial. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for justice, mercy, and humility.<p><b>bring him back</b><br>The act of bringing the accused back to the city underscores the seriousness of the crime and the need for accountability. It also highlights the community's role in upholding the law. This process ensured that justice was not left to personal vendettas but was handled within the legal framework established by God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, which commands the appointment of judges and officials to administer justice.<p><b>and hand him over to the avenger of blood</b><br>The "avenger of blood" was typically a close relative of the deceased, responsible for executing justice on behalf of the family. This practice was part of the ancient Near Eastern legal system, where family honor and retribution were significant. The concept of the avenger of blood is also addressed in <a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>, which provides guidelines for cities of refuge to protect those who killed unintentionally.<p><b>to die</b><br>The death penalty for murder reflects the sanctity of life as established in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God declares that whoever sheds human blood must have their blood shed. This principle underscores the seriousness of taking a life and the need for justice. It also points to the ultimate justice and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who, through His death and resurrection, offers forgiveness and life to all who believe, fulfilling the law's demands for justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_city.htm">Elders of the City</a></b><br>These are the leaders or judges responsible for maintaining justice and order within the community.
