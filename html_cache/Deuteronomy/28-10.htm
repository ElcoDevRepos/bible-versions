The promise is not limited to Israel alone but is meant to be a testimony to all nations. Historically, Israel was situated at a crossroads of ancient civilizations, making it a strategic location for influencing surrounding nations. This global perspective is echoed in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promises that all nations will be blessed through Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>will see that you are called by the name of the LORD</b><br>Being "called by the name of the LORD" signifies a special relationship and identity with God. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a name represented one's character and authority. Israel's identity was intrinsically linked to Yahweh, setting them apart from other nations. This calling is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of believers being called by the name of Christ (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>), indicating a new identity and mission.<p><b>and they will stand in awe of you.</b><br>The awe mentioned here is a recognition of God's power and presence with Israel. This reverence is not merely fear but an acknowledgment of the divine favor and protection over Israel. Historically, when Israel followed God's commandments, they experienced victories and prosperity that were evident to surrounding nations, as seen in the reigns of David and Solomon. This awe can be seen as a type of the reverence that will be due to Christ, who embodies the fulfillment of God's promises and commands respect from all nations (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, Moses is delivering God's laws and promises to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving the covenant blessings and curses as they prepare to enter Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that the Israelites are about to enter, representing God's promise and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_of_the_earth.htm">Nations of the Earth</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who will witness God's favor upon Israel if they obey His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_and_witness.htm">Identity and Witness</a></b><br>As God's people, our identity is rooted in Him, and our lives should reflect His holiness and love to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_blessing.htm">Obedience and Blessing</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commandments brings blessings that serve as a testimony to others of His goodness and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>Just as Israel was called to be distinct among the nations, Christians are called to live lives that are set apart, demonstrating God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The promises of God are sure, and His faithfulness to Israel is a reminder of His faithfulness to us today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/evangelism_and_influence.htm">Evangelism and Influence</a></b><br>Our lives should be a living testimony that draws others to God, much like Israel was to be a light to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_28_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 28:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_28_10_Importance_of_God_s_people.htm">How does Deuteronomy 28:10 emphasize the importance of living as God's people today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_being_named_by_the_LORD.htm">What does being "called by the name of the LORD" signify for believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Christians_reflect_God_s_presence.htm">How can Christians ensure their lives reflect God's presence as in Deuteronomy 28:10?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Links_between_Deut_28_10_Matt_5_16.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Deuteronomy 28:10 and Matthew 5:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Deut_28_10_promise_locally.htm">How can we apply the promise of Deuteronomy 28:10 in our community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_28_10_God_s_promise_to_Israel.htm">How does Deuteronomy 28:10 reflect God's promise to Israel and its historical fulfillment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_called_by_LORD_s_name.htm">What does being "called by the name of the LORD" mean in Deuteronomy 28:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Deut_28_10_Divine_favor_protection.htm">How does Deuteronomy 28:10 relate to the concept of divine favor and protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_david_slay_more_than_saul.htm">What does 'One Nation Under God' signify?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'be_sober_and_vigilant'_mean.htm">Whose is the Earth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_cowardice.htm">What does the Bible say about being cowardly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_repose_of_the_soul.htm">What is the Repose of the Soul?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 28:10 Mean</div><b>Then</b><p><a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> stands within a covenant framework of blessings for obedience.
