In ancient Israel, the sanctity of life was paramount, and the shedding of innocent blood was a serious offense. The law provided specific instructions for dealing with such situations to maintain communal purity and justice. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God values human life and justice (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>).<p><b>lying in a field</b><br>The mention of a field suggests a rural setting, common in ancient Israel where agriculture was the primary occupation. Fields were often isolated, making them potential sites for crimes. This setting emphasizes the need for communal responsibility in maintaining justice, as fields were shared spaces among tribes and families.<p><b>in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess</b><br>This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The land was a divine gift, a fulfillment of promises made to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It was not just a physical inheritance but a place where God's laws were to be upheld. The Israelites were stewards of the land, responsible for maintaining its holiness and justice.<p><b>and it is not known who killed him</b><br>The lack of knowledge about the perpetrator highlights the limitations of human justice and the need for divine guidance. In such cases, the community was required to seek God's direction to resolve the matter. This reflects the biblical theme of God as the ultimate judge who sees all (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). The procedure that follows in the text ensures that the community acknowledges their dependence on God for justice and cleansing from guilt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/slain_person.htm">Slain Person</a></b><br>An unidentified individual found dead, representing a situation of unresolved violence or injustice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/field.htm">Field</a></b><br>The location where the body is discovered, symbolizing the land given by God to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_your_god.htm">The LORD your God</a></b><br>The divine authority who provides the land and establishes laws for justice and community responsibility.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the land is given, responsible for upholding God's laws and ensuring justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unresolved_murder.htm">Unresolved Murder</a></b><br>The event of finding a body without knowing the perpetrator, prompting a communal response to seek justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes the collective responsibility of the community to address unresolved injustices.

Some have thought that the valley was neither to be eared (ploughed) nor sown from that time forward." The verbs are not past in the Hebrew, and the words <span class= "ital">may </span>bear this meaning. If so, the district in which the murder occurred would be mulcted in that portion of land for ever.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">And the priests.</span>--See on <a href="/deuteronomy/21-8.htm" title="Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to your people of Israel's charge.

The sacrifices are a "covering" for the sinner from a punishment of sin. According to Rashi, the prayer in the eighth verse is spoken by the priests; and it seems probable enough. No part in the transaction is assigned to them, unless it be this. And their presence was certainly necessary.<p><span class= "bld">And the blood shall be forgiven them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">shall be covered for them. </span>Not the same expression as <a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm" title="And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-31.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-35.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:35</a>. But we can hardly follow the Jewish commentators into the question whether, if the perpetrator of the murder were afterwards discovered, the blood of the heifer which had been shed already could be allowed to atone for it, so that the murderer need not be punished. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - If a body was found lying dead from a wound, and it was not known by whom the wound had been inflicted, the whole land would be involved in the guilt of the murder, unless it was duly expiated as here directed. First, the elders and judges (presumably of the neighboring towns; of Josephus, 'Antiq.' 4:8, 16) were to meet, the former as magistrates representing the communities, the latter as administrators of the law, and were to measure the distance from the body of the slain man to each of the surrounding towns, in order to ascertain which was the nearest. This ascertained, upon that town was to be laid the duty of expiating the crime. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[one] is found</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">slain,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pierced, polluted</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lying</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;p&#772;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in a field</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7695;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
