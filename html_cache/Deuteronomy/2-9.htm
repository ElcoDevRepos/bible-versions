It reflects the ongoing guidance God provided to the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This communication underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, as seen throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war</b><br>The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, which established a familial connection with the Israelites. This command reflects God's respect for this kinship and His sovereign plan for different nations. The Israelites were to avoid conflict with Moab, highlighting God's control over territorial boundaries and His plans for each nation. This instruction also demonstrates God's justice and mercy, as He had specific plans for Moab that did not involve Israelite conquest.<p><b>for I will not give you any of their land</b><br>God's sovereignty over the distribution of land is evident here. The Israelites were promised specific territories, and Moab was not included. This reflects God's covenantal promises and His faithfulness to His word. It also teaches the Israelites contentment and trust in God's provision, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5-6</a>, which speaks of God determining the boundaries of His people's inheritance.<p><b>because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession</b><br>Ar was a region in Moab, and this statement confirms God's allocation of land to the Moabites. The descendants of Lot, through Moab, were granted this territory by divine decree. This allocation is a reminder of God's promises and His remembrance of past covenants, as Lot was a relative of Abraham. It also foreshadows the idea of God preparing a place for His people, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in the New Testament with Jesus preparing a place for believers (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who guides and commands His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who receives and communicates God's instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A people descended from Lot, living in the region of Moab, east of the Dead Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ar.htm">Ar</a></b><br>A region or city in Moab given to the descendants of Lot.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, whose descendants include the Moabites and Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_sovereignty.htm">Respect for God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God has established boundaries and possessions for nations according to His divine plan.

Obedience is the only faithful response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not harass the Moabites</b><p>- &#8220;Harass&#8221; covers any kind of pressure&#8212;political, military, or even verbal. Israel is to leave Moab in peace.<p>- The Moabites descend from Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), making them distant relatives. God expects Israel to honor that family connection.<p>- By commanding restraint, the LORD calls Israel to act in a way that reflects His character of justice and mercy (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or provoke them to war</b><p>- God forbids any action that would bait Moab into battle. Israel must forsake aggressive tactics and trust God for future victories (cf. <a href="/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>; <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p>- This restraint highlights Israel&#8217;s unique dependence on divine timing. They will fight when and where God chooses&#8212;but not here, not now.<p>- Refusing to provoke war models the principle, &#8220;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I will not give you any of their land</b><p>- The land question belongs to God alone; He assigns boundaries (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>).<p>- Even promises made to Abraham do not override God&#8217;s specific allotments to other peoples. Obedience includes respecting limits.<p>- Israel&#8217;s identity rests on covenant, not conquest. Waiting for the promised Canaan tests faith and curbs covetousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession</b><p>- &#8220;Ar&#8221; is Moab&#8217;s chief city (<a href="/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>). God already deeded it to Lot&#8217;s line, establishing a legal claim Israel must honor.<p>- This decision reaches back four centuries to <a href="/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30-38</a>, proving God keeps ancestral promises&#8212;even those outside Abraham&#8217;s line.<p>- Respecting Moab&#8217;s inheritance teaches Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;to admire God&#8217;s sovereign generosity and to avoid presuming on someone else&#8217;s blessing (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God&#8217;s command in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> weaves obedience, restraint, and trust into a single fabric. Israel must not bully Moab, spark a war, or seize land God has reserved for Lot&#8217;s descendants. The verse reveals a God who speaks clearly, guards the vulnerable, fixes national borders, and expects His people to honor His sovereign assignments. Living by that same wisdom today means respecting God-given boundaries, treating others with dignity, and waiting on His perfect timing for every promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Distress not the Moabites . . .
