The Anakim were known for their impressive size and strength, which instilled fear in the hearts of the Israelites. This description emphasizes the formidable nature of the enemies that Israel was to face, highlighting the challenge before them. The Anakim's reputation for strength is also a test of faith for the Israelites, as they must rely on God's power rather than their own abilities.<p><b>the descendants of the Anakim</b><br>The Anakim are believed to be descendants of Anak, a notable figure among the giants. They are mentioned in several parts of the Old Testament, including <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>, where the Israelite spies report seeing them in the land of Canaan. The presence of the Anakim in Canaan serves as a reminder of the obstacles that the Israelites must overcome to claim the Promised Land. Historically, the Anakim are associated with the Nephilim, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, suggesting a lineage of giants that existed before and after the flood.<p><b>You know about them</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Israelites were already aware of the Anakim and their fearsome reputation. The knowledge of the Anakim's strength and size was widespread, contributing to the fear and hesitation among the Israelites. This awareness serves as a backdrop for the challenge of faith and obedience that God sets before His people, urging them to trust in His promises despite the intimidating circumstances.<p><b>and you have heard it said</b><br>This suggests that the reputation of the Anakim was not only known but also widely discussed among the people. The phrase implies a common saying or belief that had taken root in the collective consciousness of the Israelites. This reflects the cultural and psychological impact of the Anakim's presence, as their reputation alone was enough to cause doubt and fear.<p><b>&#8220;Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the perceived invincibility of the Anakim. It reflects the fear and intimidation that the Israelites felt when considering the prospect of confronting these giants. The question serves to highlight the human perspective of the situation, which contrasts with God's perspective. In a broader biblical context, this challenge is reminiscent of David's encounter with Goliath, another giant, where faith in God triumphs over physical might. The phrase calls the Israelites to remember that with God, all things are possible, and no enemy is too great to overcome.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anakim.htm">The Anakim</a></b><br>A race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament, known for their great size and strength.

The point is not exaggeration&#8212;it is sober reality. Yet throughout Scripture God delights in toppling what looks humanly unbeatable (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). Their towering size simply sets the stage for the Lord to display His greater power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the descendants of the Anakim</b><p>&#8220;Anakim&#8221; identifies a specific clan of giants, later called Rephaim (<a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>). Anak&#8217;s lineage is traced in <a href="/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-14</a> when Caleb drives them out of Hebron. Goliath of Gath likely descends from the same stock (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4-7</a>). Scripture treats these figures as literal people, not mythical monsters. By naming them, Moses reminds Israel that God&#8217;s promise is concrete: He will dispossess even the most formidable bloodlines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You know about them</b><p>Israel is not ignorant; the nation has carried this intel since Kadesh-barnea. Forty years earlier they let fear eclipse faith (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). Moses now calls on shared memory so the people will choose differently this time. <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a> cites how forgetting God&#8217;s works leads to rebellion; Moses wants the opposite&#8212;remember the foe, but remember the Lord more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have heard it said, &#8220;Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?&#8221;</b><p>This common saying captures the region&#8217;s awe of the Anakim, functioning like a proverb of hopelessness. Yet Moses quotes it to flip its meaning. <a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a> immediately answers: &#8220;But understand today that it is the LORD your God who crosses over ahead of you as a consuming fire.&#8221; God alone stands up to them, and because He leads Israel, the rhetorical question is settled. Similar taunts turn to triumph when God intervenes&#8212;see <a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a> contrasted with 17:45-47, and <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a> answered by 7:9-10.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2</a> spotlights an opponent renowned for size, lineage, and reputation so that Israel (and we) grasp the magnitude of God&#8217;s victory.
