It reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and His direct involvement in the affairs of nations. The Israelites are reminded that their success is not due to their own strength but to God's intervention. This assurance is crucial as they prepare to enter the Promised Land, facing formidable enemies.<p><b>as He did to Sihon and Og,</b><br>Sihon and Og were kings of the Amorites, defeated by the Israelites under Moses' leadership (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). These victories were significant as they demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in delivering His people. The mention of these kings serves as a reminder of past triumphs and God's ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. It also reinforces the idea that God is consistent in His actions and will continue to protect and guide His people.<p><b>the kings of the Amorites,</b><br>The Amorites were a prominent group in the ancient Near East, often depicted as strong and warlike. Their defeat by the Israelites was a testament to God's power over even the most formidable foes. This reference would have been particularly encouraging to the Israelites, as it highlighted God's ability to subdue powerful adversaries and fulfill His promises.<p><b>when He destroyed them along with their land.</b><br>The destruction of Sihon and Og, along with their territories, underscores the completeness of God's victory. It was not just the kings who were defeated, but their entire domains were brought under Israelite control. This total victory serves as a foreshadowing of the conquest of Canaan, where God would similarly deliver the land into the hands of His people. It also points to the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over all earthly powers, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful to His promises and powerful in His actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon_and_og.htm">Sihon and Og</a></b><br>Kings of the Amorites who opposed Israel during their journey to the Promised Land.
