This custom was designed to preserve the family line and inheritance within the tribe. The refusal of a man to marry his brother's widow was a significant decision, as it went against the cultural and legal expectations of the time. This practice is also seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-10</a>), where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>she is to go to the elders at the city gate</b><br>The city gate was the center of civic life in ancient Israel, serving as a place for legal transactions, public announcements, and the administration of justice (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). The elders were respected leaders and judges within the community, responsible for maintaining order and upholding the law. This setting underscores the formal and public nature of the widow's appeal.<p><b>and say, &#8220;My husband&#8217;s brother refuses to preserve his brother&#8217;s name in Israel.</b><br>Preserving a deceased brother's name was crucial in Israelite society, as it ensured the continuation of the family line and the retention of property within the tribe. This concept is rooted in the importance of inheritance and land distribution among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8-11</a>). The refusal to fulfill this duty was seen as a failure to honor familial and communal responsibilities.<p><b>He is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me.&#8221;</b><br>The duty of a brother-in-law, or levirate marriage, was not merely a personal obligation but a communal one, reflecting the interconnectedness of family and tribal identity in Israel. This duty is a type of Christ, who as our kinsman-redeemer, fulfills the law on our behalf and restores us to our rightful inheritance (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).

Erasing a name was tantamount to erasing a life from covenant history.<p>&#8226; Preserving the name upheld God&#8217;s promise that His people would endure (<a href="/isaiah/56-5.htm">Isaiah 56:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For the Church, caring for one another proclaims the name of Christ and the family identity we share (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The widow&#8217;s bold declaration exposes the brother&#8217;s neglect before witnesses, affirming that sin is never merely private.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Duty&#8221; frames the act as an obligation, not an option (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Verses 8-10 detail the consequences: public shaming and the symbolic removal of the brother&#8217;s sandal, marking him as one who would not build his brother&#8217;s house.<p>&#8226; Such discipline parallels New-Testament teaching that persistent neglect of family is &#8220;worse than an unbeliever&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice balances mercy with accountability, urging believers to honor commitments even when costly (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7</a> confronts a brother who shirks his God-given responsibility, provides the widow a righteous avenue for appeal, and upholds the vital covenant principle of preserving a family&#8217;s name. The passage showcases God&#8217;s care for the vulnerable, the importance of community oversight, and the seriousness with which the Lord regards familial duty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - If the man refused to marry the widow of his deceased brother, he was free to do so; but the woman had her redress. She was to bring the matter before the eiders of the town, sitting as magistrates at the gate, and they were to summon the man and speak to him, and if he persisted in his refusal, the woman was to take his shoe from off his foot, and spit before his face, and say, <span class="cmt_word">So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.</span> The taking off of the shoe of the man by the woman was an act of indignity to him; it amounted to a declaration that he was not worthy to stand in his brother's place, and was scornfully rejected by the woman herself. As the planting of the shod foot on a piece of property, or the casting of the shoe over a field, was emblematical of taking possession of it with satisfaction (<a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>); and as the voluntary handing of one's shoe to another betokened the giving up to that other of some property or right; so, contrariwise, the forcible removal from one of his shoe and the casting of it aside indicated contemptuous rejection of the owner, and repudiation of all his rights and claims in the matter. To walk barefooted was regarded by the Jews as ignominious and miserable (cf. <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2, 4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>). The spitting before the face of the man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> in front of him) is by the Jewish interpreters understood of spitting on the ground in his presence (Talmud, 'Jebam.,' 106; Madmen., 'In Jibbum.,' 4:6-8). This seems to be what the words express (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8</a>, for the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>); and this, according to Oriental notions, would be insult enough (cf. <a href="/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; Niebuhr, ' Description de l'Arabie,' 1:49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
