Meribah-kadesh is a location in the Wilderness of Zin, a desert region south of Canaan. The name "Meribah" means "quarreling" or "strife," reflecting the contentious nature of the event. The Israelites, during their wilderness journey, complained about the lack of water. This incident is significant as it marks a moment of testing and disobedience. Geographically, the Wilderness of Zin is part of the larger Negev desert, a harsh environment that tested the faith and endurance of the Israelites.<p><b>both of you broke faith with Me among the Israelites</b><br>The "both of you" refers to Moses and Aaron. This phrase highlights their failure to uphold God's command. In <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>, God instructed Moses to speak to the rock to bring forth water, but Moses struck the rock twice with his staff instead. This act of disobedience is seen as a breach of faith, as it demonstrated a lack of trust in God's word. The breaking of faith is a serious charge, as Moses and Aaron were leaders chosen by God to guide His people. Their actions set a poor example for the Israelites, undermining their leadership and God's authority.<p><b>by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of reverence and obedience to God. Treating God as holy involves recognizing His sovereignty and following His commands precisely. Moses and Aaron's failure to do so at Meribah-kadesh was a significant transgression. In <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>, God emphasizes the need for His holiness to be acknowledged by those who approach Him. This incident serves as a reminder of the consequences of failing to honor God properly. It also foreshadows the ultimate holiness and obedience of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's will and demonstrated complete reverence for the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who was chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
