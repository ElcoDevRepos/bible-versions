In the context of ancient Israel, sexual purity was highly valued, and premarital relations were considered a serious offense. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sexual morality, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, which emphasizes the body as a temple of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>must pay the young woman&#8217;s father fifty shekels of silver</b><br>The payment of fifty shekels of silver is a form of bride price or dowry, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This payment served as compensation to the family for the loss of the woman's virginity and potential marriage prospects. The amount, fifty shekels, is significant and substantial, indicating the seriousness of the offense. This practice is also seen in <a href="/genesis/34-12.htm">Genesis 34:12</a>, where Shechem offers a bride price for Dinah.<p><b>and she must become his wife</b><br>This requirement for marriage was intended to provide protection and security for the woman, who might otherwise be left vulnerable and without prospects for marriage. It reflects the cultural context where a woman's social status and future were closely tied to her marital status. This law aimed to ensure that the man took responsibility for his actions and the well-being of the woman.<p><b>because he has violated her</b><br>The term "violated" indicates a breach of moral and social order. In biblical law, such an act was not only a personal offense but also a violation of community standards. This reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and restitution, as seen in <a href="/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16-17</a>, where similar laws are given regarding seduction and marriage.<p><b>He must not divorce her as long as he lives</b><br>This stipulation underscores the permanence of marriage and the man's lifelong responsibility to the woman he has wronged. It reflects the biblical view of marriage as a covenant, as seen in <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>, where God expresses His disdain for divorce.
