The "oath" is the solemn agreement that binds the Israelites to follow God's commandments. In biblical context, oaths were serious commitments, often sealed with sacrifices or rituals. The Israelites are reminded of the blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>he invokes a blessing on himself</b><br>This reflects a self-deceptive attitude where an individual assumes they can claim God's blessings without adhering to His commandments. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, blessings and curses were understood as tangible realities, not just spiritual or emotional states. This self-invocation of blessing is a false assurance, ignoring the conditional nature of God's promises.<p><b>saying, &#8216;I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase highlights the danger of self-reliance and pride. "Stubbornness of heart" is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with rebellion against God (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). The false sense of peace is a delusion, as true peace comes from obedience to God. This mirrors the warning in <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>, where false prophets declare peace when there is none.<p><b>This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.</b><br>The imagery of "watered land" and "dry" land signifies the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, both fertile and barren lands were crucial for survival. The disaster represents the consequences of disobedience affecting all aspects of life. This echoes the curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>, where the heavens become bronze and the earth iron, symbolizing drought and hardship.

The word is only found here and in <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm" title="So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.">Psalm 81:12</a> outside the writings of Jeremiah, who uses it eight times.<p><span class= "bld">To add drunkenness to thirst</span>--i.e., the indulgence of the desire to the desire itself; to add sin to temptation. The LXX. have a strange paraphrase, "So that the sinner shall not involve the righteous with him in destruction." The thought seems to be that, perhaps, one idolater would not make so much difference to Israel. He would never involve the whole nation in destruction. The drunkard could not be the ruin of the thirsty, so to speak, and, therefore, he might do as he pleased, and might, in fact, escape punishment, being protected by the general prosperity of Israel. The quotation in the Epistle to the Hebrews meets this mistaken view admirably: "Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and <span class= "ital">thereby many be defiled." </span>The Targums render "to add sins of infirmity to sins of presumption," a rendering which partly explains that of the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he bless himself in his heart</span>; - congratulate himself - <span class="cmt_word">saying, I shall have peace</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all shall be well with me - though - rather, for - <span class="cmt_word">I walk in the imagination of mine heart</span>; literally, in <span class="accented">the firmness or hardness of my heart</span>, (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to twist together, to be tough or firm); the word is always used in a bad sense in Hebrew, though not in Aramaic (cf. <a href="/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a> [12]; <a href="/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13</a> [14]; 11:8). <span class="cmt_word">To add drunkenness to thirst</span>; a proverbial expression, of which very different explanations have been given. It is now generally admitted that the verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) cannot be taken here in the sense of "add," but has its proper sense of pouring out, pouring away, destroying. The word rendered "drunkenness" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to be sated with moisture, to be drenched) means rather "sated, drenched, well-watered;" and the word rendered "thirst" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, to thirst) is properly thirsty, and is used of dry land (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>); both are adjectives, and a substantive is to be supplied. Some supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, soul or person; others, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e5;</span>, land. The former render, "The full [soul] with the thirsty" (Gesenius); or, "Them that are sated with them that are thirsty," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as well those who have imbibed the poison as those who thirst for it (Knobel); or "That the sated [soul] may destroy the thirsty," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that the impious one, restrained by no law and, as it were, drunk with crime, may corrupt others, also prone to evil, and bring on them destruction (Maurer). Those who supply "land," render "To destroy the well-watered [land] with the dry." This last seems the preferable rendering; but the general meaning is the same in either case, viz. that the effect of such hardness of heart would be to destroy one and all.
