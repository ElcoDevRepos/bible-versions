Sihon ruled over a territory east of the Jordan River, which was strategically important for Israel's passage into Canaan. The Amorites were a powerful people, and their defeat demonstrated God's power and faithfulness to Israel. This victory is recounted in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a> and is celebrated in <a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>. The conquest of Sihon's land was a fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land of their enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-37</a>).<p><b>who lived in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon and a significant urban center in the region. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a fortified city, which underscores the military achievement of Israel in capturing it. The city later became part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>). Heshbon's capture is a testament to God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises to the Israelites.<p><b>and then at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan</b><br>Og, king of Bashan, was another formidable opponent, known for his giant stature (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>). The battle at Edrei was crucial as Bashan was a fertile and prosperous region. The defeat of Og is mentioned in several biblical passages (<a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a>, <a href="/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a>) and is seen as a demonstration of God's might and the assurance of His promises. Og's defeat also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over all powers and principalities (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>who lived in Ashtaroth</b><br>Ashtaroth was one of the principal cities of Og's kingdom and a center of worship for the Canaanite goddess Astarte. The city's name reflects the prevalent pagan practices that Israel was to avoid. The conquest of Ashtaroth symbolizes the triumph of the worship of Yahweh over idolatry. This victory foreshadows the spiritual conquest of Christ, who overcomes sin and idolatry, establishing His kingdom of righteousness (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_the_amorites.htm">Sihon, King of the Amorites</a></b><br>Sihon was a powerful king who ruled over the Amorites, a group of people living in the region east of the Jordan River.
