Moses is seen as a prophet and leader, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness. This divine communication underscores the authority of the message and the seriousness of the forthcoming prophecy.<p><b>You will soon rest with your fathers</b><br>This is a euphemism for death, indicating that Moses' life is nearing its end. "Rest with your fathers" reflects the Hebrew understanding of death as joining one's ancestors, a common cultural expression. It also signifies the transition of leadership to Joshua, as Moses' mission is complete.<p><b>and these people will rise up</b><br>The phrase "rise up" suggests a deliberate action, indicating that the Israelites will actively choose to engage in the behavior described. This foreshadows the recurring cycle of sin and repentance seen throughout the history of Israel, particularly in the Book of Judges.<p><b>and prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering</b><br>This metaphor of prostitution is used throughout the Bible to describe idolatry, emphasizing unfaithfulness to God. The "foreign gods" refer to the deities worshiped by the Canaanites, whose land the Israelites are about to enter. This highlights the temptation and spiritual danger posed by the surrounding pagan cultures.<p><b>They will forsake Me</b><br>Forsaking God implies a conscious decision to abandon the covenant relationship. This reflects the recurring theme of Israel's infidelity and the human tendency to turn away from God despite His faithfulness. It also serves as a warning of the consequences of such actions.<p><b>and break the covenant I have made with them</b><br>The covenant refers to the Mosaic Covenant established at Sinai, which includes the Ten Commandments and other laws. Breaking this covenant means violating the terms of the agreement, which was meant to set Israel apart as God's chosen people. This breach would lead to divine judgment, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28-30</a>, and foreshadows the eventual exile of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks to Moses about the future of the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is nearing the end of his life and leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are about to enter the Promised Land but are warned of future unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>The deities worshiped by the inhabitants of the Promised Land, representing a temptation for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The solemn agreement between God and Israel, which the Israelites are warned they will break.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.<br><br>Believers must be vigilant against modern forms of idolatry, such as materialism, power, or relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_covenant_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's covenant with His people requires loyalty and obedience.<br><br>Christians are called to remain faithful to the New Covenant through Christ, living lives that reflect His teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">The Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>Turning away from God leads to spiritual and often physical consequences.<br><br>The history of Israel serves as a warning to remain steadfast in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_foreknowledge_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Foreknowledge and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God knows the future and warns His people out of love and a desire for their faithfulness.<br><br>Trusting in God's sovereignty helps believers navigate challenges and temptations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_31_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_31_16_s_warning_on_foreign_gods_today.htm">How does Deuteronomy 31:16 warn against turning to "foreign gods" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Consequences_of_forsaking_God_in_Deut_31_16.htm">What consequences arise from "forsaking" God, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_faithful_against_idol_temptations.htm">How can we remain faithful amidst temptations to "prostitute themselves" with idols?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Links_between_Deut_31_16_1st_Commandment.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Deuteronomy 31:16 and the First Commandment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_31_16_warnings_daily.htm">How can we apply the warnings of Deuteronomy 31:16 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_predict_Israel_s_future_unfaithfulness.htm">Why does God predict Israel's future unfaithfulness in Deuteronomy 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_31_16_s_impact_on_free_will.htm">How does Deuteronomy 31:16 challenge the concept of free will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Deut_31_16_on_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">What does Deuteronomy 31:16 reveal about God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_31.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_god's_prediction_negate_free_will.htm">Does God&#8217;s prediction of Israel&#8217;s rebellion (Deut. 31:16) conflict with the principle of free will, implying a predetermined outcome?

The verse highlights God&#8217;s foreknowledge, the human tendency toward unfaithfulness, and the seriousness of covenant violation. It warns every generation to guard the heart, cling to the LORD alone, and remember that obedience brings blessing while apostasy invites discipline&#8212;yet God&#8217;s redemptive plan still stands ready for those who return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16, 19) <span class= "bld">Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers . . . now therefore write ye this song.</span>--This prophecy that the children of Israel would forsake Jehovah and break His covenant is not a little remarkable, when we consider His dealings with them as a nation. It is one of the many proofs in Holy Scripture that our Creator is not like the man in our Lord's parable, who "intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it." When He chose Israel to be His people, He knew the risk of doing so, and He provided for it beforehand. Not less when He said, "Let us make man in our image, <span class= "ital">after our likeness," </span>did He provide the means of forming in us the Divine character by all that Christ has done. The fall is recorded in the third chapter of Genesis. Redemption and restoration are exhibited in type and symbol in the second chapter. God brought Israel into Canaan in full foreknowledge of what the people would become when there.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">And break my covenant.</span>--With this, contrast <a href="/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Judges 2:1</a> : "I said, <span class= "ital">I will never break my covenant </span>with you."
