The Israelites were on a journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, a journey that symbolizes the Christian's spiritual journey from sin to salvation. The "not yet" suggests a period of waiting and preparation, reflecting the Christian life as a pilgrimage toward eternal rest.<p><b>to the resting place</b><br>The "resting place" refers to the land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It symbolizes peace and security after the Israelites' long period of wandering in the wilderness. In a broader theological context, it prefigures the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), where believers find spiritual rest from the works of the law.<p><b>and the inheritance</b><br>The "inheritance" is the land of Canaan, a tangible sign of God's covenant with Israel. Inheritance in biblical terms often signifies a gift from God, not earned but given by grace. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), receiving an eternal inheritance in the kingdom of God.<p><b>that the LORD your God is giving you</b><br>This emphasizes God's sovereignty and grace. The land is a gift from God, not a result of Israel's own efforts. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God is the provider and protector. This mirrors the New Testament teaching of salvation as a gift from God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), not based on human merit but on divine grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are on the brink of entering the Promised Land after their exodus from Egypt and years of wandering in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to Abraham and his descendants, representing a place of rest and inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful to His promises and is leading His people to their inheritance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The period of wandering and testing for the Israelites, symbolizing a time of preparation and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_promises.htm">Understanding God's Promises</a></b><br>Recognize that God's promises often involve a journey and a process of preparation.

The wilderness journey is not an end in itself but a passageway. Just as <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a> notes that the patriarchs confessed they were &#8220;strangers and pilgrims on the earth,&#8221; the people camped on the plains of Moab have miles to go&#8212;both literally and spiritually. In the same way, <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> encourages believers that &#8220;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion,&#8221; underscoring that life in Christ is a dynamic walk, not a static stopover.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the resting place</b><p>&#8220;Resting place&#8221; calls to mind Canaan as a land of settled peace, where wandering tents give way to rooted homes (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>). God&#8217;s rest is more than relief from travel; it is the fulfillment of His covenant promise (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). <a href="/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a> ties that rest to wholehearted obedience, while <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a> extends the theme to every believer: &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary&#8230; and I will give you rest.&#8221; Until Israel crosses the Jordan, rest remains a future gift, keeping their hearts looking forward, not backward to Egypt (<a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the inheritance</b><p>Inheritance speaks of permanence and possession. Unlike the manna that fell day-to-day, inheritance is a once-for-all deed of grace (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>). Peter echoes this in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, praising God for &#8220;an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.&#8221; For Israel, tribal allotments would secure each family&#8217;s future (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-24</a>). For believers today, every spiritual blessing in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>) is a down payment of an eternal portion reserved in heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD your God is giving you</b><p>The verb &#8220;is giving&#8221; keeps the spotlight on God&#8217;s initiative. Canaan is not earned but bestowed, reflecting grace rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a> warns them not to forget the Giver once they enjoy the gift. <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a> mirrors this dynamic: Jesus prepares a place for His followers, ensuring that the promise, the preparation, and the possession all stem from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9</a> frames Israel&#8217;s present as a midpoint between redemption and fulfillment. They are not yet at rest, not yet holding their inheritance, but the LORD is actively giving both. The verse calls God&#8217;s people&#8212;then and now&#8212;to travel in trust, work in hope, and worship the One who turns promises into possessed realities.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>9<span class= "note">)</span> <span class= "bld">Ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance.</span>--Nor would the passage of Jordan and the conquest of Joshua bring them to it.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the resting place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#601;&#183;n&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
