In the context of Deuteronomy, the Israelites are instructed to worship at the place God chooses, which later becomes Jerusalem. Rejoicing before the LORD signifies a communal and joyful acknowledgment of God's blessings and provision. This command to rejoice is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where worship is not just a duty but a celebration of His faithfulness.<p><b>you, your sons and daughters,</b><br>The inclusion of sons and daughters highlights the family unit's role in worship and the transmission of faith. It underscores the importance of involving the entire family in religious observance, ensuring that the knowledge and reverence for God are passed down through generations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of family as a foundational institution for spiritual education and continuity.<p><b>your menservants and maidservants,</b><br>This phrase indicates the inclusive nature of worship, extending beyond the immediate family to include servants. It reflects the social structure of ancient Israel, where households often included servants who were considered part of the extended family. By including them in worship, the text emphasizes equality before God and the communal aspect of worship, where all members of the household, regardless of social status, participate in the joy of God's presence.<p><b>and the Levite within your gates,</b><br>The Levites, who were set apart for religious duties, did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were supported by the tithes and offerings of the people. This phrase underscores the responsibility of the Israelites to care for the Levites, who served as priests and teachers of the Law. It also highlights the Levites' integral role in leading worship and maintaining the spiritual health of the community.<p><b>since he has no portion or inheritance among you.</b><br>This refers to the unique position of the Levites, who were given no land inheritance in the Promised Land. Their inheritance was the LORD Himself, and they were sustained by the offerings of the people. This arrangement points to a life of faith and dependence on God, serving as a type of Christ, who also had no earthly inheritance and relied on the provision of God. The Levites' role foreshadows the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, where spiritual inheritance is found in Christ rather than in earthly possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Deuteronomy, the chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands worship and obedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi, who were set apart for religious duties and had no land inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_daughters.htm">Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>Represents the family unit, emphasizing the inclusion of all family members in worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/menservants_and_maidservants.htm">Menservants and Maidservants</a></b><br>Servants within the household, indicating that worship and joy before the Lord are for everyone, regardless of social status.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_worship.htm">Joy in Worship</a></b><br>Worship is not just a duty but a source of joy.

In <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/12.htm">Deuteronomy 12</a>, the people are abandoning pagan altars and embracing God&#8217;s appointed way, echoing Jesus&#8217; words that &#8220;true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You, your sons and daughters</b><p>&#8226; Every family member is invited.

Joyful worship is communal, inclusive, and generous, acknowledging God&#8217;s provision and caring for those who serve Him full-time. The verse models a life where obedience produces gladness, families and workplaces echo that joy, and spiritual leaders are honored&#8212;painting a timeless picture of God-centered community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Of their offerings they should make a festive meal for themselves and their household; and of this the Levite who might happen at the time to be resident among them was to partake. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice before the Lord.</span> This phrase occurs frequently in this book (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>); elsewhere it appears only once - <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, where it is used with reference to the Feast of Tabernacles, Moses now enjoins this festivity to be observed in connection with all the sacrificial meals. <span class="cmt_word">The Levite that is within your gates.</span> The Levites had no share in the land as the property of their tribe; but they had towns allotted to them among the different tribes (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>.), so that in this way they were dispersed through the nation. Hence, perhaps, they are described as "within the gates" of the rest of the people. Or, as the Levites seem to have itinerated in the discharge of various offices among the people, the phrase may designate them as on this account occasionally resident among others in their community; just as "the stranger that is within thy gates" means the person of some other nation who for the time being was resident in any of the towns of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you shall rejoice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;ma&#7717;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
