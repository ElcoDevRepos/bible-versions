This is unique in Scripture, as it is the only instance where God is directly involved in a burial. It underscores the special relationship between God and Moses, who was described as a prophet whom the Lord knew face to face (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>). This act also signifies the honor and respect God had for Moses, who led the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness for 40 years.<p><b>in a valley in the land of Moab</b><br>The land of Moab is located east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. Moab was a region often in conflict with Israel, yet it was here that Moses viewed the Promised Land from Mount Nebo before his death. The valley signifies a low place, perhaps symbolizing humility, contrasting with the high places often associated with divine encounters. This location outside the Promised Land fulfills God's word that Moses would see the land but not enter it (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).<p><b>facing Beth-peor</b><br>Beth-peor was a location associated with the worship of the Moabite god Baal-peor. This reference may serve as a reminder of Israel's past idolatry and the need for faithfulness to God. The proximity to Beth-peor highlights the contrast between the faithfulness of Moses and the unfaithfulness of the Israelites at that site (<a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>).<p><b>and no one to this day knows the location of his grave</b><br>The anonymity of Moses' grave prevents it from becoming a site of idolatry or pilgrimage, ensuring that the focus remains on God rather than on a human leader. This also emphasizes the transition of leadership to Joshua and the continuation of God's plan for Israel. The mystery surrounding the grave has led to various traditions and speculations, but the text makes it clear that the exact location is unknown, reinforcing the idea that Moses' legacy is spiritual rather than physical.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the servant of the Lord who led the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The rabbins say that Moses was buried by retiring into a cavern, where he died and where his body remained. It is probable that, like Enoch and Elijah, he was transferred to the invisible world without seeing corruption. Hence his appearance along with Elijah in bodily form on the Mount of the Transfiguration; and hence also, perhaps, the tradition of the contest for the body of Moses between Michael and Satan (<a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>). If the body of <span class="accented">Moses</span> was actually buried, the concealment of his grave so that no man knew of it may be justly regarded as "the first instance on record of the providential obliteration, so remarkably exemplified afterwards in the gospel history, of the ' holy places' of Palestine; the providential safeguard against their elevation to a sanctity which might endanger the real holiness of the history and religion which they served to commemorate" (Stanley). The reverence which the Jews paid to graves shows that there was no small danger of their coming under a superstitious regard to that of Moses had it been known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And He buried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
