The "hornet" is often interpreted as a metaphor for fear or panic that God would instill in Israel's enemies, causing them to flee or be easily defeated. In the ancient Near East, hornets were known for their aggressive nature, and their sting could be deadly. This imagery underscores God's power and the certainty of His promises. The use of natural elements as instruments of God's will is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 8-11). Theologically, this demonstrates God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to use it for His purposes.<p><b>until even the survivors hiding from you have perished</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the completeness of God's judgment against the Canaanites. The term "survivors hiding" suggests that even those who attempt to escape God's judgment will not succeed. This reflects the thoroughness of God's plan and His commitment to fulfilling His promises to Israel. Historically, the Canaanites were known for their fortified cities and strategic hiding places, yet this verse assures Israel of total victory. This concept of complete divine judgment is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the destruction of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15). It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as described in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to fight for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being prepared to enter and possess the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the Promised Land, whom God has commanded the Israelites to drive out.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hornet.htm">Hornet</a></b><br>A divine instrument of God's judgment, symbolizing His power to drive out Israel's enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all creation, including nature, and can use any means to accomplish His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_assistance_in_spiritual_battles.htm">Divine Assistance in Spiritual Battles</a></b><br>Just as God promised to fight for Israel, He promises to be with us in our spiritual battles today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>The Israelites were called to trust in God's promises and His methods, even when they seemed unusual or unexpected.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_covenant.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Covenant</a></b><br>God's actions in sending the hornet demonstrate His faithfulness to His covenant with Israel, reminding us of His faithfulness to His promises to us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' success depended on their obedience to God's commands, highlighting the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_7_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 7:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_7_20_God_s_power_over_enemies_today.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:20 demonstrate God's power in overcoming our enemies today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Hornets_role_in_Israel_s_divine_victory.htm">What role do "hornets" play in God's plan for Israel's victory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_ways_in_tough_times.htm">How can we trust God's methods when facing overwhelming challenges in life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_7_20_to_God_s_deliverance.htm">Connect Deuteronomy 7:20 with other instances of God's deliverance in Scripture.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Using_divine_help_in_spiritual_fights.htm">How can we apply the principle of divine intervention in our spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Deut_7_20_show_God_s_use_of_nature.htm">What does Deuteronomy 7:20 reveal about God's use of natural forces for His purposes?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_7_20_divine_intervention_link.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:20 align with the concept of divine intervention in human affairs?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Deuteronomy_7_20_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Deuteronomy 7:20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_hornets.htm">What does the Bible mention about hornets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_'the_hornet'_align_with_history.htm">Joshua 24:12 &#8211; How does the account of God sending &#8220;the hornet&#8221; align with historical or natural evidence of plagues or insects driving out inhabitants? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_god_command_genocide.htm">Did God order genocide?
