In Israel, the law provided protection for escaped slaves, emphasizing compassion and justice. This principle aligns with the broader biblical theme of liberation and God's concern for the oppressed, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God delivers the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The command also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of spiritual freedom in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where believers are called to stand firm in their freedom and not be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.<p><b>if he has taken refuge with you</b><br>The phrase suggests a scenario where a slave seeks asylum, indicating a desperate situation where the slave is fleeing from harsh treatment or seeking a better life. The concept of refuge is significant throughout Scripture, often associated with God's protection and care for those in distress. This mirrors the cities of refuge established in Israel for those seeking protection from avengers (<a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-15</a>). The idea of refuge is also a type of Christ, who offers ultimate refuge and salvation to all who come to Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). The provision for a slave to find refuge in Israel underscores the nation's call to be a light to the nations, demonstrating God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slave.htm">Slave</a></b><br>A person who has escaped from their master and seeks refuge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The owner from whom the slave has fled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter and where these laws will be applied.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_human_dignity.htm">Value of Human Dignity</a></b><br>The command not to return a runaway slave underscores the importance of human dignity and freedom.
