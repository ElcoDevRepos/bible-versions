In biblical teaching, the heart is often seen as the center of moral and spiritual life (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The warning here is against allowing selfishness and greed to take root, which can lead to sinful actions. Jesus also taught about the significance of the heart in <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>, where evil thoughts are said to originate.<p><b>&#8220;The seventh year, the year of release, is near,&#8221;</b><br>The seventh year refers to the Sabbatical Year, a time when debts were to be forgiven (<a href="/deuteronomy/15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-2</a>). This practice was part of the Mosaic Law, designed to prevent the accumulation of debt and ensure economic balance within the community. It reflects God's concern for social justice and care for the poor. The concept of release foreshadows the ultimate release from sin through Christ (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<p><b>so that you look upon your poor brother begrudgingly and give him nothing.</b><br>This phrase addresses the temptation to withhold generosity due to the impending debt release. The term "poor brother" highlights the familial relationship among the Israelites, emphasizing communal responsibility. The law encouraged generosity and care for the needy (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>). Jesus reinforced this principle in the New Testament, teaching that whatever is done for the least of His brothers is done for Him (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><b>He will cry out to the LORD against you,</b><br>The cry of the oppressed reaching God is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). It underscores God's attentiveness to the plight of the poor and His role as their defender. This serves as a warning that God hears and responds to injustice, aligning with His character as a just and righteous judge (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><b>and you will be guilty of sin.</b><br>The consequence of ignoring the needs of the poor is clearly stated as sin. This reflects the biblical principle that sin is not only about actions but also about failing to act righteously (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>). The law was given to guide the Israelites in living a life pleasing to God, and failure to adhere to it resulted in guilt. This points to the need for a savior, as all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), fulfilled in Jesus Christ who offers forgiveness and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, receiving the laws and commandments as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventh_year.htm">The Seventh Year (Year of Release)</a></b><br>- A sabbatical year in which debts were to be forgiven, reflecting God's provision and mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_brother.htm">The Poor Brother</a></b><br>- Represents those in need within the community, whom God commands to be treated with compassion and generosity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>- The ultimate judge and authority, to whom the poor may appeal if wronged.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_heart_against_selfishness.htm">Guard Your Heart Against Selfishness</a></b><br>The verse warns against harboring wicked thoughts that prioritize self-interest over obedience to God's commands.
