It emphasizes the importance of family structure and respect within the household. In ancient Israelite society, the family was the basic unit of community and religious life. Honoring parents was seen as foundational to maintaining social order and covenantal faithfulness. This commandment is reiterated in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2-3</a>), highlighting its enduring significance.<p><b>as the LORD your God has commanded you</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority behind the commandment. It is not merely a social or cultural norm but a directive from God Himself. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminding the Israelites of their unique identity as God's chosen people. This commandment is part of the covenant stipulations that define Israel's relationship with God.<p><b>so that your days may be long</b><br>This promise of longevity is a common motif in wisdom literature, where obedience to God's commandments is associated with life and prosperity (<a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, long life was considered a sign of divine favor and blessing. This phrase suggests that honoring one's parents is not only a moral duty but also a means of securing God's blessing.<p><b>and that it may go well with you</b><br>This part of the verse connects obedience to well-being, implying that societal harmony and personal prosperity are linked to the respect and honor given to parents. The well-being mentioned here can be understood as both material and spiritual, reflecting the holistic nature of God's blessings.<p><b>in the land that the LORD your God is giving you</b><br>This phrase situates the commandment within the context of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. The land is a central theme in Deuteronomy, representing God's promise and the fulfillment of His covenant with Abraham. The commandment to honor parents is tied to the Israelites' future in the land, suggesting that their success and stability in the land depend on their adherence to God's laws. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the Kingdom of God, where obedience to God's commandments is linked to spiritual inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who delivered God's commandments to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the Law as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God originally gave the Ten Commandments to Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who commands His people to honor their parents.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_honor.htm">The Importance of Honor</a></b><br>Honoring parents is foundational to a godly life and reflects our respect for God's authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_blessing.htm">Promise of Blessing</a></b><br>The commandment comes with a promise of well-being and longevity, showing God's desire for our flourishing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_relevance.htm">Cultural Relevance</a></b><br>In a culture that often devalues family structures, this commandment calls Christians to uphold and respect family roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_legacy.htm">Spiritual Legacy</a></b><br>Honoring parents is part of passing down a spiritual legacy, teaching the next generation about God's faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_obedience.htm">Practical Obedience</a></b><br>This commandment calls for practical expressions of respect, care, and obedience to parents.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_5_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 5:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_5_16_Importance_of_honoring_parents.htm">How does Deuteronomy 5:16 emphasize the importance of honoring parents in society?

Jesus underscored this command when He rebuked the Pharisees for dodging care of parents by religious loopholes (<a href="/mark/7-9.htm">Mark 7:9&#8211;13</a>). Paul echoes it: &#8220;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1</a>). Because Scripture speaks with perfect reliability, we take this charge at face value: honoring parents is not optional; it is God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD your God has commanded you</b><p>&#8226; The source of the directive is the covenant-making LORD; human authority flows from His divine authority. <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a> records the same wording, showing continuity between Sinai and the plains of Moab. <a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm">Leviticus 19:3</a> places parental honor alongside Sabbath keeping, revealing how seriously God values family order. When we honor parents, we are first honoring the God who placed them over us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that your days may be long</b><p>&#8226; God attaches a promise: longevity. <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2&#8211;3</a> calls this &#8220;the first commandment with a promise,&#8221; carrying it straight from Torah into church life. <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1&#8211;2</a> likewise links obedient listening to &#8220;many days and years of life.&#8221; The promise is not a mechanical guarantee but a general principle: societies and individuals that cultivate respect for parents enjoy stability and duration, while those that dismantle parental honor shorten their own future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that it may go well with you</b><p>&#8226; The command guards not just length of life but quality of life. <a href="/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10&#8211;12</a> shows that obedience to wise instruction broadens the path and removes stumbling. <a href="/colossians/3-20.htm">Colossians 3:20</a> adds, &#8220;Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord&#8221;. When the Lord is pleased, His favor rests on the household&#8212;peace, provision, and protection follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land that the LORD your God is giving you</b><p>&#8226; For Israel, the blessing was tied to Canaan&#8212;the tangible stage for covenant life (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-8.htm">Deuteronomy 11:8&#8211;9</a>). Disrespect for parents would erode national stability and invite exile (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-41.htm">Deuteronomy 28:41</a>). For believers today, the principle extends to every sphere God entrusts&#8212;homes, churches, communities, even the ultimate inheritance kept in heaven (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). Honoring parents aligns us with God&#8217;s kingdom order wherever He plants us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>This verse unites command and promise. God Himself tells us to treat father and mother with lifelong honor. In doing so, we align with His authority, secure extended and enriched life, and enjoy His blessing in the place He assigns us. The pathway to a flourishing future, both personal and communal, still runs through the front door of parental honor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">That it may go well with thee . . .</span>--In this form St. Paul cites the commandment in the Epistle to the Ephesians (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/6-2.htm" title="That you might fear the LORD your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.">Deuteronomy 6:2-3</a>).
