The Israelites are reminded that it is the LORD who is actively driving out the nations, not their own strength or strategy. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate deliverer. The historical context here is the conquest of Canaan, a land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of Canaanite cities during this period, which were known for their fortified structures, indicating the formidable task that lay before the Israelites.<p><b>do not say in your heart, &#8220;Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land.&#8221;</b><br>This warning addresses the human tendency towards self-righteousness and pride. The Israelites are cautioned against attributing their success to their own moral superiority. This reflects a broader biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." Theologically, this underscores the doctrine of grace, where God's blessings are not earned by human merit but are acts of divine favor. The cultural context of the time often linked military success with divine favor, but this passage challenges that notion by focusing on God's purposes rather than human virtue.<p><b>Rather, the LORD is driving out these nations before you because of their wickedness.</b><br>This phrase highlights the justice of God in dealing with the Canaanite nations. The Canaanites were known for practices such as child sacrifice and idolatry, which were abominations in the sight of the LORD. This aligns with the biblical theme of divine judgment against sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where God tells Abraham that the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete, indicating a period of divine patience before judgment. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the seriousness with which He views sin. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers salvation from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being led into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is orchestrating the events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanite_nations.htm">The Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The nations currently inhabiting the Promised Land, known for their wickedness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's message to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God is sovereign in His decisions and actions.
