Bringing the accused to the door of her father's house underscores the public nature of the offense and the shame brought upon the family. This act also highlights the patriarchal structure of the society, where the father held significant responsibility for the conduct of his household. The door of the father's house is a place of judgment, similar to the city gates where elders would convene for legal matters (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>).<p><b>and there the men of her city will stone her to death</b><br>Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Israel, intended to serve as a communal act of justice and deterrence. The involvement of the men of the city indicates that the offense was not just against the family but against the community and its covenant with God. This communal participation in the execution reflects the collective responsibility to uphold the law and maintain purity within the community. Stoning is mentioned in other parts of the Old Testament as a punishment for various transgressions (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>).<p><b>For she has committed an outrage in Israel</b><br>The term "outrage" signifies a severe violation of social and religious norms. In the context of Israel, such an act was seen as a direct affront to the covenant relationship with God. The phrase emphasizes the gravity of the sin, not just as a personal failing but as a disruption to the holiness and order that God commanded for His people. This reflects the broader biblical theme of Israel as a chosen nation called to be holy and set apart (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><b>by being promiscuous in her father&#8217;s house</b><br>This phrase highlights the expectation of sexual purity and the importance of maintaining family honor. The father's house is symbolic of the protection and authority under which a daughter was expected to remain chaste until marriage. Promiscuity was seen as a breach of this trust and a dishonor to the family, reflecting the cultural and religious emphasis on sexual morality. This expectation is consistent with other biblical teachings on sexual conduct (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>).<p><b>So you must purge the evil from among you</b><br>The command to purge evil underscores the necessity of maintaining the community's holiness and obedience to God's laws. This phrase is repeated throughout Deuteronomy as a directive to remove sin and its influence from the community (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5, 17</a>:7). It reflects the seriousness with which God views sin and the need for His people to actively uphold righteousness. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to separate themselves from sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_woman.htm">The Young Woman</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, accused of promiscuity while in her father's house.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father's_house.htm">The Father&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The location where the judgment is carried out, symbolizing the family&#8217;s honor and the community's moral standards.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community_of_israel.htm">The Community of Israel</a></b><br>The broader society that enforces the law to maintain purity and holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_and_judges.htm">The Elders and Judges</a></b><br>Though not explicitly mentioned in this verse, they are the ones responsible for carrying out the law and ensuring justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_stoning.htm">The Act of Stoning</a></b><br>A severe form of capital punishment used to remove evil from the community and serve as a deterrent.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>This passage underscores the gravity of sin, particularly sexual immorality, and its impact on the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The community is responsible for upholding God's standards and ensuring that sin is addressed and not tolerated.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_justice_and_mercy.htm">The Role of Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>While the law demands justice, the New Testament introduces the balance of mercy and forgiveness through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purity_and_holiness.htm">Purity and Holiness</a></b><br>Believers are called to live lives of purity, reflecting God's holiness in their personal and communal lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_application.htm">Cultural Context and Application</a></b><br>Understanding the cultural and historical context of this law helps us apply its principles in a way that aligns with the teachings of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_22_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 22:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_22_21_on_God_s_view_of_purity.htm">How does Deuteronomy 22:21 reflect God's view on sexual purity and holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Cultural_roots_of_Deut_22_21_laws.htm">What cultural practices influenced the laws in Deuteronomy 22:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_22_21_today.htm">How can we apply Deuteronomy 22:21's principles to modern Christian living?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_teachings_on_purity_like_Deut_22_21.htm">What New Testament teachings align with Deuteronomy 22:21's emphasis on purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_22_21_s_impact_on_morals.htm">How does understanding Deuteronomy 22:21 deepen our respect for biblical moral standards?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_22_21_vs_modern_justice_morality.htm">How does Deuteronomy 22:21 align with modern views on justice and morality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_harsh_punishment_in_Deut_22_21.htm">What historical context explains the harsh punishment in Deuteronomy 22:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Modern_view_on_Deut_22_21_for_Christians.htm">How should Christians interpret Deuteronomy 22:21 in today's society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_faith.htm">Does the Bible mandate stoning non-virgins?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_happened_to_the_levite's_concubine.htm">What happened to the Levite's concubine in Gibeah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_deut._22's_virginity_tokens_clash_with_modern_anatomy.htm">How do the &#8220;tokens of virginity&#8221;

It conveys God&#8217;s holiness and the seriousness of sexual sin that misrepresents covenant faithfulness (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus alludes to this very law when confronted with the woman caught in adultery, revealing both the law&#8217;s validity and His authority to offer mercy (<a href="/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Outrage&#8221; signals a covenant-breaking act that offends God and harms society (<a href="/judges/20-6.htm">Judges 20:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Sexual purity was a sign of Israel&#8217;s distinction from pagan nations (<a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Her promiscuity, concealed while still under her father&#8217;s roof, represented deliberate deception and contempt for God-given authority (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes the same moral gravity: &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality&#8230; your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So you must purge the evil from among you</b><p>&#8226; This refrain recurs throughout Deuteronomy (13:5; 17:12; 24:7) and lays out a principle of communal holiness.<p>&#8226; Removing the offender protected Israel from God&#8217;s judgment and from moral contagion (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-13</a>, where Paul applies the same principle to church discipline).<p>&#8226; While civil penalties differ today, the church still fulfills the command spiritually&#8212;calling sinners to repentance, and, if necessary, excluding unrepentant members to preserve the witness of Christ&#8217;s body (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a> literally describes Israel&#8217;s God-given procedure for dealing with concealed sexual immorality exposed at marriage. The father&#8217;s doorway highlights family responsibility; communal stoning displays the seriousness of covenant violation; the charge of &#8220;outrage&#8221; reveals that sexual sin is never private; and the mandate to &#8220;purge the evil&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s call to a holy, distinct people. While Christ has fulfilled the law&#8217;s penal demands, the moral principle remains: God&#8217;s people must guard purity, exercise loving discipline, and uphold the honor of His name in every generation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[she]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
