The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe, descendants of Esau, who became perennial enemies of Israel. Their attack on the Israelites is recorded in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>, where they ambushed the Israelites at Rephidim. This act of aggression was unprovoked and is seen as a direct challenge to God's protection over His people. The memory of this event is meant to instill vigilance and reliance on God for justice and protection.<p><b>along your way from Egypt</b><br>This phrase situates the event during the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, a foundational narrative for Israel's identity as God's chosen people. The journey from Egypt to the Promised Land was fraught with challenges, both external and internal. The Amalekites' attack occurred shortly after the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, a time when the Israelites were still vulnerable and adjusting to their newfound freedom. This context highlights the Amalekites' opportunistic nature and underscores the need for Israel to trust in God's provision and guidance. The journey from Egypt is symbolic of the Christian's spiritual journey from sin to salvation, with the Amalekites representing the spiritual battles believers face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that attacked the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt.

Them they were to overcome by force; wickedness was to be removed by the extinction of the wicked. Moses has already repeatedly reminded the Israelites that they had utterly to destroy the wicked nations of Canaan; and he here closes this discourse by reminding them that there was a nation outside of Canaan which was also doomed, and which they were to root out. This was Amalek, which had attacked the Israelites in their journey at Rephidim, and had taken advantage of their exhausted condition to harass their rear and destroy those who, faint and weary, had lagged behind. For this they had been already punished by the Israelites, who, led on by Joshua, had turned upon them and discomfited them with the edge of the sword. This, however, was not enough; Amalek was to be utterly destroyed, and this the Israelites were to effect as soon as the Lord had given them rest in the Promised Land. It was not, however, till the time of David that this was done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Remember</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1429;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Amalekites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1425;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6002.htm">Strong's 6002: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amalek -- a descendant of Esau, also his posterity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">along your way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(bad&#183;de&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Egypt,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 25:17 Remember what Amalek did to you (Deut.
