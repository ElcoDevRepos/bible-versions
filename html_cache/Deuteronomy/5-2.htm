It highlights the covenantal nature of God's relationship with His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The use of "our" signifies a collective identity and shared faith among the Israelites. This is consistent with the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, which calls for the recognition of the LORD as the one true God.<p><b>made a covenant</b><br>A covenant in biblical terms is a solemn agreement between God and His people, often involving promises and obligations. This particular covenant at Horeb is a reaffirmation of the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it includes the giving of the Law. Covenants are central to the biblical narrative, with the New Covenant in Christ being the fulfillment of these Old Testament covenants (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p><b>with us</b><br>The phrase "with us" underscores the communal aspect of the covenant. It was not just with the leaders or a select few, but with the entire nation of Israel. This inclusivity is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's promises and laws are meant for all His people. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that the Gospel is for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>at Horeb</b><br>Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. This location is significant as it is where God revealed Himself in a powerful way, giving the Law that would guide the Israelites. The events at Horeb are foundational for understanding Israel's identity and mission. Geographically, Horeb is located in the Sinai Peninsula, and its exact location is debated, but it is traditionally associated with the southern part of the peninsula. The giving of the Law at Horeb is a type of Christ, who fulfills the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God of Israel, who is central to the account of the Old Testament.
