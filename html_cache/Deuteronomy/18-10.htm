The act of sacrificing children, often to the god Molech, was strictly forbidden by God (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). This command underscores the sanctity of life and the distinctiveness of Israel as a people set apart for God. The prohibition reflects God's character as a loving and just deity who abhors such cruelty. The practice is also a stark contrast to the faith of Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice Isaac but was stopped by God, highlighting that God does not desire human sacrifice (Genesis 22).<p><b>practices divination or conjury</b><br>Divination and conjury refer to attempts to gain insight or predict the future through supernatural means, often involving rituals or the consultation of spirits. These practices were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures and were used to seek guidance or favor from the gods. However, God explicitly forbids these practices for His people, as they demonstrate a lack of trust in His sovereignty and provision. Instead, God provided prophets to communicate His will (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-22</a>). The reliance on divination is seen as a form of idolatry, turning away from the true God to seek knowledge from false sources.<p><b>interprets omens</b><br>Interpreting omens involves reading signs or events as indicators of future occurrences. This practice was widespread in ancient cultures, where people looked to natural phenomena or unusual occurrences for guidance. The Bible consistently warns against such practices, as they can lead to superstition and distract from faith in God. In contrast, God calls His people to rely on His word and promises. The rejection of omen interpretation is part of a broader call to trust in God's revealed will rather than human speculation or manipulation of spiritual forces.<p><b>practices sorcery</b><br>Sorcery involves the use of magic or supernatural powers to influence events or people. It often includes the use of spells, charms, or rituals to harness spiritual forces. In the biblical context, sorcery is condemned because it represents a reliance on powers other than God and often involves invoking demonic forces. The New Testament continues this prohibition, with sorcery listed among the works of the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) and those who practice it being excluded from the kingdom of God (<a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>). The rejection of sorcery emphasizes the call to worship and depend solely on God, who is the ultimate source of power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

It is sometimes said that the verb of which this word is a part (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, a serpent; whence it is inferred that the species of divination indicated by this word is <span class="accented">ophiomancy</span>, or divination by serpents, but this is not generally accepted by scholars. <span class="cmt_word">A witch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">maleficus</span>); probably one who pretended to cure diseases, or procure some desired result, by means of nostrums and philtres. In the enumeration of the wise men of Babylon (<a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), the Mecashephim have a place beside the Hartummim, and in <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a> and <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, they are joined with the Hachamim or Magi of Egypt; and this favors the conclusion that their sorcery had a quasi-scientific basis. The English word "witch" is now restricted to the <span class="accented">female</span> practicer of unlawful arts; formerly it was applied to <span class="accented">males</span> as well, if not chiefly (Trench, 'Select Glossary,' p. 806). <span class="cmt_word">A charmer</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>); a dealer in spells, one who by means of spells or charms pretends to achieve some desired result. The verb here used primarily means to bind, and the species of magic indicated is probably that practiced by binding certain knots, whereby it was supposed that the curse or blessing, as the case might he, was bound on its object; this was accompanied apparently with incantation (<a href="/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>). Comp. English <span class="accented">spell-bound</span>, and the phrase, "to rivet charms" (Jonson, 'Sad Shepherd,' 2:2). A species of incantation known to the Romans consisted in tying knots with threads of different colors, three in number, which were supposed to become a bond to secure an object (cf. Virg., 'Eclog.' 8:76, 77). <span class="cmt_word">A consulter with familiar spirits.</span> This phrase conveys something different from what is expressed, in the Hebrew. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> is one who asks or inquires of an Ob, that is, a Python, or divining spirit. This spirit was supposed to be in the person of the conjurer, and to be able to reveal to him what was secret or hidden in the future (<a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7, 8</a>; <a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>). The notion of "a familiar spirit," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a spirit not dwelling in the person, but with which he is intimate - generally the spirit of one who formerly lived on earth - is a modern notion not known to Scripture. The persons here referred to were probably ventriloquists (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and used their faculty in this respect for purposes of magic, pretending that they had within them a spirit which they could consult, and by which they could predict what would happen or reveal what was hid. <span class="cmt_word">Wizard</span>. The English word "wizard" did not originally convey the idea of anything evil in the person of whom it was used; Milton applies it to the Magi who came to worship at Bethlehem ('Ode on the Nativity,' 4.); it meant merely "the wise one," or "the knowing one;" and thus is an exact equivalent for the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, knowing, wise, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to know). <span class="cmt_word">A necromancer</span>; one who professed to call up the dead, and from them to learn the secrets of futurity (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>). (See on all these names the learned and copious dissertation of Dr. Holmes, art. 'Divination,' in Kitto's 'Bibl. Cyclop.,' 3rd. edit., 1:682.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let no one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be found</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">among you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
