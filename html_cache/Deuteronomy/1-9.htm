This time frame is crucial as it sets the stage for the leadership structure that Moses is about to establish.<p><b>I said to you</b><br>Moses is addressing the Israelites, reminding them of his previous words. This reflects the oral tradition of passing down important teachings and decisions. Moses often used direct communication to convey God's commands and guidance, emphasizing the importance of listening to and remembering God's instructions.<p><b>I cannot carry the burden for you alone</b><br>Moses acknowledges the immense responsibility of leading a large and diverse group of people. This statement reflects the practical challenges of leadership and governance. It also points to the need for shared leadership, which is later addressed by appointing judges and leaders from among the tribes (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>). This concept of shared leadership is echoed in the New Testament, where the apostles appoint deacons to help with the growing needs of the early church (<a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>).

These last received the gift of prophecy, and were thus enabled to relieve Moses from some of the higher responsibilities of his office by representing his mind and reproducing his personal influence in many parts of the camp at once. Jethro's advice was given on their first arrival in Horeb: when it was carried into effect we are not told. The seventy elder were appointed (Numbers 11) between Sinai and Kadesh-barnea, shortly after they left Sinai. It is quite possible that both institutions came into existence at the same time. The seventy elders would have been of great service in the selection of the numerous judges and officers who were required.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">I am not able to bear you myself alone.</span>--Repeated almost exactly from <a href="/numbers/11-14.htm" title="I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.">Numbers 11:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-18.</span> - Moses reminds them that he had done all that was required on his part to conduct the people to the enjoyment of what God had freely given to them. The people had so increased in number that Moses found himself unable to attend to all the matters that concerned them, or to adjudicate in all the differences that arose among them. God had brought to pass that which he had promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; in this Moses rejoiced, nay, he would even that their numbers were, with the Divine blessing, increased a thousandfold beyond what they were. But he found the burden, the weight of care and trouble, especially in connection with their strifes and suits thereby brought on him, too much for him; and, therefore, whilst they were still at Horeb, he had, following the advice of Jethro, his father-in-law, counseled them to select competent men from among themselves, who should relieve him by attending to those duties which he found it too burdensome for him to have to attend to (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>, etc.). This appointment of captains was quite distinct from that of the elders whom God directed Moses to select that they might assist him in bearing the burden of the people (<a href="/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a>, etc.). The occasion of the appointment was the same in both cases, viz. the complaint of Moses that the task was too onerous for him, but the time, the place, and the manner of the two transactions were different. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I spake unto you at that time.</span> The somewhat indefinite phrase, "at that time" (comp. <a href="/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>), does not refer to the time <span class="accented">after</span> the people departed from Horeb, but to the time generally when they were in that region (see <a href="/exodus/18-5.htm">Exodus 18:5, 13</a>). "The imperfect (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, I spake), with <span class="accented">yaw</span> tel. expresses the order of thought and not of time" (Keil). It is not mentioned in Exodus that Moses spake to the people, as here stated, but what Jethro said to him to this effect is recorded; and as Moses proceeded to put in execution what his lather-in-law advised, it is probable that in doing so he told the people what he proposed to do, with his reasons for so doing, and obtained their assent, as here mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;hi&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6256.htm">Strong's 6256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Time, now, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1499;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;I cannot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">carry the burden</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">alone.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;ad&#183;d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_905.htm">Strong's 905: </a> </span><span class="str2">Separation, a part of the body, branch of a, tree, bar for, carrying, chief of</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 1:9 I spoke to you at that time (Deut.
