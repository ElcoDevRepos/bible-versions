It refers to the period after the Israelites' idolatry with the golden calf, as described in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. The LORD's communication with Moses highlights the ongoing relationship and covenant between God and His chosen leader. This divine instruction underscores God's willingness to renew the covenant despite Israel's previous disobedience.<p><b>Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals</b><br>The original tablets, inscribed by God, were broken by Moses in anger (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) when he saw the Israelites worshiping the golden calf. The command to chisel new tablets signifies God's grace and the restoration of the covenant. Stone tablets symbolize permanence and the enduring nature of God's law. This act prefigures the new covenant written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>come up to Me on the mountain</b><br>The mountain, likely Mount Sinai, is a place of divine revelation and encounter. It is where Moses previously received the Law (Exodus 19-20). Mountains in biblical literature often represent places of closeness to God and spiritual significance. This ascent signifies Moses' role as mediator between God and Israel, a type of Christ who mediates the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>).<p><b>and make an ark of wood</b><br>The ark, later known as the Ark of the Covenant, was to house the stone tablets. Made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>), it symbolizes God's presence among His people. The ark's construction from wood points to the humanity of Christ, while its gold overlay signifies His divinity.

Rashi, the Jewish commentator, thinks there were two arks: one to go out to war, and the other to remain in the tabernacle. But there is no foundation for this statement. There may, of course, have been a temporary receptacle for the tables made by Moses (like the temporary tabernacle mentioned in <a href="/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7</a>), to receive them until the completion of the ark which Bezaleel was to make. This was not put in hand until after Moses descended with the second pair of tables.
