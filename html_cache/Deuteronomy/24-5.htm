The emphasis on a newly married man highlights the importance of establishing a strong foundation for the marriage. This period allowed the couple to bond and set the tone for their future together. The concept of marriage as a covenant is echoed in <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>, where marriage is described as a covenant before God.<p><b>he must not be sent to war</b><br>This provision underscores the value placed on family and the sanctity of marriage. By exempting a newly married man from military service, the law prioritizes the stability and growth of the family unit. This reflects God's design for marriage as a source of support and companionship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, where God declares it is not good for man to be alone.<p><b>or be pressed into any duty</b><br>The exemption from other duties further emphasizes the importance of the marital relationship. It allowed the husband to focus entirely on his new wife, ensuring that their relationship was nurtured without external pressures. This principle of prioritizing family can be seen in the New Testament, where Paul advises believers to care for their families (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p><b>For one year he is free to stay at home</b><br>The one-year period provided a significant amount of time for the couple to adjust to their new life together. This time was crucial for building a strong, lasting relationship. The idea of rest and focus on family is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the Sabbath rest commanded in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, which emphasizes the importance of rest and relationship with God and family.<p><b>and bring joy to the wife he has married</b><br>The husband's role in bringing joy to his wife highlights the biblical principle of love and care within marriage. <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-28</a> instructs husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church, emphasizing sacrificial love and care.
