In the context of Deuteronomy, the Israelites are warned against idolatry and forming alliances with pagan nations. Hatred towards God is demonstrated through disobedience and the worship of other gods. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where love for God is shown through obedience to His commandments (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>He repays to their faces with destruction</b><br>The direct repayment signifies God's justice and the certainty of His judgment. In the ancient Near Eastern context, "to their faces" implies a personal and unmistakable confrontation. This reflects the principle of divine retribution found throughout the Bible, where God holds individuals accountable for their actions (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). The destruction mentioned is both physical and spiritual, as seen in the fate of nations like the Canaanites, who were judged for their wickedness.<p><b>He will not hesitate to repay</b><br>This emphasizes God's unwavering commitment to justice. Unlike human judges who may delay or be swayed, God's judgment is prompt and assured. The certainty of divine retribution is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God promises to act against those who oppose Him (<a href="/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>). This also serves as a warning to the Israelites to remain faithful and avoid the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>to his face the one who hates Him</b><br>The repetition underscores the personal nature of God's judgment. It is not an abstract or distant act but a direct response to personal rebellion against Him. This personal accountability is mirrored in the New Testament, where each individual must stand before God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).
