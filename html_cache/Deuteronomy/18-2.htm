This was a unique arrangement that underscored their special role in the religious life of Israel. The absence of a land inheritance is significant because it highlights their dependence on God and the community for sustenance. This arrangement is first mentioned in <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>, where God explains that He is their portion and inheritance. The Levites were supported through the tithes and offerings of the people, which allowed them to focus on their duties in the tabernacle and later the temple. This system emphasized the importance of spiritual service over material possession.<p><b>the LORD is their inheritance</b><br>This phrase signifies a profound spiritual truth: the Levites' inheritance was not material but spiritual. God Himself was their portion, which elevated their status and role within the community. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>, where David declares, "The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup." The idea of God being one's inheritance points to a relationship of trust and reliance on divine provision. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that believers are a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), with God as their ultimate reward and inheritance. This spiritual inheritance is a type of the eternal inheritance promised to all believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.<p><b>as He promised them</b><br>The promise of God being the inheritance of the Levites is rooted in His covenantal faithfulness. This promise is part of the broader covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where God repeatedly assures His people of His presence and provision. The fulfillment of this promise is seen throughout Israel's history, as the Levites were continually provided for through the tithes and offerings of the people. This assurance of God's provision is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting His unchanging nature and faithfulness to His word. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises in Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of a new covenant, ensuring that all believers have a secure inheritance in Him (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service to God.

This absence of farmland and real estate forced them to rely on God&#8217;s provision through tithes and offerings brought by the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrangement underscored that their primary identity was not rooted in land ownership but in ministry at the tabernacle (later the temple).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD is their inheritance</b><p>&#8226; Instead of acres and borders, the Levites received something far greater: &#8220;the LORD Himself.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a> echoes this theme&#8212;&#8220;The LORD is my portion and my cup; You maintain my lot.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practical expressions of this inheritance included:<p>&#8211; Access to serve in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/numbers/8-14.htm">Numbers 8:14&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8211; A share in the offerings (<a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8211; Cities scattered throughout Israel, ensuring spiritual influence in every region (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, God pledged to satisfy and sustain them personally, reinforcing that genuine security comes from Him, not possessions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as He promised them</b><p>&#8226; The promise traces back to Sinai, where God declared the Levites &#8220;Mine&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a>).<p>&#8226; It is repeated consistently: &#8220;I am your share and your inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to keep this word models how He fulfills every covenant, foreshadowing the believer&#8217;s inheritance in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The reliability of the promise also affirmed to Israel that setting apart an entire tribe for worship would never result in their neglect or poverty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The Levites&#8217; lack of land highlighted their distinctive calling: they would trade material inheritance for intimate service to God. In return, the LORD Himself became their portion, meeting every need and granting lasting security, exactly as He had pledged. The verse reminds believers that true inheritance is found not in earthly assets but in a faithful God who always keeps His promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he hath said unto them</span> (cf. <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the front leg, the two jaw-bones, and the rough stomach of ruminants, in which the digestion is completed. These were regarded as the choice parts of the animal, and were to be given to the priests in addition to the wave breast and heave leg of the peace offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>, etc.; <a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>), which belonged to the firings of Jehovah, mentioned in ver. 1.

"This right was probably accorded to the priests as a compensation for the falling off which would take place in their incomes in consequence of the repeal of the law that every animal was to be slaughtered at the sanctuary as a sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/17.htm">Leviticus 17</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>. <span class="accented">sqq</span>.)"(<span class="accented">Keil</span>). According to Josephus ('Antiq ,' 4:4, 4), Philo ('De Praemiis. Sacerdot.,' p. 832, Opp., tom. 2. p. 235, edit. Maugey), the Talmud, etc., this injunction relates to the slaying of animals at home for private use, and not such as were killed for sacrifice. But the use here of the sacrificial phraseology, <span class="cmt_word">who offer a sacrifice</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, who slay victims for sacrifice - a phrase nowhere found except in connection with sacrificial rites) is adverse to this; and besides, how could such an enactment be carried out? How could people, residing at a distance, convey to the priests the portions due to them every time they slaughtered an animal for domestic use? At the same time, the sacrifices here referred to do not seem to be included in the offerings by fire above mentioned; and these gifts to the priest seem to have been something over and above his ordinary dues. There is probability, therefore, in the suggestion that "the reference is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats, which were not intended for <span class="accented">shelamim</span> in the more limited sense, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for one of the three species of peace offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 16</a>), but for festal meals in the broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals prepared from the <span class="accented">shelamim"</span> (Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/18-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Although they have</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
