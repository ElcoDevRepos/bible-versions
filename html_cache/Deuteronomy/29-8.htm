These victories are recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-3</a>:11. The Israelites, under God's command, defeated these kings and took possession of their lands. This conquest was part of God's promise to give the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The taking of the land signifies God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and gave it as an inheritance</b><br>The land was not merely conquered but was distributed as an inheritance, indicating a permanent possession for the tribes of Israel. This reflects the biblical principle of land as a divine gift and a sign of God's covenant with His people. The concept of inheritance is significant in the Old Testament, symbolizing stability, identity, and God's provision. It also foreshadows the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.<p><b>to the Reubenites, the Gadites,</b><br>These tribes, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, requested to settle in the land east of the Jordan because it was suitable for their large herds and flocks (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). Moses granted their request on the condition that they assist the other tribes in conquering the land west of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20-22</a>). This allocation of land highlights the unity and cooperation required among the tribes, as well as the importance of fulfilling communal responsibilities.<p><b>and the half-tribe of Manasseh.</b><br>The half-tribe of Manasseh, descended from Joseph's son Manasseh, was divided, with one half settling east of the Jordan and the other half west. This division is detailed in <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a> and <a href="/joshua/17.htm">Joshua 17:1-6</a>. The allocation of land to the half-tribe of Manasseh demonstrates God's provision and the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph's sons in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19-20</a>. It also illustrates the complexity of tribal inheritance and the importance of maintaining family and tribal identities within the larger community of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites.htm">Reubenites</a></b><br>Descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Jacob.
