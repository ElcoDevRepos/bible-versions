In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is reminding the Israelites of their dependence on God as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. This call to remember is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, where the Israelites are warned not to forget the LORD who brought them out of Egypt. The emphasis on "the LORD your God" underscores the personal relationship between God and His people, a covenantal bond that is central to the identity of Israel.<p><b>who gives you the power to gain wealth,</b><br>The ability to gain wealth is presented as a gift from God, not merely the result of human effort or ingenuity. This reflects the biblical principle that all resources and abilities ultimately come from God, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>, where wealth and honor are said to come from Him. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often associated with divine favor, and this passage reinforces that idea by attributing the power to gain wealth directly to God. It serves as a reminder to the Israelites that their prosperity in the land is contingent upon God's provision.<p><b>in order to confirm His covenant</b><br>The wealth and prosperity given by God serve a greater purpose: to confirm His covenant. This covenant refers to the promises made to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;regarding the land, descendants, and blessings (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 15</a>:18-21). The confirmation of the covenant through material blessings is a tangible sign of God's faithfulness and commitment to His promises. It also serves as a reminder of the conditional nature of the covenant, which requires obedience and faithfulness from the Israelites.<p><b>that He swore to your fathers</b><br>This phrase connects the present generation of Israelites with their ancestors, highlighting the continuity of God's promises. The reference to "your fathers" points back to the patriarchs and the foundational covenants made with them. This historical context reinforces the idea that God's promises are enduring and reliable, transcending generations. It also serves as a call to the Israelites to live in a manner worthy of their heritage and the divine promises made to their forefathers.<p><b>even to this day.</b><br>The phrase "even to this day" underscores the ongoing relevance and fulfillment of God's covenant promises. It indicates that the covenant is not just a historical agreement but a living reality that continues to impact the lives of the Israelites. This continuity is a testament to God's unchanging nature and His steadfast love for His people. It also serves as a reminder that the blessings and responsibilities of the covenant are still applicable, urging the Israelites to remain faithful and obedient to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's message to the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being reminded of their dependence on God for their prosperity and success.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who provides for His people and fulfills His promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, a place of abundance and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_with_the_patriarchs.htm">Covenant with the Patriarchs</a></b><br>The promises made by God to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which include blessings and the inheritance of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_source_of_wealth.htm">Divine Source of Wealth</a></b><br>Recognize that all abilities and opportunities to gain wealth come from God.
