Moses, as the leader and prophet, communicated God's commands and guidance to the Israelites. The refusal to listen is a pattern seen throughout the wilderness journey, reflecting a deeper spiritual issue of hard-heartedness. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God calls for obedience to His voice. The failure to heed divine instruction often led to dire consequences, as seen in the broader narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>You rebelled against the command of the LORD</b><br>Rebellion against God's command is a serious offense, illustrating a willful defiance of divine authority. In the context of Deuteronomy, this rebellion refers to the Israelites' refusal to trust God's promise to give them the land of Canaan, as initially commanded in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>. This act of rebellion is not just a physical disobedience but a spiritual one, showing a lack of faith and trust in God's power and promises. The rebellion is a precursor to the many instances where Israel would turn away from God, leading to their eventual exile.<p><b>and presumptuously went up into the hill country.</b><br>The term "presumptuously" indicates acting with arrogance and self-reliance, ignoring God's clear instructions. The hill country refers to the region of Canaan, which the Israelites attempted to enter without God's blessing after initially refusing to go when commanded. This action is detailed in <a href="/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>, where the Israelites, after realizing their mistake, tried to take the land by their own strength, resulting in defeat. This presumption is a type of human pride that contrasts with the humility and obedience exemplified by Jesus Christ, who always submitted to the Father's will (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is recounting their journey and disobedience to God's commands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who gave commands and guidance to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hill_country.htm">Hill Country</a></b><br>The region the Israelites attempted to enter presumptuously, against God's command.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>The act of disobedience by the Israelites when they chose to go against God's directive.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial.
