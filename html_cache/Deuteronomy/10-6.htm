Beeroth Bene-jaakan and Moserah are locations mentioned in the context of the Israelites' 40-year journey in the desert. The name "Beeroth Bene-jaakan" means "wells of the sons of Jaakan," suggesting a place with water sources, which were crucial for survival in the desert. This journey reflects the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during this period and their reliance on God's guidance. The movement from one location to another signifies the ongoing fulfillment of God's promise to lead them to the Promised Land. This journey is also mentioned in <a href="/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31-33</a>, providing a cross-reference for further study.<p><b>where Aaron died and was buried</b><br>Aaron's death marks a significant transition in the leadership of Israel. As the first high priest, Aaron played a crucial role in establishing the priesthood and the sacrificial system. His death at Moserah signifies the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter for the Israelites. The location of his burial is significant as it underscores the transient nature of the Israelites' journey and the fulfillment of God's word that the older generation would not enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>). Aaron's death is also a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land due to his actions at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).<p><b>and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest</b><br>The succession of Eleazar as high priest represents the continuity of the priestly line and the faithfulness of God in maintaining the covenant with Israel. Eleazar's role as high priest is crucial for the spiritual leadership of the nation, as he would oversee the sacrificial system and intercede for the people. This transition also highlights the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the relationship between God and His people. Eleazar's succession is a fulfillment of the Levitical priesthood established by God, ensuring that the spiritual needs of the Israelites would continue to be met. This succession is a type of Christ, who is our eternal High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, emphasizing the continuity and fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beeroth_bene-jaakan.htm">Beeroth Bene-jaakan</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the Israelites' wilderness journey.

Each phrase invites trust: He guides each step, supplies every need, sustains leadership, and preserves covenant worship across generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6, 7) On these verses, which are among the most difficult in Deuteronomy, see a separate Excursus. The difficulty is two-fold. First, the account of Israel's marches about the time of Aaron's death is given in a different form here to that which we have in Numbers 20, 21, 33. Secondly, there is the further question why Aaron's death should be recorded here. It appears to have taken place before Moses began the delivery of the discourses in Deuteronomy. It is separated by thirty-nine years from the incidents which Moses is recapitulating in this passage. The Jewish commentator Rashi gives a very curious tale to account for the allusion to Aaron's death in this place. But though his theory is mythical, he seems to hit the main point, which is that Israel <span class= "ital">re-visited </span>in their journey round the land of Edom four places where they had previously encamped, and among them Mosera, or Moseroth, the district in which Mount Hor, where Aaron died, was situated. There is no impossibility in this; in fact, it is highly probable, and would partly account for the statement in <a href="/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a><span class= "ital">, </span>that "the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way." It was just about this time that the fiery serpents came.<p>If the connection of these verses with the train of thought in Moses' mind is <span class= "ital">spiritual, </span>the difficulty may be solved. <span class= "ital">The death of the priest of Israel, </span>whose first representative Aaron was, is spiritually identical with the destruction of the first pair of tables, the death of the first Adam and of all mankind in the person of our representative, the Lord Jesus Christ. After that death He "ariseth" as "another priest, made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life." Thus the incident is connected with what goes before. The separation of the tribe of Levi <span class= "ital">"</span>to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"to bear the burden of the Law," is the same thing in another form. It deprives them of an earthly inheritance, just as He whose representatives they were gave Himself an offering and sacrifice to God; and "His life is taken from the earth."<p>Further, the names of the places themselves have in this aspect a spiritual significance. From certain "wells of water"--the wells of the children of Jaakan (crookedness)--the people of God take their journey to the scene of the high priest's death. From thence to Hor-hagidgad, or Gudgodah, the mount of the "troop," or "band" (Sinai is the mount of the "congregation" in the Old Testament, Zion in the New), and thence to <span class= "ital">a land </span>of <span class= "ital">rivers of water. </span>It is only another way of relating how from the wells of the Law we pass to the rivers of living water opened by the Gospel. But we must pass <span class= "ital">by way of the cross of Christ.</span><p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS ON NOTES TO DEUTERONOMY.</span><p>EXCURSUS ON <a href="/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>.<p>THESE verses have always seemed to me to present the greatest difficulty in the whole of Deuteronomy. If it were not for their beautiful spiritual connection with the context, I should not know how to account for their presence in this place at all. And even so, the <span class= "ital">difference </span>between this allusion to Aaron's death and the account given in Numbers, and the superficial <span class= "ital">resemblance </span>between the four stages of the journey of Israel here mentioned, and four stages which belong to a different period (in <a href="/context/numbers/33-31.htm" title="And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.">Numbers 33:31-34</a>)--together create a somewhat formidable perplexity. The Samaritan Pentateuch increases the confusion by introducing here the stages mentioned in <a href="/context/numbers/33-34.htm" title="And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.">Numbers 33:34-37</a><a href="/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a> supports the Hebrew text. The fact that the <span class= "ital">burial </span>of <span class= "ital">Aaron is alluded to in this place only,</span> shows that the verses in Deuteronomy cannot have been taken from those in Numbers. The following comparison will show the difference. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Not only did God, of his grace and in response to the intercession of Moses, give to the people, notwithstanding their apostasy, the ark of the covenant with the new tables of the Law, but he followed this up by instituting the high priesthood; and, when Aaron died, caused it to be continued to his son Eleazar.

As Aaron died there, Mosera must have been in the vicinity of Mount Her. <span class="cmt_word">Gudgodah</span>, Hor-hagidgad (<a href="/numbers/33-32.htm">Numbers 33:32</a>); <span class="accented">cave of Gidgad</span>, a place of caves. Jotbath, <span class="cmt_word">Jotbathah</span> (<a href="/numbers/33-33.htm">Numbers 33:33</a>), a district abounding in streams, whence probably its name, <span class="accented">Jot-bathah</span>, pleasantness, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to be good, to please. None of these places have been identified. Robinson mentions a Wady cf. Ghadaghidh, a broad sandy valley diverging from the Wady es Jerafeh, in the desert of Et-Tih, and this has been supposed to indicate the site of Gudgodah; but the difference of the consonants in the two words is such as to render this identification more than doubtful. In the Arabic of the London Polyglott, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span> is represented by (<span class="accented">Judjuda</span>), which is totally different from <span class="accented">Ghadaghidh</span>. All the places, however, must have been in the 'Arabah, and in the region of Mount Her, or not far distant. That the places mentioned here are the same as those in Numbers cannot be doubted. The two passages, however, relate to different journeys; that in Numbers to the journeying of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai to Kadesh, that in Deuteronomy to the march in the fortieth year, when they went from Kadesh to Mount Her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
