The concept of being "God's people" is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), where God promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. This identity is central to Israel's understanding of themselves and their unique role in God's plan. The idea of being God's chosen people is reiterated throughout the Old Testament, including in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God calls Israel a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation."<p><b>Your inheritance</b><br>The term "inheritance" signifies a special possession or heritage. In the context of Israel, it refers to the land promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This inheritance is not just physical land but also a spiritual legacy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, where God describes Israel as His inheritance. The concept of inheritance also points forward to the New Testament, where believers in Christ are described as God's inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>).<p><b>whom You brought out</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, the defining moment of deliverance for Israel. The Exodus is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. It is frequently referenced as a reminder of God's ability to save and His commitment to His promises (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). The deliverance from Egypt is also a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus leads believers out of bondage to sin (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>, where the term "departure" is literally "exodus").<p><b>by Your great power</b><br>The "great power" of God is demonstrated through the miraculous events of the Exodus, including the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision in the wilderness. These acts reveal God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to intervene in human history. The power of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, underscoring His omnipotence and the assurance that nothing is too difficult for Him (<a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>).<p><b>and outstretched arm.</b><br>The "outstretched arm" is a metaphor for God's active involvement and strength in delivering His people. This imagery is used throughout the Old Testament to describe God's mighty acts (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>). It conveys the idea of God reaching down to rescue and protect His people. In the New Testament, this concept is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial death and resurrection are the ultimate demonstration of God's saving power (<a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is interceding on behalf of the people before God.
