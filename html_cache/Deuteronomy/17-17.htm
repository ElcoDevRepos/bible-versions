However, this commandment sets Israel apart, emphasizing the importance of monogamy and the potential spiritual dangers of multiple marriages. The warning against taking many wives is exemplified in the life of King Solomon, whose numerous marriages led him to idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). This directive underscores the importance of fidelity and the potential for divided loyalties, which can lead one's heart away from God. The ideal of monogamy is further reinforced in the New Testament, where marriage is depicted as a union between one man and one woman (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-33</a>).<p><b>lest his heart go astray</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's will and emotions. The warning here is that the king's heart could be led away from God through the influence of foreign wives, who might introduce pagan practices and beliefs. This is a caution against spiritual infidelity and the dangers of allowing personal relationships to compromise one's devotion to God. The heart's propensity to stray is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful. This phrase serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance in maintaining spiritual integrity.<p><b>He must not accumulate for himself large amounts of silver and gold</b><br>The accumulation of wealth is another potential pitfall for a king, as it can lead to pride, self-reliance, and a departure from trusting in God's provision. This commandment is a safeguard against the corrupting influence of wealth, which can lead to exploitation and injustice. The biblical narrative often contrasts the fleeting nature of earthly riches with the enduring value of spiritual treasures (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The prohibition against amassing wealth is also a call to humility and dependence on God, as seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who, though rich, became poor for the sake of humanity (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where leaders are advised to be free from the love of money (<a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the laws as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_israel.htm">Kings of Israel</a></b><br>The future leaders of Israel, for whom these specific instructions are given to ensure righteous leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter and where these laws will be applied.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and lawgiver, providing guidance for the well-being of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>The heart is susceptible to being led astray by desires and temptations.
