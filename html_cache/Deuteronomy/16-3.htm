Leaven, or yeast, is often symbolic of sin and corruption in the Bible (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The absence of leaven signifies purity and separation from sin. The Israelites were to remove all leaven from their homes, symbolizing a break from their past life in Egypt and a commitment to holiness.<p><b>for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread,</b><br>The seven-day period of eating unleavened bread is known as the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which immediately follows Passover. This feast is a time of reflection and purification, emphasizing the need for spiritual readiness and dedication to God. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible, indicating the thoroughness of this observance.<p><b>the bread of affliction,</b><br>Unleavened bread is called the "bread of affliction" because it reminds the Israelites of their suffering and hardship in Egypt. It is a tangible reminder of their past bondage and the miraculous deliverance by God. This term underscores the humility and dependence on God that the Israelites were to maintain.<p><b>because you left the land of Egypt in haste&#8212;</b><br>The haste with which the Israelites left Egypt is a critical aspect of the Exodus narrative. They had to leave quickly, without time for their bread to rise, symbolizing the urgency of God's deliverance. This haste also reflects the immediacy of God's intervention and the need for readiness to follow His commands without delay.<p><b>so that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the land of Egypt.</b><br>The act of remembrance is central to the Jewish faith and is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. This command ensures that each generation recalls God's faithfulness and power in delivering His people. It serves as a perpetual reminder of God's covenant and the identity of the Israelites as His chosen people.

Leaven (yeast) works silently but completely; once it is in the dough, the whole loaf is affected. In Scripture, the rising of leaven often pictures the spreading influence of sin and false teaching. &#8226; <a href="/exodus/34-25.htm">Exodus 34:25</a> reminds, &#8220;You are not to offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened,&#8221; underscoring God&#8217;s demand for purity in worship. &#8226; Paul applies the same picture to believers: &#8220;Get rid of the old yeast, that you may be a new batch&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). By forbidding leaven at Passover, God built a yearly object lesson: salvation starts with a clean break from the old life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread</b><p>The experience was not a one-time meal but an entire week. Seven days signal completeness, calling Israel to live out purity day after day. During that week:<p>&#8211; All leaven was cleared from every home (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Daily offerings highlighted continual fellowship with God (<a href="/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17-25</a>).<p>&#8211; Families ate the same flat bread at every meal, reinforcing the message each time they ate.<p>Jesus later warned, &#8220;Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>), showing that the principle of ongoing vigilance still applies. The weeklong practice teaches that a redeemed life is not momentary enthusiasm but steady, sustained devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the bread of affliction</b><p>Unleavened bread is called &#8220;the bread of affliction&#8221; because it links Israel to the hardship they endured under Pharaoh. It tasted plain, even harsh, compared with the soft loaves they might have enjoyed in settled times. <a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a> notes, &#8220;They baked unleavened cakes of the dough&#8230; because it had no leaven; for they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay.&#8221; Every bite carried the memory of oppression and God&#8217;s rescue. In <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a> the same wilderness generation is told that God &#8220;humbled you and allowed you to hunger,&#8221; using simple food to teach dependence. Affliction bread turns nostalgic fantasy about Egypt into a realistic reminder of slavery and grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you left the land of Egypt in haste</b><p>Haste marked the original night: sandals on feet, staff in hand, eating quickly (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>). The Egyptians &#8220;urged the people to hurry and leave the land&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-33.htm">Exodus 12:33</a>). There was no time to let dough rise. God&#8217;s redemption came suddenly, decisively, and Israel had to respond immediately. Centuries later, Stephen still highlighted that urgency in <a href="/acts/7-36.htm">Acts 7:36</a>. For believers today the picture is equally sharp: when God saves, He calls for prompt, wholehearted obedience, not gradual negotiations with sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the land of Egypt</b><p>Memory is the ultimate purpose. God intertwines history with worship so His people never forget Who delivered them. &#8226; <a href="/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a> instructs parents to explain the unleavened bread to their children, creating a living tradition. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a> celebrates, &#8220;He brought His people out with rejoicing.&#8221; &#8226; At the Last Supper Jesus drew on this same memorial pattern when He said, &#8220;Do this in remembrance of Me&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>). Just as Israel&#8217;s Passover fixed their eyes on the exodus, the Lord&#8217;s Supper fixes ours on the cross and empty tomb. Divine rescue must be recalled, retold, and relived so that gratitude shapes every future day.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a> sets out a vivid, multilayered command: remove leaven, eat unleavened bread for a week, call it the bread of affliction, and reenact the haste of the exodus&#8212;all so God&#8217;s people will never forget His mighty salvation. The text anchors purity, perseverance, humility, urgency, and remembrance in one simple food. By keeping this feast, Israel practiced a living testimony: they were once slaves, now free by the Lord&#8217;s strong hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bread of affliction</span>; bread such as is prepared in circumstances of trial and pressure, when there is no time or opportunity for the application of all the means required for the preparation of bread of the better sort. The Israelites had in haste and amid anxiety to prepare the Passover meal on the evening of their flight from Egypt, and so had to omit the leavening of their bread; and this usage they had to observe during the seven days of the festival in subsequent times, to remind them of the oppression the nation had suffered in Egypt, and the circumstances of difficulty and peril amidst which their deliverance had been effected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1463;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">leavened bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1428;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2557.htm">Strong's 2557: </a> </span><span class="str2">That which is leavened</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with it;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
