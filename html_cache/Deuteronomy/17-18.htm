The royal throne symbolizes the king's role as the leader of God's chosen people. In the historical context, Israel was unique among ancient nations in that their king was expected to rule under God's authority, not as an autonomous ruler. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where God was the ultimate king. The throne also foreshadows the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ, who is seated at the right hand of God (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><b>he must write for himself a copy of this instruction</b><br>The king was required to personally transcribe the law, emphasizing the importance of God's Word in guiding his reign. This act was meant to ensure that the king was intimately familiar with the law, promoting humility and obedience. The instruction refers to the Torah, particularly the book of Deuteronomy, which contains the covenantal laws given to Israel. This practice underscores the principle that leaders are not above the law but are subject to it, a concept that is echoed in the New Testament where Jesus fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>on a scroll</b><br>The use of a scroll indicates the ancient method of recording and preserving important texts. Scrolls were made from papyrus or parchment and were the primary means of documentation in the ancient Near East. This method of writing was labor-intensive, which further underscores the seriousness of the king's task. The scroll as a medium also connects to the prophetic imagery in Revelation, where scrolls are used to convey divine revelation (<a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>).<p><b>in the presence of the Levitical priests</b><br>The involvement of the Levitical priests highlights the religious and ceremonial aspect of this task. The priests served as custodians of the law and were responsible for teaching it to the people (<a href="/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>). Their presence ensured the accuracy and authenticity of the transcription, reinforcing the sacredness of the law. This requirement also points to the role of the priesthood in mediating between God and the people, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, our high priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>The verse refers to the king who would rule over Israel.

A king who starts here will rule with justice, humility, and covenant faithfulness; a king who ignores it will drift into tyranny and idolatry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">He shall write him a copy of this law.</span>--This phrase is the source of the Greek title of the book, <span class= "ital">Deuteronomion, </span>or in English, Deuteronomy. The word appears also in <a href="/joshua/8-32.htm" title="And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.">Joshua 8:32</a>. The English conveys the right sense of the word, which primarily denotes repetition. In Hebrew it is <span class= "ital">Mishneh, </span>the name afterwards given to the "text" of the Talmud, of which the idea is to repeat the law; though it is a somewhat peculiar repetition, in which <span class= "ital">minuti? </span>are chiefly dealt with, and weightier matters left out.<p>There are traces of this direction (1) in the coronation of Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-11.htm" title="Then they brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.">2Chronicles 23:11</a>, "they gave him the testimony;" (2) in the reign of Jehoshaphat, who had the Book of the Law taught to his people (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-9.htm" title="And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.">2Chronicles 17:9</a>); and (3) in the delivery of the book when discovered in the Temple to Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-18.htm" title="Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.

But it is singular that we do not hear of the Book of the Law in connection with David and Solomon. Possibly, as David was a prophet himself, and not only a king, it may be thought unnecessary to make special mention of his study of the law. In many things he acted upon the direct commands of God to himself or to his seers.<p>We must not forget that the true king of Israel is He whose special mission it was "to fulfil the law and the prophets."
