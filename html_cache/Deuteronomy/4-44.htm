It is not merely a set of rules but a comprehensive guide for living in covenant relationship with God. The law includes moral, ceremonial, and civil instructions, reflecting God's holiness and His desire for His people to be set apart. The law serves as a tutor leading to Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, pointing to the need for a Savior.<p><b>that Moses set</b><br>Moses is the central human figure in the giving of the law. As a prophet and leader, he acts as a mediator between God and the Israelites. His role is significant as he receives the law directly from God on Mount Sinai. Moses' leadership and faithfulness are highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>, where he is commended for his service in God's house. The setting of the law by Moses underscores the importance of divine authority and human obedience.<p><b>before the Israelites.</b><br>The Israelites are the chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They are called to be a holy nation and a kingdom of priests (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The giving of the law is a pivotal moment in their history, marking their identity as God's covenant people. The law is intended to guide them in the Promised Land, setting them apart from surrounding nations.
