In the ancient Near Eastern context, prophets were seen as intermediaries between the divine and human realms. The authority to speak in God's name was not to be taken lightly, as it implied divine endorsement. The Bible consistently warns against false prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>). The New Testament also cautions believers to test the spirits (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>).<p><b>that I have not commanded him to speak</b><br>This highlights the importance of divine command and authenticity. True prophecy originates from God, and any message not commanded by Him is considered false. This aligns with the biblical principle that God&#8217;s word is authoritative and unchanging (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). The role of a prophet was to convey God&#8217;s will, not personal opinions or desires.<p><b>or to speak in the name of other gods</b><br>This phrase underscores the exclusivity of worship and allegiance to Yahweh. In the historical context of Israel, surrounded by polytheistic cultures, the temptation to syncretize or adopt other deities was significant. The first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) explicitly forbids the worship of other gods, reinforcing the monotheistic foundation of Israelite faith.<p><b>that prophet must be put to death.</b><br>The prescribed penalty reflects the gravity of leading people away from the true God. In ancient Israel, maintaining the purity of worship and doctrine was crucial for the community's covenant relationship with God. This severe consequence served as a deterrent against false prophecy and idolatry. The New Testament, while not prescribing physical death, warns of spiritual death and judgment for false teachers (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that Christ will execute upon His return (<a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>A person who claims to speak on behalf of God.
