The term "corruptly" suggests moral decay and deviation from the path of righteousness. In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land, reminding them of their past failures and urging them to remain faithful. This corruption is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, and redemption throughout the history of Israel (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The corruption is not just a personal failing but a communal one, affecting the entire nation.<p><b>the blemish on them is not that of His children,</b><br>Here, the "blemish" indicates a moral or spiritual defect that separates the people from their identity as God's children. In biblical terms, being a child of God implies living in accordance with His will and reflecting His character. The Israelites' actions have marred this identity, suggesting a failure to live up to the standards set by God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be blameless and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation" (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The imagery of blemish also connects to the sacrificial system, where offerings to God were to be without defect, symbolizing purity and holiness (<a href="/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>).<p><b>but of a perverse and crooked generation.</b><br>The description of the generation as "perverse and crooked" underscores the severity of their deviation from God's ways. "Perverse" suggests a willful turning away from what is right, while "crooked" implies a distortion of truth and justice. This language is reminiscent of the prophetic rebukes found throughout the Old Testament, where prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah call out the moral and spiritual failings of the people (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21-25</a>). Jesus also uses similar language in the New Testament, referring to the people of His time as a "wicked and adulterous generation" (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>). This phrase serves as a warning and a call to repentance, urging the people to return to God and His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering his final messages to the Israelites before his death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whom Moses is addressing in this passage, reminding them of their covenant with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom the Israelites have acted corruptly, highlighting His holiness and righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination of the Israelites, which serves as the backdrop for Moses' warnings and teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites have wandered for 40 years, a period marked by rebellion and testing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_corruption.htm">Understanding Corruption</a></b><br>Recognize that corruption is a deviation from God's perfect standard.

After careful consideration of the passage with a learned Christian Hebrew,<span class= "note">[6]</span> I venture to propound this as the true translation. It is <span class= "ital">substantially </span>identical with that of the English margin. The Hebrew consists of five words only (1) "He-hath-corrupted (2) to-him (3) not (4) his-sons (5) their blemish." That the first two ought to be taken together, if the text is correct, seems certain. The same construction is found in <a href="/numbers/32-15.htm" title="For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.">Numbers 32:15</a>, "ye shall destroy all this people," and also in <a href="/1_samuel/23-10.htm" title="Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.">1Samuel 23:10</a>, "to destroy the city." As to the third and fourth words, we have thought that their true relation is the same which we find in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, a "not-God," and a "not-people," and also in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, <span class= "ital">"</span>not-wise." In like manner Israel are in this verse called "not-sons of His." Their not-sonship, their unfilial, undutiful, ungodly behaviour to Him who is the perfection of truth and sincerity, a very Rock of fidelity to them, that is their great blemish. He has said, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn." But all Israel's behaviour gives Him the lie. The contrast between the two descriptions--the faithful God of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, and the unfaithful children of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>--is the cardinal point in the verse. In the form of the expression, <span class= "ital">lo</span>-<span class= "ital">banav </span>is strictly parallel to the <span class= "ital">Lo-ammi </span>of <a href="/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>. The "<span class= "ital">froward </span>and <span class= "ital">crooked </span>generation" supplies two words to <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm" title="With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself devious.">Psalm 18:26</a>, "with the <span class= "ital">froward </span>thou wilt <span class= "ital">shew thyself froward" </span>Compare also the context of the two passages. Many other interpretations have been proposed, and some have altered the text.
