This phrase introduces a scenario where a servant voluntarily chooses to remain with their master. The context is the sabbatical year, a time when Hebrew servants were to be released (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>). This provision highlights the servant's agency and the possibility of a positive relationship between servant and master.<p><b>&#8216;I do not want to leave you,&#8217;</b><br>This declaration indicates a deep bond between the servant and the master. It suggests a relationship built on trust and mutual respect, rather than mere obligation. The servant's choice to stay reflects a voluntary commitment, which is significant in a culture where freedom was highly valued. This mirrors the New Testament concept of being a "bondservant" of Christ, where believers willingly submit to Jesus out of love (<a href="/philippians/1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>).<p><b>because he loves you and your household</b><br>The servant's love for the master and his household implies a familial relationship, transcending the typical master-servant dynamic. This love is reminiscent of the love believers are called to have for God and His family, the Church (1 <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19-21</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle that love should be the foundation of all relationships (<a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-3</a>).<p><b>and is well off with you,</b><br>The phrase "is well off" suggests that the servant's material and emotional needs are met. This indicates that the master has fulfilled the biblical mandate to treat servants with kindness and fairness (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-43</a>). It also points to the blessings of living under God's covenant, where obedience leads to prosperity and well-being (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). This can be seen as a type of the abundant life promised by Jesus to His followers (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant (Hebrew: ?????, 'eved')</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, a servant could be a fellow Hebrew who, due to poverty, sold themselves into servitude.

This was not a painful operation, especially as the servant's ear was probably already pierced for a ring; nor does any infamy appear to have been attached to the bearing of this badge of perpetual servitude. There is no mention here, as in Exodus, of the matter being referred to the judges; and this has led some to suppose that, by the time this later prescription was given, the earlier usage had passed away; but it is more natural to suppose that this usage was so regular and well known that it was needless formally to announce it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/15-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your servant says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
