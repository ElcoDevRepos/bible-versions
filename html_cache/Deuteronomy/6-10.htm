The Israelites' entry into the Promised Land is not by their own strength but by God's providence. This reflects the theme of divine sovereignty and grace, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The land is a gift from God, symbolizing His faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant.<p><b>He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</b><br>This highlights the covenantal promise God made to the patriarchs. The land promise is a central theme in Genesis, beginning with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21), reiterated to Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>), and confirmed to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). This continuity underscores God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His word. It also serves as a reminder of the Israelites' identity and heritage, rooted in God's promises.<p><b>that He would give you&#8212;</b><br>The land is described as a gift, emphasizing grace rather than merit. This reflects the biblical principle that God's blessings are not earned but given out of His love and faithfulness. The concept of the land as a divine gift is foundational to Israel's understanding of their relationship with God and their role as His chosen people.<p><b>a land with great and splendid cities</b><br>The description of the land as having "great and splendid cities" indicates its richness and the abundance awaiting the Israelites. This aligns with the biblical portrayal of the Promised Land as a place of prosperity and blessing (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The cities, already established and developed, signify the completeness of God's provision.<p><b>that you did not build,</b><br>This phrase underscores the unearned nature of the blessing. The Israelites are to inherit cities they did not labor to construct, highlighting God's grace and the fulfillment of His promises. It serves as a reminder of God's provision and the importance of gratitude and reliance on Him. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers receive salvation and blessings through Christ's work, not their own (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are about to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, a land of abundance and prosperity, promised by God to the patriarchs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs to whom God made the original covenant promises regarding the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cities.htm">The Cities</a></b><br>Great and splendid cities in the Promised Land that the Israelites did not build, symbolizing God's provision and grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God is faithful to fulfill His promises, as seen in His covenant with the patriarchs.

The people&#8217;s obedience matters, yet the outcome rests on God&#8217;s unfailing resolve.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the wording underscores that God still initiates and completes His purposes (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). When He calls, He also carries through.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the land He swore to your fathers</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;land&#8221; is not a vague hope; it is the specific territory God pledged in <a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-17</a> and confirmed in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He swore&#8221; recalls the solemn, unconditional nature of the covenant (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>). God&#8217;s oath places His own character on the line.<p>&#8226; The verse therefore reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that divine promises remain anchored in God&#8217;s integrity, not in fluctuating human faithfulness (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</b><p>&#8226; Mentioning the patriarchs ties the promise to real historical figures (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>; <a href="/acts/7-32.htm">Acts 7:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The three names also highlight a multigenerational faithfulness: what God started with Abraham, He continued with Isaac and Jacob, and now He is completing with their descendants (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; This pattern encourages modern readers to trust God&#8217;s long-range plan for families, churches, and nations (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He would give you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Give&#8221; magnifies grace.
