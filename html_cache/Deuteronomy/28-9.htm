The concept of being "holy" is rooted in the Hebrew word "qadosh," meaning set apart for a special purpose. This echoes God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) and the call to holiness found in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. The establishment of Israel as a holy people is both a privilege and a responsibility, reflecting God's desire for a people who embody His character and purposes on earth.<p><b>just as He has sworn to you</b><br>This refers to the covenantal promises God made to the patriarchs, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These promises are foundational to Israel's identity and destiny (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-5</a>, <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). The swearing of an oath by God underscores the certainty and unchangeable nature of His promises (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>). It highlights God's faithfulness and the assurance that He will fulfill His word.<p><b>if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God</b><br>The conditional nature of this promise is significant. It underscores the importance of obedience to God's law as a prerequisite for receiving His blessings. The commandments given at Sinai (Exodus 20) and throughout the Torah are central to Israel's covenant relationship with God. Obedience is not merely a legalistic requirement but a demonstration of love and loyalty to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-6</a>, <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>and walk in His ways</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies a lifestyle that reflects His character and values. It involves more than external compliance; it requires a heart aligned with God's will (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). This phrase suggests a continuous, active pursuit of righteousness and justice, mirroring the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodied God's ways (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-22</a>).

Israel&#8217;s stability never started with their own strength; it began with the unchanging character of the LORD who &#8220;remains faithful forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>). Just as He upheld Noah in the flood (<a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>) and David on the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>), He pledges to set His people on solid ground. The verse reminds us that anyone who rests on God&#8217;s promise&#8212;not personal performance&#8212;stands on bedrock.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as His holy people</b><p>&#8220;Holy&#8221; means set apart for God&#8217;s exclusive use. At Sinai He said, &#8220;you will be My special possession&#8230; a holy nation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>). <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> repeats the same identity: belonging to Him, reflecting His purity, displaying His glory (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Holiness is not a badge we create; it is a status He grants. The call, then, is to live out what He has already declared, shining like &#8220;a city on a hill&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as He has sworn to you</b><p>This promise is oath-backed. God swore to Abraham, &#8220;By Myself I have sworn&#8230; in your seed all nations will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16&#8211;18</a>). He confirmed it to Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>) and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>). <a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8-9</a> underscores that the LORD keeps covenant &#8220;to a thousand generations.&#8221; Because His word is unbreakable (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>), their confidence could be unshakable. His oath is the guarantee behind every blessing listed in this chapter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God</b><p>The covenant&#8217;s blessings were conditional on obedience. Moses had already set life and death before them (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-28</a>). Keeping commands was not legalistic ladder-climbing; it was the loving response to a saving God (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Obedience proved the relationship was real (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>). In practical terms it meant honoring Sabbaths, guarding justice, caring for the vulnerable&#8212;daily choices that showed God&#8217;s law was written on their hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and walk in His ways</b><p>To &#8220;walk&#8221; pictures an ongoing lifestyle. Obedience is not a one-off act but a steady path&#8212;step after step in line with His character (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). <a href="/bsb/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a> contrasts two paths: the blessed man delights in God&#8217;s law &#8220;day and night,&#8221; bearing fruit in every season. Likewise, Paul urges believers to &#8220;walk by the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>). The emphasis is movement, direction, perseverance. Walking in His ways means aligning every decision, habit, and ambition with His revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/28-9.htm">Deuteronomy 28:9</a> promises that the LORD Himself will firmly plant His people as a distinct, holy nation, backed by His unbreakable oath. The blessing, however, is experienced only as they obey His commands and continually walk in His ways. God supplies the foundation, identity, and guarantee; His people respond with loving, lifelong obedience. The verse calls every generation to trust His promise, treasure His holiness, and demonstrate that trust by the daily steps of faithful living.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The Lord shall establish thee an holy people</span>--i.e., shall "maintain" thee in that position or shall "raise thee up" into it, and exalt thee to it, in its fullest sense.
