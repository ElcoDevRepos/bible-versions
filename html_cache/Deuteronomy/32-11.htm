In the biblical context, the eagle is often a symbol of strength and protection. The imagery suggests God's active role in preparing and guiding His people, Israel, much like an eagle ensures its offspring are ready to leave the nest. This preparation can be seen in God's guidance of Israel through the wilderness, teaching them reliance and trust in Him.<p><b>and hovers over its young</b><br>The hovering of the eagle over its young signifies a protective and nurturing presence. This reflects God's constant watchfulness and care over Israel. The Hebrew word used here can also imply a gentle movement, indicating God's tender care. This is reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, suggesting a creative and life-giving presence.<p><b>He spread His wings to catch them</b><br>This phrase illustrates God's readiness to support and rescue His people. Just as an eagle spreads its wings to catch its young if they fall, God is depicted as a savior who intervenes in times of trouble. This can be connected to the many instances in the Old Testament where God delivers Israel from danger, such as the Exodus from Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and support to believers.<p><b>and carried them on His pinions</b><br>The carrying on pinions emphasizes God's strength and the security He provides. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the eagle was a powerful symbol of protection and deliverance. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>, where God tells Israel, "I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself." It signifies the divine care and guidance that leads to safety and fulfillment of God's promises. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who carries the burdens of humanity and offers rest and salvation to those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering his final messages to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom Moses is addressing in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eagle.htm">Eagle</a></b><br>A metaphor used to describe God's care and protection over Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites have been wandering for 40 years, experiencing God's provision and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination that the Israelites are about to enter, representing God's fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protective_nature.htm">God's Protective Nature</a></b><br>Just as an eagle cares for its young, God is deeply involved in the protection and nurturing of His people.

He is one of the creatures that is honoured with a description by the lips of Jehovah Himself in <a href="/context/job/39-27.htm" title="Does the eagle mount up at your command, and make her nest on high?">Job 39:27-30</a>. But beautiful as the simile and the description in these places are, they are surpassed in gentleness by our Saviour when He says, "How often would I have gathered thy children together, <span class= "ital">as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, </span>and ye would not" (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!">Luke 13:34</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - God's treatment of his people is compared to that of an eagle towards its young (cf. <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>). In the Authorized Version, the apodosis of the sentence is made to begin at ver. 12, and ver. 11 is wholly understood of the eagle and its young. To this arrangement it has been objected that it overlooks the fact that the suffixes to the verbs "taketh" and "beareth" are singulars, and are to be understood consequently, not of the eaglets, but of Israel. It has, therefore, been proposed to render the passage thus: <span class="accented">As an eagle which stirreth up its nest</span>, <span class="accented">fluttereth over its young</span>, <span class="accented">he spread out his wings</span>, <span class="accented">took him up</span>, <span class="accented">and carried him on his pinions</span>. <span class="accented">The Lord alone did lead him</span>, etc. The comparison is thus made to pass into a metaphorical representation of the Lord's dealing with Israel. One feels that there is something violent in this, for whilst God's care for Israel might be fittingly <span class="accented">compared to</span> that of an eagle towards her young, it is less fit to speak of God himself as if he <span class="accented">were</span> an eagle with wings which he spread abroad and on which he bare Israel. The rendering in the Authorized Version is on this account to be preferred, if it can be grammatically vindicated. And this it may on the ground that the suffixes may be understood of the "nest" as containing the young ("continens pro contento," a common rhetorical trope in Scripture; see Glass., 'Philippians Sac.,' p. 686; cf. Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:475, "nidisque loquacibus escam"); or the young may be referred to individually, "taketh it, beareth it," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. each of them; or, if the nest be understood, the whole body of them as therein contained. <span class="cmt_word">Stirreth up her</span> [its] <span class="cmt_word">nest</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. its nestlings; <span class="accented">provocans ad</span> <span class="accented">volandum pullos suos</span>, <span class="accented">Vulgate</span>. This is the explanation usually given of the initial clause of this verse; but its accuracy has been questioned, Furst would render the verb by "watchesover; "but though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, as the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to watch, may have this meaning, it is undoubtedly used generally in the sense of rousing, exciting, stirring up. Knobel retains this meaning, but understands the clause of the exciting of the nestlings by the parent bird coming to them with food. This is certainly more in keeping with what follows; for when the eagle nestles or broods over her young, she does not excite them to fly. <span class="cmt_word">Fluttereth over her young</span>; rather, <span class="accented">broods over</span>, <span class="accented">nestles</span>, or <span class="accented">cherishes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Spreadeth abroad her wings,</span> etc. "I once saw a very interesting sight above one of the crags of Ben Nevis, as I was going in pursuit of black game. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of a mountain, in the eye of the sun; - it was about midday, and bright for this climate. They at first made small circles, and the young imitated them; they paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their first flight, holding them on their expanded wings when they appeared exhausted, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising towards the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight, so as to make a gradually ascending spiral" (Davy, 'Salinertia;' see also Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 2:181). The general reference is to God's fostering care of Israel, and especially his dealing with them when "he suffered their manners in the wilderness" (<a href="/acts/13-18.htm">Acts 13:18</a>), disciplined them, and trained them for what they were appointed to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As an eagle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1433;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;ne&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
