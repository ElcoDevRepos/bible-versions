In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is recounting the events to the new generation of Israelites before they enter the Promised Land. This direct speech from God underscores the authority of Moses' leadership and the divine origin of his message. It also sets the stage for the promise of a future prophet like Moses, which is a key theme in <a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>.<p><b>They have spoken well</b><br>This refers to the Israelites' request for a mediator between them and God, as they were fearful of hearing God's voice directly at Mount Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23-27</a>). Their request is acknowledged by God as appropriate, recognizing the people's need for an intermediary. This sets a precedent for the prophetic office in Israel, where prophets would serve as God's spokespeople. Theologically, this anticipates the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate Prophet, Priest, and King, fulfilling the role of mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). The acknowledgment that "they have spoken well" also reflects God's understanding and accommodation of human limitations and fears.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks to Moses and guides the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of Israel, who acts as a mediator between God and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving instructions and guidance through Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites are preparing to enter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who are called by God to speak His words to the people, a role that Moses fulfills and which will continue with future prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_affirmation_of_righteous_requests.htm">God's Affirmation of Righteous Requests</a></b><br>The Israelites' request for a mediator was acknowledged by God as good.
