At the same time, God announced to Moses that after his death the people would go astray, and turn to idolatry, and violate the covenant, so that God's anger should be kindled against them, and he would leave them to suffer the consequences of their folly and sin. In view of this, Moses was directed to write a song and teach it to the people, that it might abide with them as a witness against them, rising up, as songs will do, in the memory of the nation, even after they had apostatized from the path in which the author of the song had led them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of the congregation</span>; properly, <span class="accented">the tent of meeting</span> (cf. <a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32</a>).
