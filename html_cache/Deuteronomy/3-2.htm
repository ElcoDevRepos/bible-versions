In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses often recounts God's commands to the Israelites, reinforcing his role as a prophet and leader. This communication underscores the personal relationship between God and Moses, a theme prevalent throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>Do not fear him</b><br>God's command to not fear Og, king of Bashan, reassures the Israelites of divine protection and victory. Fear is a common human response to formidable enemies, but God consistently instructs His people to trust in His power rather than their own strength. This echoes similar commands given to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>) and reflects the broader biblical theme of faith over fear.<p><b>for I have delivered him into your hand</b><br>This phrase signifies God's sovereignty and control over the outcome of battles. The use of the past tense "have delivered" indicates the certainty of victory, even before the battle begins. This assurance is a recurring motif in the conquest narratives, where God promises victory to His people as long as they remain faithful.<p><b>along with all his people and his land</b><br>The inclusion of Og's people and land highlights the comprehensive nature of God's promise. It is not just the king who will be defeated, but his entire domain. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of total conquest and the transfer of land, which was a sign of divine favor and fulfillment of the promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites</b><br>This reference to Sihon serves as a reminder of past victories granted by God, reinforcing the Israelites' confidence. The defeat of Sihon is recounted in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a>, where God delivered the Amorite king into Israel's hands. This historical precedent serves as a tangible example of God's faithfulness and power.<p><b>who lived in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon, king of the Amorites. Its mention here situates the narrative in a specific geographical and historical context. Archaeological evidence suggests Heshbon was a significant city during this period, and its conquest would have been a notable achievement for the Israelites. This detail underscores the reality of the biblical narrative and God's intervention in history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who guides and commands His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who receives God's instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>A formidable enemy king whom God assures Moses will be defeated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_the_amorites.htm">Sihon, King of the Amorites</a></b><br>Previously defeated by the Israelites, serving as a precedent for God's promise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>The region ruled by Og, known for its strongholds and giants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Just as God assured Moses of victory over Og, believers can trust in God's promises for their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_not.htm">Fear Not</a></b><br>The command to not fear is a recurring theme in Scripture, reminding us that God is in control.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/past_victories_as_faith_builders.htm">Past Victories as Faith Builders</a></b><br>Reflecting on past victories, like the defeat of Sihon, can strengthen our faith for current challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is sovereign over all nations and rulers, and His plans will prevail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Moses' obedience to God's instructions is a model for us to follow God's guidance without hesitation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_3_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Deut_3_2_show_God_s_assurance.htm">How does Deuteronomy 3:2 demonstrate God's assurance in overcoming challenges today?
