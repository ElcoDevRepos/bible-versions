In the biblical context, God's election of Israel is rooted in His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This choice is an act of grace, not based on Israel's actions or qualities. The concept of divine election is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are chosen by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>). This reflects God's unchanging nature and His purpose to establish a people for Himself.<p><b>because you were more numerous than the other peoples</b><br>This highlights that God's choice was not based on Israel's size or strength. Historically, Israel was a small nation compared to the great empires of Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon. This underscores the miraculous nature of their survival and success, attributed to divine intervention rather than human power. Theologically, it points to the principle that God often chooses the weak and insignificant to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>, where God uses the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.<p><b>for you were the fewest of all peoples</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea of Israel's humble beginnings. Archaeological evidence suggests that the early Israelites were a small, tribal society. Culturally, they were distinct from the surrounding nations, with unique religious practices centered on monotheism. This smallness serves to magnify God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. It also prefigures the coming of Jesus Christ, who, though born in humble circumstances, became the Savior of the world, fulfilling the prophecy of a ruler from Bethlehem, "though you are small among the clans of Judah" (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who chose the Israelites as His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, chosen by God to be His special people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's laws and commandments to them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, which they were to enter and possess.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God's choice of Israel was not based on their size or strength but on His sovereign will and love.

The same principle encourages believers today: our security rests not in our resources but in the steadfast, electing love of the LORD who delights to display His power through those who know they are powerless without Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The Lord did not . . . choose you, because ye were more.</span>--The danger lest Israel's peculiar relation to the Most High should beget national pride is so obvious, that Moses takes special pains to counteract it by asserting God's sovereignty in the choice.<p><span class= "bld">Ye were the fewest of all people.</span>--It may be observed that the development of the Moabites, Ammonites, Ishmaelites, and Edomites (all, like Israel, descended from Terah), was far more rapid than that of the chosen line. Abraham had twelve grandsons through Ishmael, but only the same number of <span class= "ital">great </span>grandsons through Isaac and Jacob. Edom, Moab, and Ammon all preceded Israel in the conquest of territory. Kings reigned in Edom "before there reigned any king over the children of Israel" (<a href="/genesis/36-31.htm" title="And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.">Genesis 36:31</a>). It was only "when the time of the promise drew nigh" that "the (chosen) people grew and multiplied in Egypt." The Scripture is throughout consistent in representing their development as due to the special providence of God.
