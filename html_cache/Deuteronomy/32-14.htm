Curds and milk were staples in the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizing prosperity and sustenance. The herd and flock refer to cattle and sheep, which were central to the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites. This provision reflects God's care and blessing, reminiscent of the land "flowing with milk and honey" promised in <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>.<p><b>with the fat of lambs</b><br>The "fat of lambs" signifies the best and most luxurious part of the meat, often reserved for special occasions and offerings (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). In biblical times, fat was considered a delicacy and a sign of wealth. This phrase underscores the lavishness of God's provision, pointing to the abundance of the Promised Land.<p><b>with rams from Bashan, and goats</b><br>Bashan was a region known for its fertile land and robust livestock (<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>). Rams and goats from Bashan were prized for their quality, indicating the superior resources available to the Israelites. This reflects God's promise of a bountiful land, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, where the land is described as one of plenty.<p><b>with the choicest grains of wheat</b><br>Wheat was a staple grain in ancient Israel, and the "choicest grains" imply the finest quality, essential for making bread, a daily necessity. This abundance of high-quality wheat symbolizes God's provision and blessing, aligning with the promise of prosperity in the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>).<p><b>From the juice of the finest grapes you drank the wine</b><br>Wine, made from the "finest grapes," was a symbol of joy and celebration in biblical culture (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). It was often used in religious ceremonies and as a sign of God's blessing. This phrase not only highlights the fertility of the land but also foreshadows the New Testament imagery of Jesus as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), where wine represents His blood in the New Covenant (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering a song to the Israelites as a reminder of God's provision and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of Moses' message, God's chosen people who are being reminded of His blessings and their covenant relationship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A fertile region known for its rich pastures and strong livestock, symbolizing abundance and God's provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land flowing with milk and honey, representing God's promise and the fulfillment of His covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A poetic recounting of God's faithfulness and Israel's history, serving as both a reminder and a warning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides abundantly for His people, both physically and spiritually.

In a literal, agrarian culture this signals daily nourishment, strength, and comfort supplied directly by God. Just as the LORD promised a land &#8220;flowing with milk and honey&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), He actually delivered that promise during Israel&#8217;s wilderness journey and in Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-9.htm">Deuteronomy 26:9&#8211;11</a>). <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1&#8211;2</a> reminds us that when the LORD is Shepherd, He leads to green pastures and still waters; the curds and milk in this verse place Israel right in those pastures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The fat of lambs</b><p>&#8220;Fat&#8221; represents the richest portion, reserved for God in sacrificial law (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>), yet here He gives that very richness to His people. <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a> urges, &#8220;eat what is good and let your soul delight in abundance,&#8221; the same theme Moses sings about. Literally, healthy flocks produced well-fed lambs; spiritually, the LORD fed Israel with His best.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rams from Bashan</b><p>Bashan, northeast of the Jordan, was famous for lush pastures (<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>). &#8220;Rams from Bashan&#8221; therefore indicates prize livestock&#8212;robust, unblemished, ideal for food and sacrifice. God did not skimp; He provided premier quality, paralleling <a href="/ezekiel/39-18.htm">Ezekiel 39:18</a> where warriors are likened to &#8220;rams, lambs, goats, and bulls&#8212;all of them fatlings of Bashan.&#8221; The prosperity described in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a> came to pass exactly as stated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And goats</b><p>Goats supplied meat, milk, skins, and even sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15</a>). By including goats, the text covers every major category of herd animal, stressing fullness. <a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a> shows Gideon serving an entire goat to one divine visitor&#8212;an act of lavish hospitality. Likewise, God hospitably lavished provision on Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The choicest grains of wheat</b><p>Grain was the staple of life. The expression translated &#8220;choicest&#8221; depicts kernels sifted free of chaff, the very best for bread (<a href="/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>). Literally, the LORD ensured fertile soil and abundant harvests (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13&#8211;15</a>). Spiritually, Jesus would later identify Himself as the &#8220;grain&#8221; that must die to bring life (<a href="/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>), the ultimate fulfillment of God&#8217;s provision theme.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Juice of the finest grapes&#8212;wine</b><p>The verse closes, &#8220;From the juice of the finest grapes you drank the wine.&#8221; Wine in Scripture marks joy and covenant blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-10.htm">Proverbs 3:10</a>). The imagery becomes literal reality in <a href="/joshua/24-13.htm">Joshua 24:13</a>, where Israel enjoys vineyards they did not plant. It also foreshadows the New Covenant cup (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-29</a>), God again giving His people the very best.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a> catalogs God&#8217;s tangible, literal gifts&#8212;rich dairy, prime meat, superior grain, and celebratory wine&#8212;demonstrating His faithful, covenant love.

There is no ground for the explanation "fery wine" (Keil); wine in such a state was never among the Hebrews counted a blessing. That they had and used fermented wine is certain; but what they specially esteemed as a luxury was the pure unadulterated juice of the grape freshly pressed out and drunk with the foam on it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">with curds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;em&#183;&#8217;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2529.htm">Strong's 2529: </a> </span><span class="str2">Curdled milk, cheese</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the herd</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;q&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1241.htm">Strong's 1241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Beef cattle, ox, a herd</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and milk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
