Benjamin was the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, and his tribe held a unique position among the tribes of Israel. Historically, the tribe of Benjamin was known for its warriors and played a significant role in Israel's history, including the establishment of the first king, Saul, who was from this tribe. The blessing reflects the special favor and protection Benjamin receives from God.<p><b>May the beloved of the LORD rest secure in Him;</b><br>The term "beloved of the LORD" signifies a deep, personal affection from God towards Benjamin. This phrase emphasizes the intimate relationship between God and the tribe, suggesting a special status among the tribes of Israel. The idea of resting secure in God implies a state of peace and safety, highlighting God's protective nature. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God as a refuge and fortress, as seen in Psalms 91:1-2.<p><b>God shields him all day long,</b><br>This part of the blessing underscores God's continuous protection over Benjamin. The imagery of a shield is common in biblical literature, symbolizing defense and safety. It suggests that God's protection is not temporary but constant, providing assurance against any threats. This aligns with the promises found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5-8</a>, where God is described as the keeper and protector of His people.<p><b>and upon His shoulders he rests.</b><br>The imagery of resting upon God's shoulders conveys a sense of care and support. It suggests that Benjamin is carried by God, much like a shepherd carries a lamb, indicating both protection and guidance. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is often depicted as the Good Shepherd in the New Testament (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), carrying and caring for His flock. The phrase also evokes the image of a father carrying a child, emphasizing the closeness and trust in the relationship between God and Benjamin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, and the ancestor of the tribe of Benjamin.

In verse 12 he turns to Benjamin, Jacob&#8217;s youngest son and the tribe that would later host Jerusalem&#8217;s temple precincts (<a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11, 28</a>).<p>- The tribal inheritance lay &#8220;between the shoulders&#8221; of Ephraim and Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; 18:16), a place of strategic safety. God&#8217;s sovereignty in choosing that location anticipates the security promised in the rest of the blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;May the beloved of the LORD&#8221;</b><p>- Benjamin is called &#8220;the beloved,&#8221; echoing <a href="/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a> where Rachel named her dying son Ben-oni but Jacob renamed him Benjamin, &#8220;son of my right hand,&#8221; a term of affection and favor.<p>- Scripture uses &#8220;beloved&#8221; for those God sets apart in covenant love: Solomon (<a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24&#8211;25</a>), the Church (<a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>), and ultimately Christ (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>).<p>- The title underscores grace: God loves first, then blesses (<a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;rest secure in Him; God shields him all day long&#8221;</b><p>- Security is not merely physical but relational&#8212;&#8220;in Him.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1&#8211;2</a> speaks the same language: &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221;<p>- &#8220;All day long&#8221; highlights constant protection, mirrored in <a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>, &#8220;I, the LORD, guard it; every moment I water it.&#8221;<p>- For Benjamin this was literally seen when the temple, God&#8217;s dwelling, stood within its territory; for believers today, Christ Himself is our sanctuary (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and upon His shoulders he rests.&#8221;</b><p>- Picture a shepherd carrying a lamb (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="/luke/15-5.htm">Luke 15:5</a>). The tribe rested on God&#8217;s shoulders, just as the high priest bore Israel&#8217;s names on onyx stones &#8220;on his shoulders&#8221; before the LORD (<a href="/exodus/28-12.htm">Exodus 28:12</a>).<p>- Shoulders signify strength and nearness.

Literally fulfilled in the tribe&#8217;s protected land and the placement of the temple, the blessing also previews the permanent refuge every believer enjoys in Christ&#8212;loved by the Father, guarded without pause, and carried close to His heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And of Benjamin.</span>--It is generally agreed that this blessing points to the site of the place which Jehovah chose out of all the tribes of Israel, <span class= "ital">Jerusalem, in the tribe of Benjamin. </span>The Hebrew is divided thus:--<p>"Unto Benjamin he said.

There can be no doubt that Benjamin is the subject of this clause; to understand it of Jehovah dwelling on the shoulders of Benjamin, in the sense of having the temple, the place of his rest, within the territory of Benjamin, is too violent and far-fetched an interpretation to be admitted. In the change of subject in the three clauses of this verse, there is nothing strange, since such a change repeatedly occurs, and is found even in prose, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/2_samuel/11-13.htm">2 Samuel 11:13</a>. "To dwell upon God, and between his shoulders, means as much as to lean upon him; the similitude being taken from fathers who carry their sons while yet small and tender" (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Concerning Benjamin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;in&#183;y&#257;&#183;min)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
