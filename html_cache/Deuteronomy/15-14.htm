The instruction to furnish "liberally" underscores the importance of not being stingy or begrudging in giving. The mention of "your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress" highlights the primary sources of wealth and sustenance in ancient Israel, which were livestock, grain, and wine. This reflects an agrarian society where these resources were vital for survival and prosperity. The command to provide from these areas indicates a holistic approach to generosity, ensuring that the released servant is well-equipped to start anew. This principle of liberality is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to give generously and cheerfully (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>You shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.</b><br>This phrase connects the act of giving to the recognition of God's blessings. It implies that the ability to give is a direct result of the blessings received from God, fostering a sense of stewardship rather than ownership. The phrase "as the LORD your God has blessed you" serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience and faithfulness. This concept is rooted in the broader Deuteronomic theology, which links obedience to God's commandments with material and spiritual prosperity (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The call to give in proportion to one's blessings is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the principle of tithing and in the New Testament teachings on giving according to one's means (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>).

Those who had fallen into poverty, when they had served their time, must be provided with means for a fresh start in life. And since the Jewish commentator regards the slavery of Hebrew men as chiefly a consequence of theft (If he be sold unto thee, "when the supreme court has sold him for his theft "), it would seem that, under Jewish law, even convicted thieves, when the term of their servitude was over, were to be provided with the means of obtaining an honest livelihood.
