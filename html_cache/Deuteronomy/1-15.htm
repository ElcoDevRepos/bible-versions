The tribes of Israel were the descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob, each forming a distinct group within the nation. The selection of leaders from each tribe ensured representation and maintained tribal identity. This action reflects the organizational structure necessary for governing a large group, as seen in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>, where Jethro advises Moses to appoint capable men to help judge the people.<p><b>wise and respected men</b><br>The criteria for leadership included wisdom and respect, indicating the importance of character and reputation in leadership roles. Wisdom in the biblical sense often refers to the ability to apply knowledge and understanding in a godly manner. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> highlights the fear of the Lord as the beginning of knowledge, suggesting that true wisdom is rooted in reverence for God. Respect implies that these men were held in high esteem by their peers, which is crucial for effective leadership.<p><b>and appointed them as leaders over you</b><br>Moses' appointment of these leaders signifies a divinely sanctioned delegation of authority. This delegation is a practical application of shared leadership, which is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the New Testament with the appointment of deacons in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>. It underscores the principle that leadership is a responsibility given by God, and those appointed are accountable to both God and the people they serve.<p><b>as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens</b><br>This hierarchical structure reflects a military organization, which was necessary for maintaining order and discipline among the Israelites. The division into thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens allowed for efficient management and communication. This system is reminiscent of the Roman centurion structure and is indicative of the need for scalable leadership models. It also parallels the New Testament church's structure, where different roles and gifts are recognized for the edification of the body (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>).<p><b>and as officers for your tribes</b><br>The term "officers" suggests roles of administration and enforcement of laws. These officers were responsible for the day-to-day governance and ensuring that justice was upheld within the tribes. This role is similar to that of elders in the early church, who were tasked with shepherding and overseeing the congregation (<a href="/1_peter/5.htm">1 Peter 5:1-3</a>). The establishment of officers highlights the importance of order and justice in a community, reflecting God's character as a God of order and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is recounting the events of appointing leaders over the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_tribes.htm">Israelite Tribes</a></b><br>The twelve tribes of Israel, each requiring leadership and governance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders/commanders.htm">Leaders/Commanders</a></b><br>Wise and respected men chosen to lead and manage the people at various levels of organization.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_journey.htm">Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The context in which these events occur, as the Israelites are preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_horeb.htm">Mount Horeb</a></b><br>The location where Moses received the command to appoint leaders, as part of the broader account of Israel's journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/delegation_of_authority.htm">Delegation of Authority</a></b><br>Godly leadership involves recognizing the need for shared responsibility.

This serves as a model for selecting leaders in various contexts today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/organizational_structure.htm">Organizational Structure</a></b><br>The division of leadership into commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens illustrates the need for an organized structure in managing large groups. This principle can be applied in church, business, and community settings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_involvement.htm">Community Involvement</a></b><br>The involvement of the community in recognizing and affirming leaders emphasizes the role of the community in governance and decision-making processes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sustainability_in_leadership.htm">Sustainability in Leadership</a></b><br>By sharing the burden of leadership, Moses ensured the sustainability of governance and prevented burnout.

By doing so, he put into practice the counsel first modeled in <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>, where &#8220;Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people.&#8221; The action underscores that leadership in God&#8217;s community is not a popularity contest but an acknowledgment of those whom God has already raised up (cf. <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wise and respected men</b><p>Character, not charisma, qualified these leaders. Wisdom&#8212;living insight that begins with &#8220;the fear of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>)&#8212;and respectability were non-negotiable. <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a> adds &#8220;men who fear God, men of truth, hating dishonest gain.&#8221; Their integrity guarded Israel from corruption and mirrored the New-Testament standard for church elders in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2-7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and appointed them as leaders over you</b><p>Appointment conferred authority but also accountability. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> reminds us that &#8220;there is no authority except from God,&#8221; while <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> calls believers to &#8220;obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls.&#8221; Moses&#8217; act established a leadership structure that protected both the people and the leaders themselves from overload.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as commanders of thousands</b><p>The highest tier handled large-scale issues&#8212;war strategies, national crises, covenant enforcement (<a href="/numbers/31-14.htm">Numbers 31:14</a>). Their broader perspective parallels modern regional overseers or denominational leaders who coordinate ministries impacting thousands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of hundreds</b><p>This middle layer bridged the gap between national decisions and local needs. Like today&#8217;s district pastors or ministry directors, they translated overarching vision into actionable steps for smaller communities (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of fifties</b><p>Leaders at this level provided closer supervision&#8212;similar to small-group coaches or department heads. When Elijah confronted King Ahaziah&#8217;s captains of fifty (<a href="/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9-14</a>), it showed how even mid-level officers carried real authority and responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of tens</b><p>Grass-roots oversight happened here. Commanders of ten knew each family personally, enabling swift justice and pastoral care. Jesus affirmed the value of faithfulness in &#8220;very small matters&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>), a principle embodied by these leaders who shepherded the smallest units.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and as officers for your tribes</b><p>Beyond military ranks, &#8220;officers&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/31-48.htm">Numbers 31:48</a>) functioned as administrative judges, scribes, and record keepers. They ensured laws were communicated and cases recorded, echoing the New-Testament role of deacons who handle practical affairs so spiritual leaders remain devoted to prayer and the Word (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a> shows Moses implementing a God-given, tiered leadership system rooted in wisdom, character, and shared responsibility. By distributing authority&#8212;from commanders of thousands down to tens&#8212;Israel gained order, justice, and care at every level. The pattern still guides the church: identify godly, respected men and women, match responsibility to capacity, and recognize that all true authority flows from the Lord who loves His people enough to lead them well.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1438;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
