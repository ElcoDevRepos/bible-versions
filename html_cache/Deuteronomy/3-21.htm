Moses, knowing he will not enter the Promised Land, prepares Joshua to lead Israel. This command signifies the passing of responsibility and authority. Joshua's role as Moses' assistant (<a href="/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>) and his experience as a military leader (<a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-14</a>) make him a fitting successor. This transition is crucial for maintaining continuity in leadership as Israel prepares to enter Canaan.<p><b>Your own eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings:</b><br>The reference to "these two kings" points to Sihon and Og, whose defeat is recounted in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-3</a>:11. These victories demonstrate God's power and faithfulness, serving as tangible evidence for Joshua and the Israelites. The phrase emphasizes the importance of eyewitness testimony in establishing faith and confidence in God's promises. It also serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness as a basis for future trust.<p><b>The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter:</b><br>This assurance of future victories is rooted in the covenant promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The phrase underscores God's unchanging nature and His commitment to fulfill His promises. It also foreshadows the conquests in the Book of Joshua, where God continues to deliver the land into Israel's hands.
