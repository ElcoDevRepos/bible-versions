This was a way to provide for the widow and ensure the continuation of the family line. The first son born from this union was considered the legal heir of the deceased brother. This practice is also seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz, where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>will carry on the name of the dead brother</b><br>The importance of carrying on the family name was deeply rooted in the culture of Israel. A name represented one's identity, legacy, and inheritance. By ensuring the deceased brother's name continued, the family line and property rights were preserved. This reflects the communal and familial responsibilities emphasized in the Mosaic Law, where the welfare of the family and tribe was paramount.<p><b>so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel</b><br>The concept of a name being "blotted out" signifies the erasure of one's legacy and memory from the community. In Israelite society, being remembered was tied to one's honor and standing before God and the people. This phrase underscores the importance of legacy and continuity within the covenant community of Israel. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of remembrance and the eternal nature of God's promises, as seen in the genealogies and the emphasis on lineage throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levirate_marriage.htm">Levirate Marriage</a></b><br>A cultural practice where a man marries his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in the brother's name.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are preparing to enter and settle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance_and_legacy.htm">Inheritance and Legacy</a></b><br>The broader context of maintaining family lineage and property within the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preservation_of_family_legacy.htm">Preservation of Family Legacy</a></b><br>The command in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6</a> underscores the importance of family and legacy in God's plan.
