The tribe of Asher was known for its rich land and abundance, located in the fertile region of northern Canaan. This blessing is part of Moses' final words to the tribes of Israel, similar to Jacob's blessings in <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>. Moses' blessings often reflect the character or future of the tribes.<p><b>May Asher be the most blessed of sons;</b><br>The blessing of Asher emphasizes prosperity and abundance. Historically, the tribe of Asher was situated in a region known for its olive oil production, which was a valuable commodity in ancient times. This blessing can be seen as a prophetic declaration of the tribe's future prosperity and favor. The phrase "most blessed of sons" suggests a special favor and abundance that would distinguish Asher among the tribes.<p><b>May he be the most favored among his brothers</b><br>This part of the blessing highlights the idea of favor and acceptance. In the context of the tribes of Israel, being favored among brothers implies a position of honor and respect. This could also suggest a harmonious relationship with other tribes, where Asher would be seen as a leader or a source of blessing. The favor mentioned here can be seen as both material and relational, indicating peace and prosperity.<p><b>And dip his foot in oil.</b><br>This phrase is often interpreted as a metaphor for prosperity and abundance. The region of Asher was known for its olive groves, and oil was a symbol of wealth and blessing in biblical times. The imagery of dipping one's foot in oil suggests an overflow of resources and blessings. This can also be seen as a type of anointing, which in biblical terms signifies being set apart for a special purpose or receiving divine favor. The abundance of oil could also be a foreshadowing of spiritual blessings, pointing to the anointing of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>Asher is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after the eighth son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant.
