This location is significant as it marks the starting point of Israel's conquest in this region. The Arnon Valley itself is a deep gorge, and its mention highlights the geographical challenges faced by the Israelites. The strategic position of Aroer underscores the importance of controlling key locations for military and trade purposes.<p><b>along with the city in the valley</b><br>The city in the valley likely refers to a settlement within the Arnon Valley, possibly Ar or another Moabite city. This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness of the conquest, indicating that not only the elevated cities but also those in more challenging terrains were captured. The mention of cities in valleys suggests the comprehensive nature of God's promise to deliver the land to Israel.<p><b>even as far as Gilead</b><br>Gilead was a fertile region known for its balm and rich pastures, located north of the Arnon Valley. It was a significant area for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The reference to Gilead indicates the extent of the territory conquered by the Israelites, fulfilling God's promise to give them a land flowing with milk and honey. This conquest also foreshadows the future settlement of these tribes in the Transjordan area.<p><b>not one city had walls too high for us</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous nature of Israel's victories, as fortified cities with high walls were typically difficult to conquer. The statement reflects the divine assistance provided to the Israelites, reminiscent of the fall of Jericho's walls. It underscores the theme of God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, as well as the importance of trusting in His provision.<p><b>The LORD our God gave us all of them</b><br>This declaration attributes the success of the conquests entirely to God's intervention. It emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God acts as the divine warrior on behalf of His people. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land. It points to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan and foreshadows the ultimate victory through Jesus Christ, who conquers sin and death for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aroer.htm">Aroer</a></b><br>A city located on the edge of the Arnon Valley, marking the southern boundary of the territory conquered by the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon_valley.htm">Arnon Valley</a></b><br>A significant geographical feature that served as a boundary between Moab and the Amorite territory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region known for its balm, located north of the Arnon Valley, representing the extent of the Israelite conquest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is credited with giving the Israelites victory over their enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, who are in the process of conquering the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_victory.htm">God's Sovereignty in Victory</a></b><br>The passage highlights that the victories of the Israelites were not due to their own strength but because "The LORD our God gave us all of them."
