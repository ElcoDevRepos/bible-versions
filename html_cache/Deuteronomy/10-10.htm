Moses' time on the mountain parallels the forty days and nights of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This period emphasizes the completeness and sufficiency of the time spent in God's presence. The mountain, likely Mount Sinai, is a place of divine revelation and covenant, where Moses received the Law.<p><b>like the first time</b><br>This refers to Moses' initial ascent to receive the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). The repetition underscores the importance of the covenant and God's willingness to renew it despite Israel's sin with the golden calf (Exodus 32). It highlights God's mercy and the opportunity for repentance and restoration.<p><b>and that time the LORD again listened to me</b><br>Moses' intercession for Israel is a key theme, demonstrating the power of prayer and the role of a mediator. This anticipates the ultimate mediation of Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), who intercedes on behalf of humanity. God's willingness to listen reflects His grace and readiness to forgive, aligning with His character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>.<p><b>and agreed not to destroy you</b><br>This phrase underscores God's mercy and patience. Despite Israel's rebellion, God chooses not to execute judgment, illustrating His covenant faithfulness. This act of divine forbearance is echoed in other instances, such as Jonah's mission to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who saves humanity from spiritual destruction (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
