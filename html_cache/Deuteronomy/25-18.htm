The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe known for their hostility towards Israel. This meeting was not a friendly encounter but an ambush, highlighting the Amalekites' aggressive nature. The journey of the Israelites was a significant event, marking their transition from slavery to becoming a nation under God's covenant.<p><b>when you were tired and weary</b><br>The Israelites were physically exhausted from their long journey through the desert. This state of fatigue made them vulnerable to attack. The desert journey was a test of faith and endurance, often symbolizing the trials believers face in their spiritual walk. The weariness of the Israelites can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual exhaustion, where vigilance is required to withstand the enemy's attacks.<p><b>and they attacked all your stragglers</b><br>The Amalekites targeted the weakest members of the Israelite community, those who lagged behind due to fatigue or infirmity. This tactic reveals the Amalekites' cowardice and lack of honor. In a broader spiritual sense, it serves as a warning to protect the vulnerable within the community of faith. This attack is reminiscent of how spiritual adversaries often target those who are isolated or weak in faith.<p><b>they had no fear of God</b><br>The Amalekites' actions demonstrated a blatant disregard for the God of Israel. In biblical terms, the fear of God is associated with wisdom and righteousness. Their lack of fear signifies moral corruption and a rejection of divine authority. This phrase underscores the Amalekites' role as antagonists in the biblical narrative, representing those who oppose God's people and His purposes. This lack of fear contrasts with the call for believers to live in reverence and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that attacked the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt.

The nation was fresh out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-13</a>), following God&#8217;s pillar of cloud and fire, and moving toward the promise He had literally guaranteed. This first phrase highlights:<p>&#8226;Amalek&#8217;s initiative&#8212;he came looking for Israel, not the other way around (compare <a href="/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>).<p>&#8226;The setting&#8212;the &#8220;journey&#8221; through the wilderness where Israel was learning daily dependence on God through manna, water from the rock, and the giving of the Law (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226;A call to remember&#8212;God commands His people never to forget this ambush (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17</a>).

Amalek&#8217;s godlessness showed itself in:<p>&#8226;Fighting a people whose God had just defeated Egypt&#8217;s gods with ten undeniable plagues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226;Ignoring the evidence of the Red Sea crossing (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226;Choosing cruelty over compassion&#8212;the opposite of God&#8217;s own character (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>).<p>Because Amalek displayed contempt for both humanity and the Lord, God decreed their eventual obliteration (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>, <a href="/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1, 9</a>:24-25).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a> confronts us with Amalek&#8217;s calculated ambush, Israel&#8217;s vulnerability, the targeting of society&#8217;s weakest, and the ultimate root issue&#8212;no fear of God.
