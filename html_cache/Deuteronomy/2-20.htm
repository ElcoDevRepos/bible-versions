The term "Rephaim" is used in various parts of the Old Testament to describe formidable warriors or inhabitants of the land before the Israelites. This phrase indicates that the land in question was once inhabited by these mighty people, suggesting a history of powerful and possibly intimidating occupants. The Rephaim are mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>, where they are depicted as significant adversaries. Their presence in the land underscores the challenges faced by the Israelites as they sought to claim the territories promised to them by God.<p><b>who used to live there</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Rephaim were no longer present in the land at the time of the narrative. Their absence could be attributed to various factors, such as displacement by other groups, divine intervention, or natural decline. The past tense suggests a change in the region's demographic and power dynamics, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God preparing the land for His chosen people. The removal or defeat of such formidable inhabitants would have been seen as a testament to God's power and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>though the Ammonites called them Zamzummites</b><br>The Ammonites, descendants of Lot, had their own name for the Rephaim, calling them Zamzummites. This name might reflect a cultural or linguistic difference in how these people were perceived or remembered by neighboring groups. The term "Zamzummites" could imply a particular characteristic or reputation, possibly related to their strength or the fear they inspired. The distinction in names highlights the diverse perspectives and interactions among ancient Near Eastern peoples. It also illustrates the complexity of the region's history, where various tribes and nations had their own narratives and terminologies for the same groups. This diversity is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>, where different names and descriptions are used for similar peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rephaim.htm">Rephaim</a></b><br>An ancient group of people often described as giants in the Old Testament.

Yet Moses pauses to remind the people that this same ground had once belonged to the formidable Rephaim. These were literal, physically imposing giants who had spread through Canaan and its fringes (<a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; 13:12). By noting that Ammon&#8217;s land &#8220;too&#8221; had been their realm, Scripture shows:<p>&#8226; The sheer size of Rephaim territory&#8212;stretching from Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>) down into Ammon&#8212;making God&#8217;s earlier victories all the more impressive.<p>&#8226; A pattern: God assigns borders to nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>). If He once gave Ammon possession of giant&#8208;occupied land, Israel can trust Him to hand over Canaan at the right time (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; A confidence boost: What seemed impossible had already happened nearby. If the Rephaim could fall to Ammon, the Anakim in Canaan would crumble before Israel (<a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who used to live there</b><p>The phrase underlines finality. The giants were not merely pushed aside; they were eradicated as a people group (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-21.htm">Deuteronomy 2:21</a>). Consider the chain of events:<p>&#8226; God &#8220;destroyed them before the Ammonites&#8221; (v. 21). The victory was God&#8217;s doing, even though Ammon swung the swords.<p>&#8226; Ammonites &#8220;drove them out and settled in their place&#8221; (v. 21). A total transfer of residence, proving that the Lord can permanently displace the strongest foes.<p>&#8226; The Rephaim are now a historical footnote. Their gigantic size could not preserve them from judgment&#8212;an echo of the Flood narrative where physical might also failed (<a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>).<p>For Israel, the lesson is practical: any enemy, no matter how intimidating, can become a &#8220;used to live there&#8221; once God intervenes (<a href="/psalms/46-6.htm">Psalm 46:6&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though the Ammonites called them Zamzummites</b><p>Different peoples used different names, yet they pointed to the same race of giants. This small linguistic detail offers big theological takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word recognizes cultural diversity yet unifies the story. Moses reports the Ammonite nickname so hearers grasp local memory while trusting the Spirit&#8208;given record.<p>&#8226; The Ammonite label (&#8220;Zamzummites&#8221;) shows the giants were well known and feared; every tribe had its own vocabulary for terror. Still, those fears proved groundless once the Lord overthrew them.<p>&#8226; By preserving both names, Scripture underscores historical accuracy. Real places, real nations, real linguistics&#8212;no myth, but a verifiable account (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20</a> reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God has already demonstrated His power over the mightiest of opponents. He assigns territories, removes the swaggering Rephaim, and settles Ammon in their stead. The verse quietly shouts that no obstacle is too great when the Lord decides to move. Giants may gain legendary status and multiple nicknames, but they become ancient history once God acts.
