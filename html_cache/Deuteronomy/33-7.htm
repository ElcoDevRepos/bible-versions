Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, holds significant importance as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. The tribe's prominence is highlighted throughout the Old Testament, and this blessing underscores its future leadership role among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>O LORD, hear the cry of Judah</b><br>This plea for God to hear Judah's cry reflects the tribe's need for divine assistance and guidance. Historically, Judah often found itself in conflict with surrounding nations and internal strife. The cry for help is a recurring theme in the Psalms and other scriptures, emphasizing reliance on God in times of trouble (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>). It also foreshadows the prayers of the kings of Judah, such as Hezekiah, who sought God's intervention.<p><b>and bring him to his people.</b><br>This phrase suggests a desire for unity and restoration. Historically, Judah was often separated from the other tribes, especially during the divided kingdom period. The call to bring Judah to his people can be seen as a prophetic hope for reunification and peace among the tribes, which is partially realized in the New Testament through the unifying work of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>With his own hands he defends his cause,</b><br>Judah is depicted as a tribe capable of self-defense and leadership. This reflects the historical reality of Judah's military prowess and its role as a leader among the tribes. The phrase also points to the future kingship of David and the Davidic line, which would defend and lead Israel. It highlights the balance between human effort and divine assistance in achieving victory.<p><b>but may You be a help against his foes.</b><br>This final plea acknowledges that despite Judah's strength, ultimate victory depends on God's help. It reflects the biblical principle that success in battle and life comes from the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). This reliance on God is a theme throughout the Old Testament and is exemplified in the life of King David, who consistently sought God's guidance and help against his enemies. The phrase also points to the ultimate victory over spiritual foes through Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah.

The verse assures us that the LORD hears, restores, empowers, and ultimately delivers&#8212;truths fulfilled in the reign of David and perfected in Jesus Christ, our victorious Lion of Judah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And this </span>(he said)<span class= "bld"> of Judah.</span>--The words which follow are a kingly blessing: "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people." In other words, when we think of "the Lion of the tribe of Judah," "Thy kingdom come." Rashi reminds us of the many prayers in Old Testament history which were heard from Judah's lips. The prayers of David and Solomon; of Asa and Jehoshaphat; of Hezekiah against Sennacherib;--and, we may add, of King Manasseh, and Daniel the prophet--were all "the voice of Judah." The last line of Old Testament <span class= "ital">history </span>is a prayer of Judah by the mouth of Nehemiah, "Remember me, O my God, for good." The psalms of David, again, are all "the voice of Judah." And, best of all, every prayer of our Lord's is "the voice of Judah" also. The remainder of the blessing is easily understood. The "hands" of Judah embrace those Hands which were "sufficient" for the salvation of mankind. "His enemies" include all, even to Death, the "last enemy," whom God shall subdue under His feet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The blessing on Judah is in the form of prayer to Jehovah.
