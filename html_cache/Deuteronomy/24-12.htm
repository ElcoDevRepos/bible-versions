The Mosaic Law often provided specific instructions to protect the vulnerable, including the poor, widows, and orphans (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-27</a>). The emphasis on the poor reflects God's concern for justice and compassion, as seen throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>).<p><b>you must not go to sleep</b><br>The directive not to sleep with the security in possession underscores the urgency and immediacy of returning a pledge. This reflects the cultural practice of using personal items, such as a cloak, as collateral for loans. The law required that such items be returned by sunset, emphasizing the importance of daily sustenance and dignity for the borrower (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>).<p><b>with the security in your possession;</b><br>The security, often a cloak or garment, was essential for warmth and protection, especially for the poor who might not have another covering (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>). This law ensured that the lender acted with mercy and fairness, recognizing the humanity and needs of the borrower. It also foreshadows the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and compassion for one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). The principle of returning the pledge aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and mercy, as seen in the prophets' calls for righteousness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the laws, God's chosen people, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, where these laws will be applied.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/poor_man.htm">Poor Man</a></b><br>Represents the vulnerable and needy within the community, whom the law seeks to protect.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/security/pledge.htm">Security/Pledge</a></b><br>An item given as collateral for a loan, often a garment or cloak, which is essential for the poor man's survival.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassionate_justice.htm">Compassionate Justice</a></b><br>The law reflects God's heart for justice and compassion, especially towards the poor.

In an agrarian society a cloak could double as nighttime covering (<a href="/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>), so withholding it past bedtime would jeopardize health and dignity.<p>&#8226; The principle reaches beyond collateral: any delay in doing good is disobedience (<a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27-28</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>).
