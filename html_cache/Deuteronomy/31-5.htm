It reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promises to give them victory over their enemies. This is consistent with earlier promises in Deuteronomy and throughout the Pentateuch, where God assures Israel of His support in conquering the Promised Land. The phrase also echoes the assurance given to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>, where God promises to be with him as He was with Moses. This divine intervention is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting God's faithfulness and power.<p><b>and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. The Israelites are reminded that their success is contingent upon their adherence to God's instructions. This reflects the covenant stipulations found in Deuteronomy, where blessings are promised for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The specific commands likely refer to the instructions given in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>, where God commands the Israelites to destroy the Canaanite nations completely to avoid idolatry and moral corruption. This obedience is not only a test of faith but also a means to maintain the purity and holiness of the nation. The call to follow God's commands foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on obedience to Christ's teachings, as seen in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commands."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering his final instructions to the people before they enter the Promised Land.
