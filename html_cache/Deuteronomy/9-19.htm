God's wrath is often depicted as a response to sin and disobedience, emphasizing His holiness and justice. This fear is not merely human anxiety but a recognition of God's power and authority. The fear of the Lord is a foundational concept in Scripture, seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where it is described as the beginning of wisdom.<p><b>that the LORD had directed against you,</b><br>The Israelites' idolatry with the golden calf (Exodus 32) provoked God's anger. This phrase highlights the direct relationship between the people's sin and God's response. It underscores the covenant relationship where disobedience leads to divine discipline. The LORD's anger is not arbitrary but a direct consequence of the people's actions, reflecting the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>enough to destroy you.</b><br>The severity of God's wrath is such that it could lead to the complete destruction of the nation. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a> about the consequences of breaking the covenant. The potential for destruction serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance. It also foreshadows the eventual exile of Israel due to continued disobedience.<p><b>But the LORD listened to me</b><br>Moses' intercession is a powerful example of the role of a mediator. His prayers on behalf of the people demonstrate the effectiveness of intercession and God's willingness to relent from sending disaster. This anticipates the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who intercedes for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). Moses' role as an intercessor is a type of Christ, pointing to the greater mediation to come.<p><b>this time as well.</b><br>This phrase indicates that God had previously listened to Moses' intercession, as seen in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>. It highlights God's mercy and patience, showing that He is willing to forgive and restore. The repetition of God's willingness to listen underscores His character as compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in love (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>).
