In the ancient Israelite context, education was primarily the responsibility of the family, particularly the parents. The Hebrew word for "teach diligently" implies a sharpening or engraving, suggesting that these teachings should be deeply impressed upon the children. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>, which advises training a child in the way they should go. The family unit is seen as the primary context for spiritual education, reflecting the covenantal relationship between God and His people.<p><b>and speak of them when you sit at home</b><br>The home is portrayed as a central place for spiritual instruction and discussion. In ancient Israel, homes were not just physical structures but centers of family life and worship. This phrase suggests that God's commandments should be a natural part of daily conversation, integrated into the fabric of everyday life. This practice is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to let the word of Christ dwell richly among them (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p><b>and when you walk along the road</b><br>This phrase indicates that teaching and discussing God's commandments should not be confined to the home but should extend to all aspects of life, including travel and work. In the historical context, walking was a common mode of transportation, and journeys provided opportunities for teaching and reflection. This reflects the idea that God's word should guide believers in all their ways, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path.<p><b>when you lie down</b><br>The mention of lying down suggests that the day should begin and end with thoughts of God's commandments. In Jewish tradition, the Shema, which includes <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, is recited in the morning and evening, reinforcing the idea of constant meditation on God's word. This practice is mirrored in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the blessed person meditates on the law of the Lord day and night.<p><b>and when you get up</b><br>Rising in the morning is another opportunity to focus on God's commandments, setting the tone for the day. This continual engagement with God's word is a form of spiritual discipline, ensuring that His teachings are ever-present in the believer's life. The practice of morning devotion is seen throughout scripture, as in <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>, where Jesus rises early to pray, demonstrating the importance of starting the day with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's laws and commandments to the people.
