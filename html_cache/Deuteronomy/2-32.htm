The Amorites were known for their strength and were often seen as a formidable enemy. This phrase highlights the totality of Sihon's commitment to the battle, as he brought his entire army. This reflects the seriousness of the confrontation and the threat posed to the Israelites. Historically, the Amorites were a dominant force in the region, and their defeat would have been seen as a significant victory for Israel.<p><b>came out for battle</b><br>The act of coming out for battle indicates a proactive and aggressive stance by Sihon. This was not a defensive maneuver but an offensive one, suggesting confidence in his military strength. In the ancient Near Eastern context, battles were often seen as not just physical confrontations but also spiritual ones, where the gods of each nation were believed to be fighting alongside their people. This battle, therefore, was not just against Israel but against the God of Israel.<p><b>against us</b><br>The "us" refers to the Israelites, who were journeying towards the Promised Land. This confrontation was part of their divinely ordained conquest of Canaan. The Israelites, under Moses' leadership, were following God's command to take possession of the land promised to their forefathers. This battle was a step in fulfilling that promise, demonstrating God's faithfulness and the unfolding of His plan for His people.<p><b>at Jahaz</b><br>Jahaz was a location east of the Jordan River, in the territory that would later be part of the tribe of Reuben. The specific mention of Jahaz provides a geographical marker for the event, situating it within the broader narrative of Israel's journey. Archaeologically, while the exact location of Jahaz is debated, it is generally associated with the region of Moab. This battle at Jahaz was a pivotal moment in Israel's conquest, as it marked the beginning of their victories over the Canaanite kings, leading to their eventual settlement in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.

His name immediately signals a clash between human pride and divine promise, much like Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a> or Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>. Each time a ruler opposes God&#8217;s people, the Lord turns the confrontation into a platform to reveal His power (<a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his whole army</b><p>The text stresses &#8220;his whole army,&#8221; underscoring that Sihon threw every resource into resisting Israel. It mirrors how nations later mustered &#8220;all their forces&#8221; against Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-2</a>) or how Midian swarmed &#8220;as numerous as locusts&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>). The enemy&#8217;s full strength only magnifies God&#8217;s victory, reminding us that &#8220;no king is saved by the size of his army&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came out</b><p>Sihon is the aggressor; he &#8220;came out.&#8221; Israel did not pick this fight. Earlier God had forbidden conflict with Edom and Moab (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-9</a>), proving He is no warmonger. When opposition forces the issue, however, the Lord steps in (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). Like Pharaoh chasing Israel into the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8-9</a>), Sihon&#8217;s advance becomes the moment God turns the tables.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For battle</b><p>This was not a skirmish but formal war. The phrase recalls Israel&#8217;s future battles at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3-5</a>) and Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-2</a>). Yet every fight fits the pattern of <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>: &#8220;The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.&#8221; Spiritual warfare today follows the same principle&#8212;our armor is God-given, not self-made (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against us</b><p>The &#8220;us&#8221; is covenant Israel, the people redeemed from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). To attack them is to challenge God Himself, as <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> puts it: &#8220;He who touches you touches the apple of His eye.&#8221; This covenant identity grounds believers now, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At Jahaz</b><p>Jahaz becomes the stage where promise meets fulfillment. Centuries later, Isaiah cites this very site when foretelling Moab&#8217;s downfall (<a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>), linking geography to theology&#8212;God&#8217;s deeds in place and time. Jahaz reminds us that divine faithfulness is concrete, not abstract; He acts in real history as in Bethlehem (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>) and Calvary (<a href="/luke/23-33.htm">Luke 23:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32</a> shows an earthly king mobilizing everything he has, yet unwittingly positioning himself for defeat by the living God. Sihon&#8217;s total commitment to opposition only highlights the total superiority of the Lord&#8217;s promises. When the enemy &#8220;comes out&#8221; in full force, God&#8217;s people can rest in the assurance that every Jahaz becomes another milestone proclaiming, &#8220;His love endures forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32</span> (cf. <a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). - <span class="cmt_word">Jahaz</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>, downtrodden), elsewhere Jahazah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), a city of Moab, afterwards assigned to the tribe of Reuben, and allotted to the priests (<a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>;
