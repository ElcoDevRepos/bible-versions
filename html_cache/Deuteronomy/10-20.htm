This fear is not about terror but reverence and awe for God's holiness, power, and authority. In the ancient Near Eastern context, fear of a deity was common, but the Israelites were called to a unique relationship with Yahweh, characterized by love and obedience. This fear is foundational to wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and is the beginning of knowledge (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). It reflects a deep respect and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and justice.<p><b>and serve Him.</b><br>Service to God in the Old Testament often involved worship, sacrifices, and obedience to His commandments. The Hebrew word for "serve" can also mean "worship," indicating that true service to God is an act of worship. This service is exclusive, as seen in the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), and is a response to God's deliverance and covenant relationship with Israel. Jesus reiterates this principle in <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>, emphasizing that worship and service are due to God alone.<p><b>Hold fast to Him</b><br>Holding fast to God implies loyalty and commitment. In the covenantal context, it means clinging to God and His commandments, rejecting idolatry and other allegiances. This phrase suggests a relationship akin to a marriage, where faithfulness and devotion are paramount. <a href="/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a> echoes this sentiment, urging Israel to cling to the LORD as they had done in the past. It is a call to steadfastness in faith and practice.<p><b>and take your oaths in His name.</b><br>Oaths in the ancient world were serious commitments, often invoking a deity as a witness to the truth of one's words. By instructing the Israelites to take oaths in God's name, the text underscores the importance of truthfulness and integrity. It also highlights the exclusivity of their relationship with Yahweh, as oaths were not to be made in the names of other gods. Jesus later addresses the issue of oaths in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, emphasizing honesty and the importance of one's word without the need for swearing by anything.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, Moses is delivering God's commandments to the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving these instructions as part of the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants, and where the Israelites are about to enter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/yahweh.htm">Yahweh (The LORD)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Law from God, which forms the backdrop for the covenantal instructions in Deuteronomy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the LORD</a></b><br>The fear of the LORD is foundational to a life of faith.
