The Hebrew word for love here, "ahav," implies a deep, covenantal loyalty and affection. This love is not merely emotional but involves commitment and obedience. The call to love God is foundational in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which Jesus cites as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). The love for God is a response to His love and faithfulness, as demonstrated in the deliverance from Egypt and the giving of the Law.<p><b>and always keep His charge</b><br>The term "charge" refers to the responsibilities and duties given by God. It implies a stewardship of the covenant relationship. This phrase underscores the perpetual nature of obedience, suggesting that faithfulness to God is not a one-time act but a continual commitment. The idea of keeping God's charge is echoed in the priestly duties described in Leviticus and Numbers, where the priests are charged with maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle and the offerings.<p><b>His statutes</b><br>Statutes are specific decrees or laws given by God. They are often seen as permanent regulations that govern the life of the community. In the context of Deuteronomy, these statutes are part of the covenantal law given at Sinai and reiterated on the plains of Moab. They include moral, ceremonial, and civil laws that set Israel apart as God's holy people. The psalmist frequently speaks of delighting in God's statutes (Psalm 119), indicating their role in guiding righteous living.<p><b>His ordinances</b><br>Ordinances refer to judicial decisions or judgments that provide guidance for specific situations. They are often case laws that apply the principles of the statutes to particular circumstances. These ordinances reflect God's justice and righteousness and are intended to maintain order and fairness within the community. The book of Exodus (chapters 21-23) contains many such ordinances, illustrating how God's law addresses various aspects of daily life.<p><b>and His commandments</b><br>Commandments are direct orders from God that require obedience. The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) are the most well-known example, serving as a summary of God's moral law. These commandments are not burdensome but are given for the well-being of God's people, as they reflect His holy character. Jesus affirmed the enduring relevance of God's commandments, teaching that love for Him is demonstrated through obedience (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<br><br>In summary, <a href="/deuteronomy/11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:1</a> calls for a holistic devotion to God, encompassing love, obedience, and adherence to His comprehensive law. This verse encapsulates the covenant relationship between God and Israel, which is fulfilled in Christ, who perfectly loved and obeyed the Father, and through whom believers are empowered to do the same.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live in obedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are preparing to enter, contingent on their obedience to God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God originally gave the law to Moses, establishing the covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, requiring their obedience in exchange for His blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_the_foundation.htm">Love as the Foundation</a></b><br>Loving God is the foundation of our relationship with Him.
