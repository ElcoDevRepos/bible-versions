This division highlights the stages of preparation, calling, and fulfillment in his life. The number 120 is also seen as a symbol of completion in biblical numerology. Moses' age at death reflects God's sovereign timing and the fulfillment of his mission. His life span is consistent with the longevity of other patriarchs, though it marks the end of an era as lifespans decrease in subsequent generations.<p><b>yet his eyes were not weak</b><br>This phrase indicates that Moses retained his physical strength and clarity of vision until his death. It suggests divine preservation and blessing, as diminished eyesight was common in old age. The preservation of his sight symbolizes spiritual insight and leadership ability, which Moses maintained throughout his life. It also underscores the miraculous nature of his life, as he was able to see the Promised Land from Mount Nebo, though he was not permitted to enter it.<p><b>and his vitality had not diminished</b><br>Moses' undiminished vitality at 120 years old is a testament to God's sustaining power. It signifies that Moses remained vigorous and capable, both physically and spiritually, until the end of his life. This vitality is a reflection of his close relationship with God and his role as a prophet and leader. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, though crucified, demonstrated ultimate strength and life through His resurrection. Moses' enduring strength is a reminder of the potential for divine empowerment in fulfilling God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Moses is the leader of the Israelites who led them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Moses&#8217; physical clarity mirrors his undimmed vision of God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier he climbed Nebo and &#8220;the LORD showed him all the land&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). Healthy eyes enabled him to view the inheritance he could not enter, affirming God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Compare Isaac, whose &#8220;eyes were so dim that he could not see&#8221; at old age (<a href="/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>). Moses stands in contrast, reinforcing that obedience preserves vitality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a> reminds us, &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.&#8221; Moses&#8217; clear eyes reflect a life lived in constant revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his vitality had not diminished</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, &#8220;and his vitality had not diminished&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical vigor at such age underlines supernatural preservation. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a> promises, &#8220;As your days, so shall your strength be,&#8221; exemplified in Moses.<p>&#8226; Caleb offers a parallel: at eighty-five he declares, &#8220;I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10-11</a>).

He spends his last hours blessing Israel (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>) and passing leadership to Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>), showing strength directed to service until his final breath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a> presents Moses as a man whose lifespan, eyesight, and energy were all miraculously preserved. His exact 120 years fulfill divine design; his clear eyes signify undimmed spiritual perception; his undiminished vigor evidences God&#8217;s sustaining power. Together these details spotlight a faithful God who equips His servant fully until the mission is complete, encouraging believers to trust that He can likewise supply every needed strength until our work is finished.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Though Moses had reached the age of a hundred and twenty years, his eye had not become dim, nor were the juices of his body dried. <span class="cmt_word">Natural force.</span> The word so rendered (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>) occurs only here; but it is doubtless the subst. connected with the adj. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> moist, fresh (cf. <a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>), and properly means moisture, freshness.
