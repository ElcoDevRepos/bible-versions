This title underscores his humility and dedication to God's commands. Moses' life and leadership are pivotal in the narrative of the Israelites, as he led them out of Egypt and through the wilderness. His role as a servant is a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who is also described as a servant in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, emphasizing humility and obedience to God's will.<p><b>died there in the land of Moab</b><br>The land of Moab is located east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. This area was outside the Promised Land, which Moses was not permitted to enter due to his disobedience at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>). The death of Moses in Moab signifies the end of an era for the Israelites, as they stand on the brink of entering the land promised to their ancestors. This moment marks a transition in leadership to Joshua, who will lead the people into Canaan. The location of Moses' death also fulfills God's word, demonstrating the importance of obedience and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>as the LORD had said</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of God's word and promises. God had previously informed Moses that he would not enter the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-48.htm">Deuteronomy 32:48-52</a>). The fulfillment of this word serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His promises. It also reflects the theme of divine justice and mercy, as Moses is allowed to see the land from a distance but not enter it. This moment is a testament to God's faithfulness and the importance of adhering to His commands. Moses' death, as God had said, also points to the reliability of prophetic words throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Moses is described as "the servant of the LORD."

We meet him here at the close of that third forty-year segment&#8212;still central in God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the servant of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Scripture rarely grants a higher title than &#8220;servant of the LORD.&#8221; <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a> begins, &#8220;After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;showing continuity of leadership under God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/105-26.htm">Psalm 105:26</a> looks back: &#8220;He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The designation underscores obedience and intimacy.

Each clause spotlights a facet of God&#8217;s reliability&#8212;His recognition of humble service, His control over life and death, His rooting of events in real places, and His unfailing fulfillment of every word. For every believer, the verse invites quiet confidence: to live and to die under the Lord&#8217;s direction is the highest honor and the surest hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">So (</span>better, <span class= "ital">and</span><span class= "bld">) Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">upon the mouth of the Lord, </span>and hence the Jewish interpretation that he died by a kiss! But the language of the sacred narrative is too simple to need even this interpretation. For many years it had been the habit of Moses to do everything "at the mouth of the Lord." Only one fatal mistake mars the record of obedience. It was but one last act of obedience to lie down and die at the word of Jehovah. It is extraordinary, when we consider the story of Moses' last days, how wholly self is cast aside. There is no anxiety about the unseen world, and no positive expression of hope. St. Paul says far more than Moses about his prospects in the life to come. To Moses, death is a source of anxiety on account of his people, and a source of pain to himself, because he cannot go over Jordan and see the works of Jehovah on the other side. Beyond this, his reticence is absolute, and his calm silence is sublime. But he died in the company of Jehovah, and may well have felt that he would not lose His presence in the other world. "Underneath were the everlasting arms," as he had said but just before. Jehovah was with him, and he feared no evil. He was so fearless, that it does not seem to have occurred to him to say that he did not fear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">at the mouth of the Lord</span>.
