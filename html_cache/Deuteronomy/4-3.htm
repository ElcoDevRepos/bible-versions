The phrase emphasizes the firsthand witness of the Israelites to God's judgment, serving as a powerful reminder of His holiness and intolerance of idolatry. The event at Baal-peor is a stark warning against turning away from God, highlighting the consequences of disobedience. It underscores the importance of faithfulness to God, as the Israelites were called to be a holy nation set apart for His purposes.<p><b>for the LORD your God destroyed from among you</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's direct intervention in purging the community of those who sinned. It reflects the seriousness with which God views idolatry and the lengths He will go to maintain the purity of His people. The destruction of the guilty parties serves as a sobering reminder of divine justice. It also illustrates the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience, and disobedience leads to severe consequences.<p><b>all who followed Baal of Peor</b><br>Baal of Peor was a local deity worshiped by the Moabites, and the Israelites' involvement with this idol represented a breach of their covenant with God. The phrase indicates that those who turned to this false god were completely removed from the community, demonstrating the exclusivity of worship that God demands. This event foreshadows the New Testament teaching of separation from sin and the call to holiness found in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>. It also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and idolatry, as He calls His followers to worship God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Moses is addressing the Israelites, reminding them of past events to instruct and warn them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' speech, they are the chosen people of God who witnessed the events at Baal-peor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal-peor.htm">Baal-peor</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites fell into idolatry and immorality, worshiping the Moabite god Baal, which led to God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal_of_peor.htm">Baal of Peor</a></b><br>A false deity worshiped by the Moabites, representing fertility and associated with licentious practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who executed judgment on those who turned to idolatry at Baal-peor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.
