The Israelites were instructed to spare the women and children, which reflects a measure of mercy compared to the total destruction commanded in other instances (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-17</a>). This directive aligns with the cultural norms of the time, where victors would claim the possessions and people of a defeated city. The inclusion of livestock and other goods as plunder indicates the economic aspect of warfare, where resources were vital for the survival and prosperity of the victors. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the conquest of Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>).<p><b>and you shall use the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God gives you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the victory and subsequent plunder are gifts from God, underscoring the belief that God is sovereign over the outcomes of battles. The Israelites were to recognize that their success was not solely due to their own strength or strategy but was granted by divine intervention. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, where David acknowledges that "the battle is the LORD's." Theologically, this reflects the idea that God provides for His people, even through the means of warfare, and that they are to depend on Him for their needs. This provision can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides for the spiritual needs of His people through His victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
