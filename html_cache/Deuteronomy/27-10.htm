In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. Obedience to God's voice is not just about following rules but about maintaining a covenant relationship with Him. The "voice of the LORD" can be understood as His direct communication through prophets, the written Law, and the inner conviction of the Holy Spirit. This call to obedience is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus states, "If you love me, keep my commands" (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>and follow His commandments and statutes</b><br>The commandments and statutes refer to the laws given by God to the Israelites, which include moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. These laws were designed to set Israel apart as a holy nation and to guide them in righteous living. The emphasis on following these laws highlights the importance of living according to God's standards. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the idea that God's laws are not burdensome but are meant to lead to life and blessing (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a>). The New Testament reiterates this principle, as seen in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which encourages believers to be doers of the word, not just hearers.<p><b>I am giving you today.</b><br>The immediacy of "today" underscores the urgency and relevance of God's commandments. It suggests that obedience is not a future consideration but a present responsibility. This reflects the historical context of the Israelites on the brink of entering Canaan, where they would face new challenges and temptations. The phrase also implies that God's instructions are timely and applicable to the current situation of His people. In a prophetic sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills the Law and the Prophets and calls His followers to a new covenant of grace and truth (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments to the people.
