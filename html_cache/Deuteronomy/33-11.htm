In the context of <a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, Moses is blessing the tribes of Israel before his death. The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they relied on the offerings and tithes from the people (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). This blessing asks for God's favor on their material needs, ensuring they have what is necessary to fulfill their priestly duties. The concept of God blessing one's substance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>, where the psalmist asks for God's favor on the work of their hands.<p><b>and accept the work of his hands.</b><br>This part of the blessing emphasizes the importance of God accepting the Levites' service and offerings. The "work of his hands" refers to the priestly duties, including sacrifices, teaching the law, and maintaining the tabernacle or temple. Acceptance by God is crucial, as seen in the story of Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3-5</a>), where God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's. The Levites' work was central to Israel's worship and spiritual life, and this prayer seeks divine approval and effectiveness in their ministry. This acceptance is a precursor to the ultimate acceptance found in Christ, whose sacrifice is fully accepted by God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<p><b>Smash the loins of those who rise against him,</b><br>This phrase is a call for divine protection against adversaries. The "loins" symbolize strength and power, and to "smash" them implies a decisive defeat. Historically, the Levites faced opposition from within Israel, such as the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16), and from external enemies. This prayer seeks God's intervention to protect the Levites from those who would oppose their God-given role. The imagery of God as a warrior defending His people is common in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, where God is described as a "man of war."<p><b>and of his foes so they can rise no more.</b><br>The final phrase underscores the desire for a complete and lasting victory over enemies. This reflects the biblical theme of God's ultimate triumph over evil, as seen in the eschatological promises of Revelation, where Christ defeats all His foes (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>). For the Levites, this assurance of protection and victory would enable them to serve without fear, knowing that God is their defender. This also points to the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, ensuring that His followers can stand firm in their faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering blessings to the tribes of Israel before his death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>The tribe being blessed in this verse, known for their priestly duties and service to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, invoked to bless and protect the tribe of Levi.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_levi.htm">Enemies of Levi</a></b><br>Those who oppose or hate the tribe, whom Moses asks God to defeat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to which the tribe of Levi belongs, receiving Moses' final blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_intercession.htm">The Role of Intercession</a></b><br>Moses intercedes for the tribe of Levi, highlighting the power and importance of intercessory prayer for others, especially those in spiritual leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_blessing.htm">God's Provision and Blessing</a></b><br>The request for God to bless Levi's substance and work underscores the belief that all provision and success come from God.
