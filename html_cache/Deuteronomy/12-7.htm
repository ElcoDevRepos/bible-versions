This centralization of worship was intended to unify the Israelites and prevent idolatry. The presence of the LORD signifies His holiness and the sacredness of the location, reminding the Israelites of God's omnipresence and His covenant relationship with them.<p><b>you and your households</b><br>The inclusion of households highlights the communal aspect of worship and celebration. It underscores the importance of family in the spiritual life of Israel, where faith and religious practices are passed down through generations. This communal worship fosters unity and shared faith experiences, reinforcing the covenant community.<p><b>shall eat and rejoice</b><br>Eating and rejoicing are integral parts of worship and celebration in the Old Testament. Feasting in the presence of God symbolizes fellowship and gratitude for His provision. Rejoicing reflects the joy that comes from being in right relationship with God and experiencing His blessings. This practice foreshadows the Messianic banquet and the joy found in Christ.<p><b>in all you do</b><br>This phrase suggests that every aspect of life is to be lived in gratitude and joy before God. It implies that worship is not confined to rituals but extends to daily activities, encouraging a holistic approach to faith where all actions are done for God's glory. This aligns with the New Testament teaching of doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus.<p><b>because the LORD your God has blessed you</b><br>The blessings of God are the foundation for the Israelites' joy and worship. This phrase acknowledges God's provision and faithfulness, reminding the Israelites of their dependence on Him. It also serves as a call to remember God's past faithfulness as motivation for present obedience and future trust. The blessings are both material and spiritual, pointing to the ultimate blessing found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to worship and live in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where the Israelites are to settle and worship God according to His commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who blesses and provides for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/households.htm">Households</a></b><br>The family units of the Israelites, who are to partake in communal worship and celebration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_in_community.htm">Worship in Community</a></b><br>God designed worship to be a communal activity, where families and communities come together to celebrate His blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_presence.htm">Joy in God's Presence</a></b><br>True joy and fulfillment are found in the presence of the LORD.

There it seems as if the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the flesh was to be given to the priest. "And the flesh of them shall be thine [the priest's], as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine." This may be taken to mean that just as the wave breast and the right shoulder are the perquisites of the priests in the case of other offerings, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the peace offering, so in the case of the firstling offering the whole flesh shall be the priest's; and thus taken, the passage presents an unquestionable discrepancy to that in Deuteronomy. But probably the passage is not to be so taken. The particle translated "as" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>.) not infrequently occurs in the sense of "according to, after the manner of," implying conformity to some rule or model (<a href="/genesis/44-2.htm">Genesis 44:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-4.htm">Numbers 8:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-3.htm">Numbers 9:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-18.htm">Numbers 29:18</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Zechariah 2:10 [Zechariah 2:6], etc.). The passage, therefore, may be rendered thus: <span class="accented">And the flesh of them shalt thou take after the manner</span> (<span class="accented">or according to the rule</span>), of the wave breast, etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the whole of it, but only these parts. So the LXX. seem to have taken the passage: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Of some of the offerings the whole was received by the priest, as in the case of the sin offering and trespass offering (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, etc.; Leviticus 7:1, etc.); while of others only certain portions, viz. the wave breast and the heave shoulder, were given to him, as in the case of the peace offering (<a href="/leviticus/7-28.htm">Leviticus 7:28</a>, etc.). The purport of the law in <a href="/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a> is that, in respect of the firstling offering, the allotment to the priest shall be after the same manner as in the peace offering. There is thus no discrepancy between the two passages. The animal belonged originally to the offerer; when he brought it before the Lord part of it was consumed on the altar, part of it was assigned to the priest, and the rest, as a matter of course, remained with himself. The law in Numbers, addressed to the priest, intimates what he might claim as his portion; the law in Deuteronomy, where the people are addressed, directs them how to use the portion that remained with them. It may be added that, even supposing that all the flesh was given to the priest, yet, as it had to be consumed on the day in which the sacrifice was offered, and as every clean person in the house might partake of it, it is almost certain that the offerer would, as a matter of course, share in the meal, as was usual in the case of sacrificial meals. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto</span>; enjoy whatever your hand may gain, whatever you may earn, all the good which the Lord may give you (cf. ver. 18; 15:10; 23. 20; 28:8, 20).
