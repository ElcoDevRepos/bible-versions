Mount Sinai, also known as Horeb, is traditionally located in the Sinai Peninsula. This mountain is where God revealed Himself to Moses and gave the Law. The ascent signifies Moses' role as a mediator between God and the Israelites, a type of Christ who mediates the New Covenant.<p><b>to receive the tablets of stone</b><br>The tablets of stone are the physical manifestation of God's covenant with Israel, containing the Ten Commandments. These tablets symbolize God's law and His direct communication with His people. The use of stone indicates permanence and the unchanging nature of God's commandments.<p><b>the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you</b><br>This covenant is a binding agreement between God and the Israelites, establishing them as His chosen people. It is a continuation of the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The covenant is conditional, requiring Israel's obedience to God's laws. This foreshadows the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, which is based on grace and faith.<p><b>I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights</b><br>The period of forty days and nights is significant in biblical numerology, often representing a time of testing, trial, or preparation. This duration parallels other biblical events, such as Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. It emphasizes the seriousness and solemnity of the covenant-making process.<p><b>I ate no bread and drank no water</b><br>Moses' fasting during this time indicates a supernatural sustenance provided by God, as human survival without food and water for such a period is impossible. This act of fasting signifies total dependence on God and mirrors the spiritual discipline seen in other biblical figures. It also prefigures Christ's fasting in the wilderness, highlighting themes of reliance on God and spiritual preparation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
