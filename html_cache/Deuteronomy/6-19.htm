The Canaanites, who inhabited the land, were known for their idolatry and immoral practices, which were contrary to the covenantal laws given to Israel. The conquest was not just a military campaign but a divine mandate to establish a holy nation. This act prefigures the spiritual victory believers have over sin and evil through Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>as the LORD has said</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the faithfulness of God to His promises. Throughout the Pentateuch, God repeatedly assured the Israelites of victory over their enemies (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27-31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). The fulfillment of these promises is a testament to God's sovereignty and reliability. It also serves as a reminder of the conditional nature of these promises, which required Israel's obedience and faithfulness to God's commandments. This reflects the broader biblical theme of covenant, where God's promises are often contingent upon human response (Deuteronomy 28).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The nations inhabiting Canaan, whom God promised to drive out before the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to fulfill His word.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.
