God instructed the Israelites not to harass or provoke the Ammonites because He had given their land to the descendants of Lot. This reflects God's sovereign distribution of land and His respect for the promises made to other nations. The Ammonites lived east of the Jordan River, in what is now modern-day Jordan.<p><b>or the land along the banks of the Jabbok River</b><br>The Jabbok River, known today as the Zarqa River, was a significant geographical boundary. It flows into the Jordan River and served as a natural border for the territories. The Israelites were instructed to avoid this area, respecting the boundaries set by God. This river is also historically significant as the place where Jacob wrestled with God (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-32</a>), symbolizing a place of divine encounter and transformation.<p><b>or the cities of the hill country</b><br>The hill country refers to the elevated regions east of the Jordan River. These areas were often fortified and strategically important. The Israelites' avoidance of these cities demonstrates obedience to God's command and a recognition of His authority over territorial boundaries. This obedience contrasts with later periods when Israel would struggle with following God's commands regarding other nations and territories.<p><b>or any place that the LORD our God had forbidden</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's specific instructions. The Israelites were to respect the divine boundaries set by God, which were part of His larger plan for the nation. This obedience is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also foreshadows the importance of following God's commands in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes love and obedience to God's will as central to the faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A people descended from Lot, living east of the Jordan River.
