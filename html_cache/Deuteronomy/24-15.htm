Daily payment ensured that workers could provide for their immediate needs, as many lived hand-to-mouth. The principle of timely payment is rooted in justice and compassion, emphasizing the dignity of labor. This practice is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a> and <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>, highlighting the importance of fair treatment of workers. The timing "before sunset" underscores the urgency and necessity of meeting the worker's needs promptly.<p><b>because he is poor and depends on them</b><br>The acknowledgment of the worker's poverty underscores the social responsibility to care for the vulnerable. In ancient Israel, the poor often had no safety net, making daily wages crucial for survival. This reflects God's concern for the marginalized, as seen throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22-23</a>. The dependency on wages highlights the ethical obligation to ensure that justice is not delayed, as it directly impacts the worker's ability to sustain himself and his family.<p><b>Otherwise he may cry out to the LORD against you</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine justice, where God is portrayed as the defender of the oppressed. The cry of the poor is a powerful motif in the Bible, seen in <a href="/exodus/22-23.htm">Exodus 22:23</a> and <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, where God hears and responds to the cries of those wronged. It serves as a warning that neglecting the needs of the poor is not just a social injustice but a spiritual offense that God takes seriously.<p><b>and you will be guilty of sin</b><br>The failure to pay wages promptly is not merely a breach of contract but a moral failing in the eyes of God. This underscores the biblical principle that sin is not only about personal piety but also about social ethics and justice. The guilt of sin here is tied to the mistreatment of others, reflecting the broader biblical theme that true righteousness involves right relationships with both God and neighbor, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> and <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the law, God's chosen people, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hired_worker.htm">Hired Worker</a></b><br>The subject of the law, often poor and dependent on daily wages for survival.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector of the oppressed, to whom the worker may cry out.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The context in which these laws are to be applied, emphasizing justice and righteousness in the new society.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_fairness.htm">Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>God commands His people to act justly, especially towards those who are vulnerable.
