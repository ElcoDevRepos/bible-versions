Sihon and Og were Amorite kings who ruled over significant regions. The Israelites' victory over these kings is detailed in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>. This conquest was a fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites land, demonstrating His faithfulness and power.

The defeat of these two kings was significant because it represented the overcoming of formidable adversaries. This victory was a precursor to the conquest of Canaan, symbolizing God's ability to deliver His people from powerful enemies. The Amorites' defeat is also mentioned in <a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, highlighting God's enduring faithfulness.<p><b>across the Jordan to the east</b><br>This geographical reference indicates the location of the conquered territories, which were east of the Jordan River.
