The Arnon Valley served as a natural boundary between Moab and the Amorite territory. Crossing it symbolized a transition from wandering to conquest. The directive to "arise" and "set out" emphasizes obedience and readiness to follow God's leading. The Arnon Valley, identified with the modern Wadi Mujib in Jordan, is a significant geographical marker, illustrating the Israelites' movement into new territory as part of God's promise.<p><b>See, I have delivered into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land.</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises. Sihon, the Amorite king, represents the formidable opposition Israel would face. The Amorites were known for their strength and established cities. God's declaration of having "delivered" Sihon into Israel's hands assures them of victory, highlighting divine intervention. This mirrors God's assurance to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>, where He promises to give every place the Israelites set foot. The mention of Heshbon, Sihon's capital, situates the narrative in a real historical context, with archaeological evidence supporting its existence as a significant city.<p><b>Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.</b><br>This command initiates the active phase of conquest, requiring Israel to step out in faith and action. The phrase "take possession" indicates a transfer of ownership ordained by God, aligning with the covenantal promise of land to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Engaging in battle signifies the necessary human effort in partnership with divine promise. This reflects the broader biblical theme of faith accompanied by works (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The conquest of Sihon serves as a type of Christ's victory over spiritual enemies, where believers are called to actively participate in the spiritual battles of life, assured of victory through Christ's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting God's instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The Amorite king of Heshbon, whose land God has given to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon_valley.htm">Arnon Valley</a></b><br>A geographical boundary that the Israelites are instructed to cross.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>The city ruled by King Sihon, representing the land to be conquered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Deliverance</a></b><br>God is the one who delivers enemies into the hands of His people.

Sihon and his people were Amorites, who had settled on the east of the Jordan in Gilead. But though not included in the original promise to Abraham, God had assigned this territory to the Israelites; and, therefore, he commanded the people under Moses to cross the Amen, and take the first step towards possessing the Promised Land, by assailing Sihon, King of Heshbon, assuring them that from that day he would "put the dread and fear of them upon all nations under the whole heaven," that is, all nations, wherever placed, to whom the fame of the Israelites should come (comp. <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>), so that on hearing thereof, they should tremble and writhe as in pain (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). Moses, however, in the first instance, sent a message of peace to Sihon, proposing to pass through his territory on the same terms as he had made with the Moabites and Edomites, traveling by the highway, and paying for such provisions as his followers required. But this Sihon refused, and came out against Israel, with all his people, to battle. The issue was that he was utterly discomfited; all his towns were captured, he and all his people utterly destroyed, and the cattle and spoil of the whole country taken for booty. Israel thus became possessed of that entire territory, though it did not lie within the bounds of the land promised by God to Abraham, which was the reason, probably, why Moses made overtures of peace to Sihon, and would have passed through his country amicably, had he been permitted;
