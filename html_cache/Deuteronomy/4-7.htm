In the ancient Near East, nations were often defined by their gods, and the greatness of a nation was frequently attributed to the power and presence of its deity. Israel's greatness is not in its military might or wealth but in its relationship with the LORD.<p><b>to have a god as near to them</b><br>The nearness of God to Israel is a central theme in the Old Testament. Unlike the distant and capricious gods of other nations, the LORD is intimately involved with His people. This nearness is demonstrated through the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God gave the Law and dwelt among them in the Tabernacle.<p><b>as the LORD our God is to us</b><br>The personal nature of God is emphasized here. The use of "our God" signifies a personal and covenantal relationship. This is a God who has chosen Israel, delivered them from Egypt, and given them His laws. The LORD's presence is not just a theological concept but a lived reality for the Israelites.<p><b>whenever we call on Him?</b><br>This phrase underscores the accessibility of God to His people. In contrast to the gods of other nations, who were often seen as unpredictable and unapproachable, the LORD invites His people to call upon Him. This is a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>, "The LORD is near to all who call on Him." It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of prayer and God's readiness to hear His people, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> and <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering this message to the people.
