The Israelites were called to worship God according to His commandments, not adopting the idolatrous customs of the Canaanites. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God's people are set apart (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). The command underscores the importance of worshiping God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>), avoiding syncretism.<p><b>because they practice for their gods every abomination which the LORD hates</b><br>The term "abomination" refers to practices that are detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and immorality. The Canaanite religious practices included rituals that were morally and spiritually corrupt, such as temple prostitution and child sacrifice. These actions violated the moral law given to Israel and were contrary to God's nature, who is holy and just (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The warning serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods</b><br>This phrase highlights the extreme depravity of Canaanite worship, specifically the practice of child sacrifice, which was abhorrent to God. Archaeological evidence from sites like Carthage and Gezer supports the historical reality of such practices in the ancient Near East. The prohibition against child sacrifice is reiterated in other parts of the Bible (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>), emphasizing the sanctity of life.
