In the context of Deuteronomy, these signs are a test of faithfulness to God. The Israelites were familiar with signs and wonders, having witnessed them during the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 7-12). The warning here is that even if a sign or wonder occurs, it does not automatically validate the message or the messenger. This reflects the biblical principle that not all supernatural occurrences are from God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>, where false prophets and false Christs perform great signs and wonders to deceive.<p><b>but he says, &#8220;Let us follow other gods (which you have not known) and let us worship them,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the core issue of idolatry and the temptation to follow other gods. The commandment against idolatry is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The phrase "which you have not known" emphasizes the foreign nature of these gods, contrasting with the intimate knowledge and relationship the Israelites have with Yahweh. Historically, the surrounding nations worshiped a pantheon of gods, and the Israelites were often tempted to adopt these practices, as seen in the accounts of the Canaanite gods like Baal and Asherah (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>). The call to worship other gods is a direct violation of the covenant and a test of loyalty to the one true God. This warning is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are cautioned against being led astray by false teachings (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_or_dreamers.htm">Prophets or Dreamers</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to have received divine revelations, often through signs or wonders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the warning against false prophets and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land the Israelites are about to enter, where they will encounter various religious practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous events or predictions that may be used to validate a prophet's message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_is_essential.htm">Discernment is Essential</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment and not be swayed by signs and wonders alone.
