The mountain is located in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho. It holds significant geographical importance as it provides a panoramic view of the Promised Land, which Moses was allowed to see but not enter. This ascent symbolizes Moses' final journey and the culmination of his leadership over Israel. The act of climbing the mountain can be seen as a metaphor for Moses' spiritual journey and obedience to God's command.<p><b>you will die and be gathered to your people</b><br>The phrase "gathered to your people" is a common biblical expression indicating death and joining one's ancestors in the afterlife. It reflects the belief in an existence beyond death and a reunion with forebears. This concept is consistent with the patriarchal narratives, where figures like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were also "gathered to their people." It underscores the continuity of God's covenant with His people beyond physical death.<p><b>just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor</b><br>Aaron's death on Mount Hor is recorded in <a href="/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22-29</a>. Like Moses, Aaron was not permitted to enter the Promised Land due to disobedience. His death on a mountain signifies a parallel between the two brothers, both leaders of Israel who faced the consequences of their actions. Mount Hor is traditionally identified with a peak in the Edomite range, emphasizing the wilderness journey of the Israelites.<p><b>and was gathered to his people</b><br>This reiterates the earlier phrase, emphasizing the common destiny of Moses and Aaron. It highlights the theme of divine justice and mercy, as both leaders are honored in death despite their failures. The repetition of this phrase reinforces the hope of an afterlife and the continuation of God's promises to His chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites who is being instructed by God regarding his impending death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who previously died on Mount Hor, serving as a parallel to Moses' own forthcoming death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_nebo.htm">Mount Nebo</a></b><br>The mountain Moses is instructed to climb, where he will die and be gathered to his people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_hor.htm">Mount Hor</a></b><br>The mountain where Aaron died, mentioned as a point of reference for Moses' death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people Moses has led out of Egypt and through the wilderness, who are on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_mortality.htm">The Certainty of Mortality</a></b><br>Moses' impending death serves as a reminder of the inevitability of death for all people.

I believe a clue to the reason may be found in the words and act which constituted their transgression. They were bidden to speak to the rock in Kadesh, and they struck it. The words which Moses used on that occasion were, "Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water <span class= "ital">out of this cliff </span>(<span class= "ital">Selagh</span>)<span class= "ital">?</span>" The last words of the sentence are emphatic; and the rock is described as a <span class= "ital">cliff, </span>not by the name given to the Rock in Horeb (<span class= "ital">Tz-r</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The emphasis laid upon these words has been much discussed by Jewish commentators, though it escapes English readers. I suspect that the mistake Moses and Aaron made, in thinking it needful to <span class= "ital">strike </span>the cliff, also led them to think it necessary to <span class= "ital">ascend it, </span>instead of gathering the congregation together beneath it, and speaking to it from below. This view harmonises with the spiritual significance of the act. The smitten Rock in Horeb was Christ; the Cliff not to be smitten in Kadesh pointed also to Christ, ascended now, needing only the prayer of faith to call down all that He will give. And so Moses himself taught, in some of his latest words. "It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say, <span class= "ital">Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us? </span>. . . <span class= "ital">But the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth."</span><p>The impatient words of Moses, after toiling up the cliff with his brother Aaron, had to be recompensed by their ascending mount Hor and mount Nebo to die. Moses, as the more responsible of the two, had to ascend on each occasion, for his brother's death and for his own. The remembrance of his brother's death in the Lord may well have comforted Moses in the prospect of his own.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be thou gathered unto thy people.</span> "To Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
