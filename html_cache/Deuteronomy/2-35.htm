It reflects the common practice in ancient warfare where the victors would take spoils from the defeated. This action was not only a means of survival but also a fulfillment of God's promise to provide for His people. The Israelites were acting under divine instruction, as God had given them the land and its resources.<p><b>only the livestock</b><br>Livestock was a valuable asset in ancient times, serving as a source of food, labor, and wealth. The emphasis on "only the livestock" suggests a restraint in their plundering, possibly indicating obedience to God's specific commands regarding what they could take. This restraint can be seen as a test of faith and obedience, as God had previously instructed them on what to do with the spoils of war (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-14.htm">Deuteronomy 20:14</a>).<p><b>and the plunder from the cities</b><br>The term "plunder" refers to goods taken by force, which in this context includes items of value such as metals, clothing, and other resources. The taking of plunder was a common practice in ancient warfare and was often seen as a reward for the victors. This action also served to weaken the enemy and strengthen the Israelites, both materially and psychologically.<p><b>we captured</b><br>The phrase "we captured" highlights the active role of the Israelites in the conquest of the land. It underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to give them victory over their enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-25</a>). This victory was not just a military achievement but a divine intervention, as God was leading and empowering them to take possession of the land He had promised to their ancestors. The capture of these cities also foreshadows the future conquests in the Promised Land, demonstrating God's faithfulness to His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, who are journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting their journey and God's commands to them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_heshbon.htm">Sihon, King of Heshbon</a></b><br>The Amorite king whose land was conquered by the Israelites as they journeyed to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>The city and region ruled by King Sihon, which was taken by the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of 40 years during which the Israelites wandered in the desert before entering the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Provision and Faithfulness</a></b><br>The Israelites' victory and acquisition of plunder demonstrate God's faithfulness in providing for His people.
