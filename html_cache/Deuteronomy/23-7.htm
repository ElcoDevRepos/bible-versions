This familial connection is the basis for the command not to despise them. Despite historical conflicts between Israel and Edom, such as Edom's refusal to allow Israel passage during the Exodus (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>), the Israelites are reminded of their shared ancestry. This reflects a broader biblical theme of reconciliation and forgiveness, as seen in the eventual reconciliation between Jacob and Esau in <a href="/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a>. The command also underscores the importance of kinship and the recognition of shared humanity, which is a recurring theme in the Bible.<p><b>Do not despise an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land.</b><br>The Israelites' time in Egypt, though marked by eventual enslavement, began with Joseph's rise to power and the subsequent settlement of his family in Goshen (<a href="/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11</a>). This period of residence, which lasted over 400 years, is acknowledged here as a time when Egypt provided refuge during a famine. The command to not despise Egyptians highlights the importance of gratitude and the recognition of past hospitality, even amidst later oppression. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches love for enemies and prayer for those who persecute (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). The instruction also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty in using nations and circumstances for His purposes, as seen in the eventual Exodus and the formation of Israel as a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>Descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother.
