Unlike other tribes, they did not receive a specific territorial inheritance but were given towns scattered throughout Israel (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). This arrangement allowed them to minister to the people across the nation. The movement of a Levite from one town to another signifies the flexibility in their service, emphasizing their role as servants of God rather than being tied to a specific location. This reflects the broader biblical theme of being called to serve God wherever He leads, as seen in the New Testament with the apostles and early church missionaries.<p><b>and comes in all earnestness</b><br>The phrase "in all earnestness" suggests a sincere and wholehearted devotion to serving God. This reflects the importance of intention and heart posture in worship and service, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). The Levite's earnestness underscores the necessity of genuine commitment in religious duties, contrasting with mere ritualistic observance. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament emphasis on worshiping "in spirit and truth" (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><b>to the place the LORD will choose</b><br>This refers to the central place of worship that God would designate, which ultimately became Jerusalem with the establishment of the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). Initially, the tabernacle served as the central place of worship, moving with the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The concept of a chosen place underscores God's sovereignty and the importance of centralized worship, which was intended to unify the nation in their devotion to Him. This foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the ultimate temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where believers gather in His name, transcending geographical limitations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle and later the temple.

There was as yet no provision made by which all could serve in turn at the tabernacle. When David divided them all into courses, priests, Levites, singers (and porters?) alike, there was no longer any need for this provision. The institutions of David prove its antiquity. The only case in history that illustrates it is that of the child Samuel. His father, Elkanah, was a descendant of Korah. He dwelt in Mount Ephraim, and came up to Shiloh year by year. But Samuel was dedicated by his mother to perpetual service there, and as long as the tabernacle continued in Shiloh, the child Samuel "ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest"--not as a priest, but as a Levite in attendance upon the priests.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - Only a portion of the Levites were engaged in the service of the sanctuary; the rest lived in their towns throughout the country.
