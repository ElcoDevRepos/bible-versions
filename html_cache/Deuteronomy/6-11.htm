The houses being "full of every good thing" signifies the completeness and sufficiency of God's blessings. Historically, this reflects the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settling in a land already developed by previous inhabitants, the Canaanites. Theologically, it underscores God's grace, as the Israelites receive blessings they did not earn, paralleling the concept of grace in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual blessings and fullness to believers (<a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>).<p><b>with wells that you did not dig,</b><br>Wells were crucial for survival in the arid climate of the Near East, representing life and sustenance. The mention of wells "that you did not dig" emphasizes the unearned nature of God's provision. In biblical context, wells often symbolize spiritual nourishment and life (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). This phrase also connects to the patriarchs, such as Isaac, who dug wells in the land (<a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18-22</a>), showing continuity in God's provision across generations.<p><b>and with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant&#8212;</b><br>Vineyards and olive groves were symbols of prosperity and stability in ancient Israel. They required years to cultivate, indicating long-term settlement and blessing. The Israelites inheriting these without laboring for them highlights God's promise and faithfulness. Vineyards are often used in Scripture as metaphors for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) and the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>). Olive oil was essential for daily life, used in cooking, lighting, and anointing, symbolizing the Holy Spirit in the New Testament (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><b>and when you eat and are satisfied,</b><br>This phrase points to the fulfillment and contentment found in God's provision. Eating and being satisfied is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing both physical and spiritual fulfillment (<a href="/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's ability to meet all needs, foreshadowing the spiritual satisfaction found in Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The satisfaction also calls for a response of gratitude and obedience, as seen in the surrounding context of Deuteronomy, where the Israelites are urged to remember and follow God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments and instructions to the people before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who are about to enter the Promised Land after their exodus from Egypt and years of wandering in the desert.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants, described as a land flowing with milk and honey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The region that the Israelites are about to enter, which is already inhabited by other nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The event of God providing for the Israelites by giving them cities, houses, and resources they did not labor for, as a fulfillment of His promise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God fulfills His promises, providing abundantly for His people beyond their efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_and_humility.htm">Gratitude and Humility</a></b><br>Recognize and be thankful for the blessings and provisions that come from God, acknowledging that they are not earned by our own merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship.htm">Stewardship</a></b><br>With great blessings come responsibilities.

Israel&#8217;s role is to enter and obey; the Lord&#8217;s role is to provide (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows the gospel pattern: believers inherit spiritual riches we did not earn (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Warning: material plenty can dull spiritual vigilance. Moses will shortly caution, &#8220;then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wells that you did not dig</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;with wells that you did not dig&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>b)<p>&#8226; Wells represent life in an arid land. Digging one was labor-intensive and uncertain; finding water symbolized survival (<a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18-22</a>).<p>&#8226; God removes the toil and risk: Israel drinks freely from sources prepared in advance (<a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>). The lesson: every daily necessity flows from Him (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross-reference to Jesus&#8217; promise of &#8220;living water&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>). Just as Israel&#8217;s wells were a gift, so eternal life is a gift, not human achievement.<p>&#8226; Practical application: gratitude should shape ordinary routines&#8212;drawing water, cooking meals, earning income&#8212;because each provision ultimately traces back to the Lord (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant&#8212;and when you eat and are satisfied</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant&#8212;and when you eat and are satisfied&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>c)<p>&#8226; Vineyards and olive trees take years to mature; Israel would harvest immediately. This highlights God&#8217;s timing: He blesses before we can contribute (<a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Eating &#8220;and are satisfied&#8221; recalls the covenant aim: a land &#8220;flowing with milk and honey&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Satisfaction is legitimate; forgetfulness is deadly. Hence the next verse: &#8220;be careful that you do not forget the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, vines and olives symbolize joy and anointing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1-2</a>). God invites His people to rejoice responsibly, stewarding gifts for His glory (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant echo: believers partake of the true vine, Christ (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-5</a>). Our fruitfulness, like Israel&#8217;s harvest, depends entirely on abiding in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a> reminds God&#8217;s people that every facet of abundance&#8212;homes, water, food&#8212;comes from His sovereign generosity, not from human effort. The verse calls us to gratitude, humble dependence, and vigilant remembrance, so that prosperity never replaces devotion but instead fuels heartfelt obedience and worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">with houses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1448;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;t&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
