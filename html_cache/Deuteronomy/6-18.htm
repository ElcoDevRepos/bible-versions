The concept of doing what is "right and good" is rooted in the moral and ethical standards set by God, as seen in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). It underscores the idea that true righteousness is defined by God's standards, not human judgment. This call to obedience is echoed in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which highlights doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God.<p><b>so that it may be well with you</b><br>This part of the verse promises blessings and well-being as a result of obedience. The principle of reaping the benefits of following God's laws is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). It reflects the covenantal promise that obedience leads to life and prosperity, while disobedience leads to curses and hardship (Deuteronomy 28). This concept is also seen in the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>, which links adherence to God's commandments with a long and peaceful life.<p><b>and that you may enter and possess the good land</b><br>The "good land" refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God pledged to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This promise is central to the narrative of the Pentateuch, beginning with God's covenant with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>. The land is described as "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), symbolizing abundance and divine provision. The historical context involves the Israelites' journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom and settlement in Canaan, a fulfillment of God's promise.<p><b>that the LORD your God swore to give your fathers</b><br>This phrase highlights the faithfulness of God in keeping His promises. The patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;received God's promise of land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The swearing of an oath by God underscores the certainty and unchangeable nature of His promises (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>). This assurance of God's faithfulness is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, providing hope and encouragement to believers that God will fulfill His promises in His perfect timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who has promised the land to the forefathers of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God swore to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_forefathers.htm">The Forefathers</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom God made the promise of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God&#8217;s Commands</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the importance of doing what is right and good in God's sight, which requires understanding and following His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/blessings_of_obedience.htm">Blessings of Obedience</a></b><br>The promise of well-being and possession of the land is tied to obedience, illustrating the principle that God rewards those who follow His ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>The reference to the land promised to the forefathers highlights God's faithfulness to His covenant, encouraging believers to trust in His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_and_ethical_living.htm">Moral and Ethical Living</a></b><br>The call to do what is right and good extends beyond ritualistic observance to encompass moral and ethical living, reflecting God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_a_witness.htm">Living as a Witness</a></b><br>By living according to God's standards, believers serve as a testimony to others, drawing them to the truth of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_6_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 6:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_act_rightly_and_well_daily.htm">How can we "do what is right and good" in daily life today?
