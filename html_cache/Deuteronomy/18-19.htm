In the context of Deuteronomy, God is establishing His covenant with Israel and setting forth laws and guidelines for the nation. Accountability here implies a divine judgment, where God Himself will ensure that His commands are followed. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the moral responsibility of His people.<p><b>anyone who does not listen</b><br>Listening in the biblical sense often implies obedience and heeding God's commands. In ancient Israel, listening was not merely auditory but involved a response of faith and action. This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's word, a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which calls believers to be doers of the word, not hearers only.<p><b>to My words</b><br>The words referred to here are those spoken by God through His prophets. In the Old Testament, prophets were God's mouthpieces, delivering His messages to the people. This highlights the divine origin of the prophetic message and the expectation that it be received with the same authority as if God Himself were speaking directly.<p><b>that the prophet speaks</b><br>Prophets in Israel were chosen by God to convey His messages. This phrase indicates the role of the prophet as an intermediary between God and the people. Prophets like Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah played crucial roles in guiding Israel according to God's will. The prophetic office is a precursor to the ultimate prophet, Jesus Christ, who perfectly reveals God's will.<p><b>in My name</b><br>Speaking in God's name signifies that the prophet's message carries divine authority. In biblical times, a name represented one's character and authority. Thus, a prophet speaking in God's name was delivering a message that was not his own but was sanctioned by God. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks and acts in the name of the Father, affirming His divine mission and authority (<a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>A spokesperson for God, who delivers His words to the people.
