This phrase sets the stage for a divinely sanctioned military campaign. The Israelites were often in conflict with surrounding nations, such as the Canaanites, Philistines, and others who occupied the Promised Land. The concept of "holy war" is significant here, as these battles were not merely political but were seen as fulfilling God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Israelites were to rely on God's guidance and strength rather than their own military prowess.<p><b>and the LORD your God delivers them into your hand</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the belief that victory in battle is granted by God, not achieved solely through human effort. It reflects the theological perspective that God is sovereign over all nations and that He actively intervenes in the affairs of His chosen people. This divine intervention is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in battles such as those at Jericho (Joshua 6) and against the Midianites (Judges 7). The phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's commands results in His favor and assistance.<p><b>and you take them captive</b><br>Taking captives was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving both as a means of subjugating defeated peoples and as a way to integrate them into the victor's society. In the context of Deuteronomy, this action is regulated by specific laws that aim to ensure humane treatment of captives, particularly women, as seen in the verses that follow (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11-14</a>). This reflects a broader biblical principle of justice and mercy, even towards enemies. The treatment of captives can also be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He takes "captive" those who were once enemies of God and integrates them into His kingdom (<a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_soldiers.htm">Israelite Soldiers</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/deuteronomy/21-10.htm">Deuteronomy 21:10</a> involves Israelite soldiers who are returning from battle. These soldiers are part of God's chosen people, tasked with following His commandments even in times of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_nations.htm">Foreign Nations</a></b><br>The verse implies a context of warfare with foreign nations. These nations are those that the Israelites encounter as they enter the Promised Land, often representing pagan cultures and practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/captive_woman.htm">Captive Woman</a></b><br>The verse introduces the concept of a captive woman taken during warfare. This woman is from the defeated foreign nations and becomes a subject of specific laws regarding her treatment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_human_dignity.htm">Respect for Human Dignity</a></b><br>The laws in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-10.htm">Deuteronomy 21:10</a> and following emphasize the importance of treating captives with dignity and respect, reflecting God's concern for all human beings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_warfare.htm">God's Sovereignty in Warfare</a></b><br>The context of this verse reminds us that God is sovereign over nations and battles.

But it may well apply to the recent case of the Midianitish maidens (<a href="/context/numbers/31-15.htm" title="And Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?">Numbers 31:15-18</a>), who had been taken captive in great numbers, and would naturally be reduced to slavery. It is clear from this passage that they could not be treated as concubines.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Shall shave her head, and pare her nails.</span>--Rashi's view is that the object of this order is to spoil the beauty of the captive. The long hair is to be cut off, and the nails pared. On this last point the Targums differ; one taking the view that they are to be left to grow and the other the opposite interpretation. In <a href="/2_samuel/19-24.htm" title="And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.">2Samuel 19:24</a>, there are two examples of the use of the word in the sense of attending to the person. The correct interpretation in this place depends upon the purpose for which the thing was to be done. If the intention was any kind of purification, and long or taper nails were considered an ornament (as by some Eastern nations), it is more probable that the nails were to be cut short.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">The raiment of her captivity.</span>--Rashi takes this to mean the beautiful raiment put on for the purpose of attracting her captors. (Compare Jezebel's attempt to captivate Jehu, <a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm" title="And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.">2Kings 9:30</a>.) Whatever may be the precise intent of these several instructions, it is clear that the law is intended to encourage lawful marriage, and no other form of union. In this view it throws an important light upon the treatment of the Midianitish captives in Numbers 31 . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - If an Israelite saw among captives taken in war a woman, fair of aspect, and loved her, and took her to be his wife, he was to allow her a full month to mourn her lost kindred, and become accustomed to her new condition, before he consummated his union with her. This refers to captives from other nations than those of Canaan, with whom the Israelites were to form no alliance, and whom they were not to take captive, but either wholly destroy or render tributary (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>;
