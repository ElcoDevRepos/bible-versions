The "him" refers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, whose defeat was crucial for Israel's journey to the Promised Land. This act of God delivering enemies into the hands of His people is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating God's faithfulness to His covenant promises. It echoes the assurance given in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>, where God promises to fight for Israel. This divine deliverance prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>and we defeated him and his sons and his whole army</b><br>The defeat of Sihon and his forces signifies a complete victory granted by God. This victory was not just over Sihon himself but extended to his sons and entire army, indicating the totality of the conquest. Historically, this event marked a significant turning point for the Israelites, as it opened the way for further conquests in the Transjordan region. The comprehensive nature of the victory is reminiscent of other biblical battles where God grants His people triumph over seemingly insurmountable odds, such as the battle of Jericho (Joshua 6). This phrase also underscores the importance of obedience and reliance on God for success, a principle that is echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who actively participates in the deliverance and victories of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by Moses, journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The Amorite king of Heshbon, who opposed Israel and was defeated by them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>The capital city of King Sihon, representing the Amorite kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The event where God delivered Sihon and his army into the hands of the Israelites, marking a significant victory in their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battle.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battle</a></b><br>The victory over Sihon underscores God's control over nations and leaders.

Israel did not chalk up the win to superior tactics; rather, God actively &#8220;delivered&#8221; Sihon into their hands (see <a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s faithfulness keeps His covenant promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and reassures the people that every step into the promised land comes under divine oversight.<p>&#8211; Notice the personal pronoun &#8220;our&#8221;: this is the God who has entered relationship with His people (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p>&#8211; When God delivers, the outcome is settled before the battle begins&#8212;an encouraging truth for believers facing spiritual opposition today (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and we defeated him and his sons</b><p>&#8211; Human responsibility follows divine initiative.
