It highlights the historical context of the conquest under Moses' leadership, emphasizing God's timing and sovereignty in delivering victories to His people.<p><b>we took from the two kings of the Amorites</b><br>The two kings mentioned are Sihon and Og, rulers of the Amorite territories east of the Jordan River. This conquest is significant as it demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Israel. The defeat of these kings is also a precursor to the larger conquest of Canaan, showcasing God's provision and the Israelites' obedience.<p><b>the land across the Jordan</b><br>This land refers to the Transjordan region, which includes territories that would later be allocated to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The phrase underscores the geographical expansion of Israel's territory and God's promise to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.<p><b>from the Arnon Valley</b><br>The Arnon Valley served as a natural boundary between Moab and the Amorite kingdom. It is a significant geographical marker in the biblical narrative, representing the southern limit of the land conquered by Israel. This valley is mentioned in other biblical texts, highlighting its importance in the region's topography.<p><b>as far as Mount Hermon</b><br>Mount Hermon marks the northern boundary of the conquered territory. It is a prominent mountain range known for its height and snow-capped peaks. In biblical literature, Mount Hermon is often associated with fertility and abundance, symbolizing the richness of the land God provided to Israel. The mention of Mount Hermon also connects to other scriptural references, such as <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>, which speaks of the unity and blessing associated with this region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who recounts the victories over the Amorite kings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of people living in the land east of the Jordan River, known for their opposition to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon_valley.htm">Arnon Valley</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary marking the southern extent of the land taken from the Amorites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_hermon.htm">Mount Hermon</a></b><br>A prominent mountain marking the northern boundary of the conquered territory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_kings_of_the_amorites.htm">Two Kings of the Amorites</a></b><br>Refers to King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, whose lands were conquered by the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_fulfillment_of_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness in Fulfillment of Promises</a></b><br>The conquest of the Amorite lands demonstrates God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to the Israelites.

Hermon is the southernmost spur of the Autilibanus range. It is "the second mountain in Syria, ranking next to the highest peak of Lebanon behind the cedars. The elevation of Hermon may be estimated at about 10,000 feet. The whole body of the mountain is limestone, similar to that which composes the main ridge of Lebanon, the central peak rises up an obtuse truncated cone, from 2000 to 3000 feet above the ridges that radiate from it, thus giving it a more commanding aspect than any other mountain in Syria. This cone is entirely naked, destitute alike of trees and vegetation. The snow never disappears from its summit" (Porter, 'Handbook, Syria and Palestine,' p. 431). At the present day it is known as <span class="accented">Jebel esh-Sheikh</span> (The Chief Mountain), also <span class="accented">Jebel eth Thel</span> (The Snow Mountain). Anciently also it had various names. By the Hebrews it was known also as <span class="accented">Sion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>, the high, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>); by the Sidonians it was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> = <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, a cuirass or coat of mail), probably from its shining appearance, especially when covered with snow and by the Amorites it was called <span class="accented">Senir</span>, a word probably of the same meaning.
