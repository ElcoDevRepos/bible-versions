His unique role as a mediator between God and the Israelites is unparalleled. This phrase highlights the singularity of Moses' prophetic ministry, which included direct communication with God (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>) and the delivery of the Law. The expectation of a prophet like Moses is later fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> and <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>.<p><b>who performed all the mighty acts of power</b><br>Moses' ministry was marked by extraordinary miracles, such as the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna. These acts demonstrated God's power and validated Moses' leadership. The miracles served as signs to both the Israelites and the Egyptians, affirming God's sovereignty and Moses' divine commission. The New Testament draws parallels between Moses' miracles and those of Jesus, who performed signs and wonders to reveal His divine authority (<a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>).<p><b>and awesome deeds</b><br>The term "awesome deeds" refers to the awe-inspiring events that accompanied Moses' leadership, including the giving of the Ten Commandments and the establishment of the covenant at Mount Sinai. These deeds were not only miraculous but also foundational for the identity and faith of Israel. They underscore the holiness and majesty of God, who chose Israel as His people. The awe associated with Moses' deeds is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus' works inspire reverence and faith (<a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>).<p><b>that Moses did in the sight of all Israel</b><br>Moses' actions were witnessed by the entire nation, ensuring that his leadership and God's power were undeniable to the people. This public nature of his deeds reinforced the communal aspect of Israel's faith and covenant relationship with God. The visibility of Moses' acts parallels the public ministry of Jesus, whose miracles and teachings were witnessed by many, establishing His authority and fulfilling the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Moses is the prophet and leader of Israel who led the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Scripture records &#8220;Since that time, no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>). Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we accept this as a historical fact: every prophet who followed&#8212;Joshua, Samuel, Elijah, Isaiah&#8212;was significant, yet none matched Moses&#8217; stature. Cross references such as <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a> show the LORD elevating Moses above all others, speaking with him &#8220;face to face.&#8221; The verse therefore opens by stressing a total absence of any rival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who performed</b><p>The Spirit points to actions, not merely words. Prophets proclaim, but Moses both proclaimed and acted. <a href="/exodus/4-17.htm">Exodus 4:17</a> captures the pattern: &#8220;Take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs.&#8221; His ministry was tangible, confirming divine revelation with visible proof. By highlighting performance, the text draws us to look at God&#8217;s power displayed through human obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the mighty acts of power</b><p>Consider the scale:<p>&#8226; Ten plagues that dismantled Egypt&#8217;s gods (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The Red Sea split, creating dry ground (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Water gushed from the rock&#8212;twice (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Manna fell daily for forty years (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>).<p>These &#8220;mighty acts&#8221; are not exaggerations; they literally happened. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2-7</a> urges Israel to remember &#8220;His greatness, His mighty hand and outstretched arm.&#8221; Every miracle demonstrated that Israel&#8217;s God alone is omnipotent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and awesome deeds</b><p>&#8220;Awe&#8221; here carries the weight of holy fear and wonder. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> reminds Israel, &#8220;He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome wonders your eyes have seen.&#8221; The burning bush, Sinai&#8217;s thunder, the quaking mountain (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>)&#8212;all left the nation trembling. These deeds moved hearts toward worship and underscored God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Moses did</b><p>Although God empowered every sign, Moses&#8217; obedient cooperation mattered. <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a> confirms, &#8220;Moses was faithful as a servant in all God&#8217;s house.&#8221; His willingness to stretch out the rod, speak to Pharaoh, or raise his hands over the sea became the human channel for divine power. The credit goes to the LORD, yet the verse honors Moses&#8217; unique role in history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sight of all Israel</b><p>Nothing happened in a corner. The entire nation&#8212;men, women, and children&#8212;saw the plagues&#8217; effects, walked between ocean walls, gathered manna, and heard the Law proclaimed. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34-35</a> insists that these public miracles proved &#8220;you were shown these things so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him.&#8221; Corporate eyewitness testimony cements the reliability of the record and obligates subsequent generations to trust and obey.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/34-12.htm">Deuteronomy 34:12</a> crowns the Pentateuch by affirming Moses&#8217; unmatched prophetic ministry. No other prophet combined intimate fellowship with God, dramatic miracles, and public credibility in the same measure. Every mighty act and awesome deed literally occurred, displaying God&#8217;s power and confirming His covenant before the eyes of an entire nation. The verse invites us to remember, revere, and respond in faith, knowing the God who acted through Moses is still sovereign and trustworthy today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/34-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and in all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
