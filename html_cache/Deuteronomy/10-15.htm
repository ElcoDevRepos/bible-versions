This divine affection is rooted in the covenant God made with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), which promised blessings and a multitude of descendants. The love mentioned here is not based on the merit of the patriarchs but on God's gracious will. This reflects the biblical theme of God's electing love, seen also in <a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>, where Paul discusses God's choice of Jacob over Esau. The phrase underscores the personal and relational nature of God's covenant, emphasizing His faithfulness and commitment to His promises.<p><b>And He has chosen you, their descendants after them,</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the continuity of God's covenantal promises from the patriarchs to their descendants, the nation of Israel. The concept of being "chosen" is central to Israel's identity and mission, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where Israel is called a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation." This choice is not based on Israel's size or strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>) but on God's love and the oath He swore to their forefathers. Theologically, this prefigures the New Testament understanding of the church as the chosen people of God (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), extending the idea of election to all who are in Christ.<p><b>above all the peoples,</b><br>This phrase indicates the unique status of Israel among the nations. Israel's election was not for privilege alone but for a purpose&#8212;to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). This special status is tied to their role in God's redemptive plan, ultimately leading to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who would bring salvation to all peoples (<a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>). The phrase also reflects the historical context of the ancient Near East, where nations often had their own deities, but Israel was distinct in worshiping the one true God.<p><b>even to this day.</b><br>This emphasizes the enduring nature of God's covenant and faithfulness. Despite Israel's repeated disobedience and the challenges they faced, God's promises remained steadfast. This phrase reassures the Israelites of God's unchanging commitment, which is a recurring theme throughout Deuteronomy. It also points forward to the New Covenant, where God's faithfulness is fully realized in Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). The continuity "to this day" serves as a reminder of God's eternal purposes and the assurance that His promises are reliable and everlasting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His sovereign choice and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/your_fathers.htm">Your Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarchs of Israel, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with whom God established His covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of the patriarchs, chosen by God to be His special people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations (Peoples)</a></b><br>The other nations of the world, contrasted with Israel as God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who delivers God's message to the Israelites in the book of Deuteronomy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God's selection of Israel was based on His love and promise, not on their merit.
