This reflects the communal nature of society, where disputes were resolved publicly. The role of elders is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>, where Boaz addresses the elders at the city gate. The involvement of elders underscores the importance of maintaining justice and order according to God's law.<p><b>I gave my daughter in marriage to this man</b><br>Marriage in ancient Israel was a covenantal relationship, often arranged by the parents, reflecting the patriarchal structure of society. The giving of a daughter in marriage was a significant familial and social event, symbolizing the transfer of responsibility and protection from the father to the husband. This practice is evident in <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>, where Abraham's servant seeks a wife for Isaac, highlighting the importance of family alliances and continuity of lineage.<p><b>but he has come to hate her</b><br>This phrase indicates a breach of the marital covenant, which was meant to be a lifelong commitment. Hatred in this context suggests a severe relational breakdown, possibly involving false accusations or mistreatment. The Mosaic Law provided protections for women in such situations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, where regulations for divorce are outlined. This reflects God's concern for justice and the protection of the vulnerable within the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_woman's_father.htm">The Young Woman's Father</a></b><br>Represents the authority and protector of the daughter in ancient Israelite society.
