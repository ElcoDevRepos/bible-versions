The term "abominations" is often used in the Old Testament to describe practices that are detestable to God, especially idolatry. The Israelites were repeatedly warned against adopting these practices (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The presence of idols among the nations served as a test of Israel's faithfulness to Yahweh, highlighting the constant temptation to turn away from the covenant. This warning is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are cautioned against idolatry in any form (1 <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>).<p><b>made of wood and stone, of silver and gold</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the material nature of the idols, contrasting the lifelessness of these objects with the living God of Israel. Wood and stone were common materials for idol-making in ancient times, often overlaid with precious metals like silver and gold to enhance their appearance and perceived value. Despite their ornate construction, these idols were powerless and unable to save or deliver (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The use of valuable materials also reflects the economic and cultural investment in idol worship, which was deeply ingrained in the societies surrounding Israel. This serves as a reminder of the futility of trusting in material wealth or human creations, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering the message from God.
