The context is a covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to blessings and disobedience results in curses. Lending and borrowing were significant in ancient Israelite society, reflecting economic stability and power. The ability to lend indicates prosperity and dominance, while the inability to lend signifies subjugation and dependency. This curse contrasts with the blessing in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>, where Israel is promised to lend to many nations and not borrow. The reversal of roles here serves as a warning of the loss of God's favor and the resulting economic and social decline. This principle is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>, which states, "The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender," emphasizing the power dynamics involved in lending and borrowing.<p><b>He will be the head, and you will be the tail.</b><br>This phrase uses the metaphor of the head and tail to illustrate leadership and subordination. In biblical symbolism, the head represents authority, leadership, and decision-making, while the tail signifies a lack of control and subservience. This imagery is used to convey the consequences of Israel's disobedience, where they would become subservient to other nations rather than leading them. The head and tail metaphor is also found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>, where obedience results in Israel being the head and not the tail, highlighting the stark contrast between the outcomes of obedience and disobedience. Historically, Israel experienced periods of subjugation under foreign powers, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians, which can be seen as fulfillments of this curse. Theologically, this phrase underscores the importance of covenant faithfulness and the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and blessings/curses to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the covenant and its stipulations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, contingent on their obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, including blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_nations.htm">Foreign Nations</a></b><br>Represent those who will dominate Israel if they fail to obey God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_consequences.htm">Obedience and Consequences</a></b><br>The verse highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands.

The phrase pictures Israel slipping from lender to borrower&#8212;exactly opposite of the blessing in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-6.htm">Deuteronomy 15:6 and 28</a>:12, where obedience would make them the ones who &#8220;will lend to many nations but will borrow from none&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Borrowing here signals loss of God-given prosperity. <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a> reminds, &#8220;The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender&#8221;. Becoming dependent on outside money exposes the spiritual root: they have abandoned the Giver.<p>&#8226; Throughout Israel&#8217;s history, whenever the people turned from the Lord, foreign powers like the Midianites (<a href="/bsb/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>) or Assyrians (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>) drained their resources. Debt, then, is more than economics; it is a barometer of covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you will not lend to him</b><p>&#8226; The total reversal is unmistakable. Once God had promised influence and generosity; now that witness disappears. <a href="/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3&#8211;5</a> shows returning exiles forced to mortgage fields and even children because of famine and tax&#8212;an illustration of this curse playing out.<p>&#8226; Without surplus, Israel could no longer extend mercy loans commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-8.htm">Deuteronomy 15:8</a>. Their inability to give reflects spiritual bankruptcy as much as financial.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a> warns that &#8220;your strength will be spent in vain&#8221; when the Lord&#8217;s favor is withdrawn. Economic impotence signals a deeper power loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will be the head</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Head&#8221; denotes leadership and control. In blessing, God intended Israel to occupy that position (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>). Under judgment, foreign nations seize it.<p>&#8226; Historical snapshots: Pharaoh Necho sets up his own choice of king in Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1&#8211;4</a>); Nebuchadnezzar installs Zedekiah (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Outsiders dictate terms because covenant rebels surrendered the helm.<p>&#8226; The principle endures: when God&#8217;s people refuse His rule, He allows others to rule them. <a href="/isaiah/3-4.htm">Isaiah 3:4&#8211;5</a> records a similar consequence: immature or oppressive leaders rise when the Lord is rejected.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will be the tail</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Tail&#8221; pictures subservience, insignificance, and vulnerability. Instead of guiding history, Israel is dragged along by it. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-43.htm">Deuteronomy 28:43</a> describes foreigners rising &#8220;higher and higher,&#8221; while Israel sinks &#8220;lower and lower.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a> captures the tail position: &#8220;How lonely lies the city, once so full of people! She has become like a widow.&#8221; The once-influential nation becomes an afterthought.<p>&#8226; Being the tail also means carrying the weight of others&#8217; decisions&#8212;taxes, tribute, forced labor&#8212;seen under Solomon&#8217;s successors (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Disobedience steals the dignity God designed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Deuteronomy 28:44</a> paints the tragic flip side of God&#8217;s covenant: disobedience turns lenders into borrowers, leaders into followers. The verse warns that rejecting the Lord drains prosperity, influence, and honor, leaving His people dependent and dominated. Faithful obedience, by contrast, keeps God&#8217;s people at the head, able to bless others rather than beg from them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will lend to you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(yal&#183;w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
