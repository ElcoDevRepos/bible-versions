In the context of <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, "this" refers to the idolatry and rebellion of the Israelites. God's ability to see and know all things is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where David acknowledges God's intimate knowledge of human actions and thoughts. The Israelites' actions were not hidden from God, emphasizing His role as a just and righteous judge.<p><b>He rejected them</b><br>The rejection here signifies God's disapproval and the withdrawal of His favor. This is consistent with the covenantal relationship established in Deuteronomy, where blessings and curses are contingent upon Israel's obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The rejection is not permanent but serves as a disciplinary measure to bring the people back to repentance, similar to the warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>.<p><b>provoked to anger</b><br>God's anger is a response to sin and unfaithfulness. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, deities were often depicted as capricious, but the God of Israel's anger is always just and measured, rooted in His holiness and righteousness. This anger is not like human anger but is a divine response to covenant violation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a> during the golden calf incident.<p><b>by His sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial relationship between God and Israel, portraying the nation as His children. This imagery is used throughout the Old Testament to emphasize God's care and the expected loyalty of Israel (<a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>). The use of "sons and daughters" underscores the personal nature of the offense, as it is not just a breach of law but a betrayal of a familial bond. This familial language is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called children of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy, just, and righteous. He is the central figure in this verse, expressing His response to Israel's actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Sons and Daughters)</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, referred to as His "sons and daughters." They are the recipients of God's covenant and the ones who have provoked His anger through their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering this song as a witness against Israel for their future rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A prophetic song given by Moses in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, serving as a witness to Israel's future unfaithfulness and God's faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which Israel is about to enter. The context of this verse is a warning before they take possession of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_anger.htm">God's Righteous Anger</a></b><br>God's anger is a response to sin and unfaithfulness. It is not arbitrary but rooted in His holiness and justice. Understanding this helps us appreciate the seriousness of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Israel's identity as God's "sons and daughters" highlights the personal and covenantal nature of their relationship with God. Believers today are also in a covenant relationship with God through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Just as Israel faced consequences for their rebellion, believers are reminded that disobedience can lead to God's discipline. This is a call to live in obedience and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_despite_human_unfaithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness Despite Human Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>Even when provoked, God remains faithful to His promises. This encourages believers to trust in God's steadfast love and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_remembrance.htm">The Role of Remembrance</a></b><br>The Song of Moses serves as a reminder of past failures and God's faithfulness.
