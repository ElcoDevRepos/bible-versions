The two stone tablets symbolize the covenant between God and Israel, representing God's law and His expectations for His people. The giving of the tablets is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the formalization of their relationship with God. This event took place on Mount Sinai, a significant location in biblical history, where God revealed Himself to Moses and the Israelites.<p><b>inscribed by the finger of God</b><br>The phrase "inscribed by the finger of God" underscores the divine authority and permanence of the commandments. This expression is unique and signifies that the law is not merely a human interpretation but a direct communication from God. The use of "finger of God" is also seen in <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a> and is a powerful image of God's direct involvement in the creation of the law. It suggests that the commandments are unchangeable and eternal, reflecting God's holy and perfect nature.<p><b>with the exact words that the LORD spoke to you</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the precision and faithfulness of God's communication. The commandments were not paraphrased or altered; they were given with exactness, ensuring that the Israelites received God's law as He intended. This highlights the importance of adhering to God's word without deviation. It also reflects the concept of divine revelation, where God communicates His will clearly and authoritatively to His people.<p><b>out of the fire on the mountain</b><br>The imagery of fire is significant, symbolizing God's presence, holiness, and power. The fire on the mountain represents God's glory and the awe-inspiring nature of His revelation. This event is described in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, where Mount Sinai is enveloped in smoke because the LORD descended on it in fire. The fire serves as a reminder of God's majesty and the seriousness of His covenant with Israel. It also prefigures the Holy Spirit's coming at Pentecost, where tongues of fire symbolize God's presence and empowerment.<p><b>on the day of the assembly</b><br>The "day of the assembly" refers to the gathering of the Israelites at Mount Sinai to receive God's law. This was a momentous occasion in Israel's history, where the entire nation witnessed God's revelation and entered into a covenant with Him. The assembly signifies the communal aspect of the covenant, where the people collectively agreed to follow God's commandments. This event is foundational for understanding Israel's identity as God's chosen people and their responsibility to live according to His law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the tablets of stone from God.
