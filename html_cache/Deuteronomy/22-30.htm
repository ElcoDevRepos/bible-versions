The prohibition against marrying a father's wife, which could include a stepmother, is rooted in the need to uphold family honor and prevent incestuous relationships. This law reflects the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where family lineage and inheritance were crucial. Similar prohibitions are found in <a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8 and 20</a>:11, underscoring the seriousness of this command. The New Testament also addresses similar issues of sexual immorality in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, where Paul rebukes the Corinthian church for tolerating a man who has taken his father's wife, indicating the continuity of this moral principle.<p><b>so that he will not dishonor his father&#8217;s marriage bed</b><br>The phrase "dishonor his father&#8217;s marriage bed" highlights the sanctity of marriage and the respect owed to one's parents. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the marriage bed symbolized the exclusive and sacred union between a husband and wife. Violating this union by marrying a father's wife would bring shame and dishonor not only to the father but to the entire family. This commandment serves to protect the integrity of the family unit and the social order. The concept of honoring one's parents is deeply embedded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and this specific law reinforces that principle by addressing a potential source of familial dishonor. The emphasis on honor and purity in family relationships can also be seen as a type pointing to the purity and faithfulness expected in the relationship between Christ and the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the laws, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are headed, known for its different cultural practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/father's_wife.htm">Father's Wife</a></b><br>Refers to a stepmother, highlighting the family dynamics and respect for parental relationships.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_bed.htm">Marriage Bed</a></b><br>Symbolizes the sanctity and exclusivity of the marital relationship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_boundaries.htm">Respect for Family Boundaries</a></b><br>The commandment underscores the importance of respecting family relationships and boundaries.

Scripture often begins moral directives with a clear prohibition before explaining why (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording assumes male agency and responsibility; a man is expected to guard family boundaries, echoing <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where marriage establishes a new, distinct household.<p>&#8226; The prohibition serves as a safeguard for the entire community, much as <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10&#8211;12</a> protects marriage vows from violation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;his father&#8217;s wife&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points to the father&#8217;s current or former wife&#8212;typically a stepmother&#8212;without mentioning whether the father is alive. <a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7&#8211;8</a> makes the same point, classifying such a union as &#8220;nakedness&#8221; that must not be uncovered.<p>&#8226; By including &#8220;father&#8217;s wife&#8221; instead of &#8220;mother,&#8221; the law covers blended families and polygamous situations sometimes present in ancient Israel (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>; 49:4).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a> shows that ignoring this boundary leads to scandal even among unbelievers, underscoring why the Torah established it early.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;so that he will not dishonor&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Dishonor&#8221; conveys both moral shame and legal guilt. Deuteronomy often frames commands with the consequences of disrespect (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Disgrace spreads beyond the individual, touching the father, the wife, and the wider covenant community (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a> later pronounces a curse on one who violates this rule, illustrating how God views such dishonor as covenant-breaking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;his father&#8217;s marriage bed.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;marriage bed&#8221; symbolizes the sanctity of the parents&#8217; union. <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a> echoes the principle: &#8220;Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept undefiled.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Violating this bed is more than sexual sin; it is an assault on the authority structure God set for the family (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Reuben&#8217;s sin with Bilhah (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>) shows the destructive fallout&#8212;loss of inheritance and leadership (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>). The law aims to prevent such rupture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a> says, &#8220;A man is not to marry his father&#8217;s wife, so that he will not dishonor his father&#8217;s marriage bed.&#8221; The verse protects family integrity, honors the father, and upholds the sanctity of marriage. It forbids a man from taking his stepmother as wife, guarding against shame that would fracture both household and community.
