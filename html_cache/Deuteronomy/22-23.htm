Betrothal was a formal agreement, often arranged by families, and breaking it required a formal divorce. This reflects the high value placed on marital fidelity and purity. The concept of betrothal is seen in the New Testament with Mary and Joseph (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18-19</a>), highlighting the continuity of this cultural practice.<p><b>and another man encounters her in the city</b><br>The setting of the city is significant because it implies a public space where help could be sought. Cities in ancient Israel were often walled and densely populated, suggesting that the woman had the opportunity to cry out for help if she was being assaulted. This context is crucial for understanding the legal and moral expectations of the time. The city setting contrasts with the countryside, where different rules applied due to isolation (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-25.htm">Deuteronomy 22:25-27</a>).<p><b>and sleeps with her</b><br>The phrase "sleeps with her" indicates a sexual encounter, which, in this context, is non-consensual due to the woman's betrothal status. The law in Deuteronomy addresses issues of consent, responsibility, and justice. This reflects the broader biblical theme of protecting the vulnerable and upholding justice, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16-17</a>. The act is considered a serious offense, not only against the woman but also against her betrothed and the community's moral fabric.

This command protects the sanctity of marriage and guards against exploitation.<p>- The penalty given in verse 24&#8212;death for both&#8212;shows how seriously the Lord views covenant violations, paralleling <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a> teaches that if an engaged virgin and a man willingly commit adultery within a public setting, both are fully accountable before God.
