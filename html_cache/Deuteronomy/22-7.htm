In the context of ancient Israel, this was a common activity for sustenance. The law here provides a guideline for ethical treatment of animals, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and compassion. This principle reflects God's care for all creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given dominion over the earth with the responsibility to steward it wisely.<p><b>but be sure to let the mother go</b><br>Letting the mother bird go ensures the continuation of the species, as the mother can reproduce again. This command reflects a broader biblical principle of mercy and compassion, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which states that a righteous person cares for the needs of their animals. It also aligns with the concept of not exploiting resources to the point of destruction, a theme echoed in <a href="/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4</a>, where the land is given a Sabbath rest.<p><b>so that it may be well with you</b><br>This phrase suggests a direct correlation between obedience to God's commands and well-being. It echoes the covenantal promise found throughout Deuteronomy, where obedience leads to blessings. This principle is reiterated in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>, which promises prosperity and longevity for those who follow God's ways. It underscores the belief that God's laws are designed for the benefit and flourishing of His people.<p><b>and that you may prolong your days</b><br>The promise of prolonged days is a common motif in Deuteronomy, often associated with obedience to God's commandments. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where adherence to the law results in life and blessing. It is reminiscent of the fifth commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, which promises long life for honoring one's parents. This connection highlights the broader biblical theme that obedience to God leads to life, a concept ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to those who follow Him (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the law, God's chosen people, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother_bird_and_young.htm">Mother Bird and Young</a></b><br>The specific subjects of the law, representing God's creation and His concern for life and sustainability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_creation.htm">Respect for Creation</a></b><br>This law teaches us to respect and care for God's creation, recognizing the balance between use and preservation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassionate_stewardship.htm">Compassionate Stewardship</a></b><br>We are called to exercise dominion with compassion, ensuring that our actions do not lead to unnecessary harm or extinction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_blessing.htm">Obedience and Blessing</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands, even in seemingly small matters, is linked to blessings and well-being, as seen in the promise of prolonged days.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sustainability_and_future_generations.htm">Sustainability and Future Generations</a></b><br>The instruction to let the mother bird go ensures the continuation of species, teaching us the importance of sustainability for future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_view_of_god's_law.htm">Holistic View of God's Law</a></b><br>This law reflects the holistic nature of God's commandments, which encompass not only human relationships but also our relationship with the environment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_22_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 22:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_22_7_God_s_care_for_creation.htm">How does Deuteronomy 22:7 demonstrate God's care for His creation?

By specifying &#8220;the young,&#8221; the Lord limits what may be taken so the family line of the bird is not extinguished. This mirrors <a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16-19</a>, where gathering manna was allowed but hoarding was forbidden&#8212;use what God provides, but within God&#8217;s boundaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But be sure to let the mother go</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;but be sure to let the mother go.&#8221; Here compassion intertwines with stewardship. <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a> notes, &#8220;The righteous care about the needs of their animals,&#8221; and <a href="/leviticus/22-28.htm">Leviticus 22:28</a> forbids slaughtering an animal and its young on the same day. By sparing the mother bird, Israel learned to value life the way the Creator does (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>). Practically, the released mother could nest again, ensuring ongoing provision. Spiritually, the act cultivated mercy, reminding people that even the smallest creatures matter to God (<a href="/luke/12-6.htm">Luke 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that it may be well with you</b><p>Obedience brings blessing: &#8220;so that it may be well with you.&#8221; This promise echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>, where walking in God&#8217;s commands ensures prosperity. When God&#8217;s people practice mercy, society flourishes&#8212;fields are productive, families are healthy, and hearts remain tender. <a href="/psalms/128-1.htm">Psalm 128:1-2</a> depicts the same pattern: fearing the Lord and walking in His ways yields personal and communal well-being.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And that you may prolong your days</b><p>The verse closes, &#8220;and that you may prolong your days.&#8221; Long life is a covenant reward, first linked to honoring parents in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2-3</a>. Here the principle broadens: honoring God&#8217;s creation is another avenue to longevity. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a> ties length of days to keeping statutes; this specific statute about a bird&#8217;s nest proves that no command is trivial. Consistent obedience&#8212;even in small matters&#8212;positions God&#8217;s people to enjoy the full span of life He intends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-7.htm">Deuteronomy 22:7</a> teaches that God allows responsible use of His creation while requiring compassion toward it. Sparing the mother bird protects future provision and nurtures a merciful heart. Such obedience invites God&#8217;s favor, resulting in present well-being and extended life. By treating even a bird&#8217;s nest with care, believers demonstrate reverence for the Creator and align themselves with the blessings He delights to give.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/22-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You may take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(tiq&#183;qa&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the young,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
