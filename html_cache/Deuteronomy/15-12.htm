In ancient Israel, economic hardship could lead individuals to sell themselves into servitude to pay off debts. This was not slavery in the modern sense but a form of bonded labor with specific protections and rights. The term "fellow Hebrew" emphasizes the shared identity and covenant relationship among the Israelites, highlighting the importance of treating one another with dignity and respect. This practice is rooted in the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, where servitude was a common means of addressing poverty and debt.<p><b>and serves you six years</b><br>The six-year period of service reflects a structured and limited term, distinguishing it from lifelong slavery. This time frame is significant as it mirrors the creation week, where God worked for six days and rested on the seventh. It underscores the principle of rest and release, which is a recurring theme in biblical law. The six-year service period also aligns with the sabbatical year, a time of economic and social reset, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>.<p><b>then in the seventh year you must set him free</b><br>The seventh year represents a time of liberation and renewal, echoing the Sabbath principle of rest and freedom. This commandment is a reflection of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt, reminding the Israelites of their own liberation and the importance of extending mercy and freedom to others. The release in the seventh year is a precursor to the Year of Jubilee, a time of restoration and return, as described in <a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>. This practice foreshadows the ultimate liberation found in Jesus Christ, who proclaimed freedom for the captives and the oppressed (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The command to set servants free is a call to justice and compassion, reflecting God's character and His desire for His people to live in community with fairness and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant.htm">Hebrew Servant</a></b><br>Refers to a fellow Israelite who, due to financial hardship, sells themselves into servitude to pay off debts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom these laws were given, emphasizing community and compassion among God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbatical_year.htm">Sabbatical Year</a></b><br>The seventh year, a time of release and freedom, reflecting God's provision and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassionate_provision.htm">God's Compassionate Provision</a></b><br>The law reflects God's heart for justice and compassion, ensuring that servitude is not perpetual but has a clear end.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_rest_and_release.htm">Principle of Rest and Release</a></b><br>The sabbatical year is a reminder of God's provision and the importance of rest and renewal, both physically and spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The Israelites were called to care for one another, ensuring that no one remained in bondage indefinitely, fostering a sense of community and mutual support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_freedom_in_christ.htm">Spiritual Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>Just as the Hebrew servant was set free, believers are reminded of the freedom they have in Christ, encouraging them to live in that freedom and extend grace to others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_15_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 15:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_15_12_s_guidance_on_service.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:12 guide us in treating those who serve us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Deut_15_12_principles_in_modern_jobs.htm">What principles from Deuteronomy 15:12 apply to modern employment practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_15_12_to_Jesus_on_servanthood.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:12 connect with Jesus' teachings on servanthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Hebrew_slaves_release_God_s_justice.htm">Why is the release of Hebrew slaves significant in understanding God's justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Deut_15_12_principles_today.htm">How can we implement Deuteronomy 15:12's principles in our community today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_15_12_on_slavery_s_ethics.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:12 address the morality of slavery in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Deut_15_12_on_Hebrew_servitude.htm">What is the historical context of Deuteronomy 15:12 regarding Hebrew servitude?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Modern_view_on_Deut_15_12_command.htm">How should modern Christians interpret the command in Deuteronomy 15:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_human_trafficking.htm">What is the Bible's stance on human trafficking?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_it_permissible_to_beat_slaves.htm">Is it permissible to beat slaves?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_the_old_testament_god_cruel.htm">Isn't the God of the Old Testament cruel and genocidal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_prayer_shawl.htm">What defines a prayer shawl?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 15:12 Mean</div><b>If a fellow Hebrew</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a> begins, &#8220;If a fellow Hebrew&#8230;&#8221;.

It first appears in <a href="/context/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2-11</a>, where it occupies the first section of the Sinaitic code. There is no need to suppose that anything enacted here is contradictory to the Law as given there; but there are certain peculiarities about the case of the female slave which create exceptions. (See below on <a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever.

The law, as here laid down, is the same as that in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>, somewhat expanded; the most important addition being that the slave is not only to go free after six years of service, but is to be furnished by his master with the means of setting up a home for himself. The six years here specified are not to be confounded with the years ending at the sabbatical year; they are any six years during which the individual has been in bondage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a fellow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
