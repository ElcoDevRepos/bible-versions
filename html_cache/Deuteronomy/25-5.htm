The family unit was central to social and economic life, and brothers often shared responsibilities and inheritance. This context emphasizes the importance of family solidarity and mutual support.<p><b>and one of them dies without a son</b><br>In ancient Israel, having a male heir was crucial for maintaining the family lineage and inheritance. A son would carry on the family name and ensure the continuation of property within the family. The absence of a son created a significant issue, as it threatened the family's future and stability.<p><b>the widow must not marry outside the family</b><br>This directive underscores the importance of keeping property and lineage within the family. Marrying outside the family could result in the loss of property and disrupt the tribal inheritance system established by God. It reflects the cultural and legal practices of the time, where family and tribal identity were paramount.<p><b>Her husband&#8217;s brother is to take her as his wife</b><br>This practice, known as levirate marriage, was a customary law in ancient Israel. It served to protect the widow and ensure the deceased brother's name and property remained within the family. This law is also seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz, where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law for her</b><br>The duty of a brother-in-law, or levir, was to marry the widow and produce offspring in the name of the deceased brother. This act of redemption and responsibility highlights themes of loyalty, family duty, and the preservation of the family line. It also foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who fulfills the law and redeems His people, ensuring their place in the family of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/brothers.htm">Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to male siblings living together, sharing familial responsibilities and inheritance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/widow.htm">Widow</a></b><br>The wife of the deceased brother, who is left without a son to carry on the family name.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband's_brother.htm">Husband&#8217;s Brother</a></b><br>The surviving brother who is called to marry the widow to preserve the family lineage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_community.htm">Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context in which these laws were given, emphasizing the importance of family and inheritance within the Israelite society.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/levirate_marriage.htm">Levirate Marriage</a></b><br>The cultural and legal practice described in this verse, where a brother-in-law marries the widow to produce offspring for the deceased brother.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preservation_of_family_lineage.htm">Preservation of Family Lineage</a></b><br>The command underscores the importance of family continuity and inheritance in ancient Israelite society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/care_for_widows.htm">Care for Widows</a></b><br>This law reflects God's concern for the vulnerable, ensuring that widows are cared for and not left destitute.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The practice of levirate marriage demonstrates obedience to God's laws, which were designed to maintain social order and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_modern_application.htm">Cultural Context and Modern Application</a></b><br>While the specific practice may not apply today, the underlying principles of family responsibility and care for the vulnerable remain relevant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_redeemer.htm">Christ as Our Redeemer</a></b><br>Just as the brother-in-law redeems the widow, Christ redeems us, bringing us into His family and ensuring our spiritual inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_25_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 25:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_25_5_on_family_duty_lineage_care.htm">How does Deuteronomy 25:5 emphasize family responsibility and preservation of lineage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Brother-in-law_s_role_in_Deut_25_5.htm">What role does the brother-in-law play according to Deuteronomy 25:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_25_5_to_Ruth-Boaz_story.htm">How does Deuteronomy 25:5 connect to the story of Ruth and Boaz?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Deut_25_5_to_modern_families.htm">In what ways can we apply Deuteronomy 25:5's principles to modern family dynamics?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_25_5_God_s_family_community_plan.htm">How does Deuteronomy 25:5 reflect God's design for family and community support?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_levirate_marriage_in_Deut_25_5.htm">What is the purpose of the levirate marriage law in Deuteronomy 25:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_25_5_s_cultural_context.htm">How does Deuteronomy 25:5 reflect the cultural context of ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_family_lineage_key_in_Deut_25_5.htm">Why is the continuation of a family line important in Deuteronomy 25:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_levirate_marriage_conflict_biblically.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5&#8211;10: Does the levirate marriage requirement conflict with other Biblical passages on remarriage or widows?

We first hear of it in the household of Judah the son of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/38-8.htm" title="And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.">Genesis 38:8</a>). The violation of the law then was punished with <span class= "ital">death, </span>not with disgrace only.<p>But that which makes the law most memorable, is the teaching elicited from the lips of our Saviour by the question which the Sadducees raised upon it (see marginal reference). It is worth while to observe that the law itself demands that in some sense there should be <span class= "ital">a resurrection. </span>Boaz puts it thus (<a href="/ruth/4-5.htm" title="Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.">Ruth 4:5</a>), "to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance." Why should the name of the dead be kept up, if the dead has passed out of existence? We may well believe that this law was partly intended (like baptism for the dead, or like giving children the names of their departed progenitors) for the express purpose of keeping alive the hope of resurrection in the minds of the chosen people.<p>(11,12) <span class= "bld">When men strive together. . . .--</span>Another precept of humanity. In <a href="/exodus/21-22.htm" title="If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.">Exodus 21:22</a>, "If men strive and hurt a woman with child," punishment or compensation must follow. The law in this place is the counterpart of that. Men must be protected as well as women. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-10.</span> <span class="accented">- Levirate marriages</span>. If a man who was married died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to raise up a successor to the deceased, who should be his heir. The brother who refused this duty must be publicly disgraced. The design of this institution - which was not originated by Moses, but came down from early times (<a href="/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>), and is to be found amongst ether nations than the Jews, and that even in the present day - was to preserve a family from becoming extinct and to secure the property of a family from passing into the hands of a stranger. The notion that the usage "had its natural roots in the desire inherent in man who is born for immortality, and connected with the hitherto undeveloped belief in an eternal life, to secure a continued personal existence for himself and immortality for his name through the perpetuation of his family, and in the life of the son who took his place" (Keil), seems wholly fanciful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dwell together</span>;
