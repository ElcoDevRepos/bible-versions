It highlights the seriousness of Israel's disobedience and the potential consequences. This reflects the covenant relationship where blessings and curses are contingent upon Israel's faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>that I would cut them to pieces</b><br>The imagery of being "cut to pieces" signifies total destruction. This is a metaphor for severe judgment, often used in the Old Testament to describe the fate of nations that oppose God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). It underscores the gravity of Israel's sin and the potential for divine retribution.<p><b>and blot out their memory from mankind</b><br>To "blot out their memory" suggests complete eradication, leaving no trace of existence. This echoes the fate of the Amalekites (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>) and other nations judged by God. It serves as a warning of the ultimate consequence of persistent rebellion against God. The concept of memory in ancient cultures was tied to legacy and honor, making this a severe punishment.<p><b>from mankind</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the judgment, extending beyond Israel to the perception of all humanity. It reflects the universal scope of God's authority and the seriousness of Israel's role as a witness to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>). The potential for such judgment underscores the importance of Israel's obedience in fulfilling their covenantal role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of the song in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, Moses is delivering a message from God to the Israelites.

His &#8220;I would have said&#8221; is not indecision but a deliberate disclosure of divine intention, much like <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a> where He tells Moses, &#8220;Now leave Me alone, so that My anger may burn against them and consume them.&#8221; The Lord is perfectly just and has every right to carry out the threatened judgment (<a href="/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; This statement reminds us that God&#8217;s plans are never thwarted; yet He often reveals what could have happened to underscore both His holiness and His mercy (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also sets up verse 27, where He explains why total annihilation is withheld&#8212;for the sake of His own reputation among the nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That I would cut them to pieces</b><p>Here the Lord speaks of decisive, violent judgment. &#8220;Cut them to pieces&#8221; evokes the covenant curses spelled out earlier: &#8220;The LORD will strike you with wasting disease&#8230; with the sword&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22, 25</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language appears in <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-33</a> when God foretells the downfall of Eli&#8217;s house, and in <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15-16</a> where He promises to &#8220;consume&#8221; the proud Assyrian.<p>&#8226; The idea is physical destruction plus national dismemberment&#8212;scattering tribes, breaking their power (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Such severity proves God&#8217;s intolerance of idolatry and His faithfulness to His own covenant terms (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a> echoes this principle for the New Covenant believer).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And blot out their memory from mankind</b><p>The ultimate penalty would be total erasure, as happened to Sodom (Jude 7) or Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>). To &#8220;blot out&#8221; is to remove from history&#8217;s record; no descendants, no legacy, no remembrance (<a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God did not let this happen to Israel. Verse 27 explains He restrained judgment so that &#8220;their adversaries would misconstrue.&#8221; His name and His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob could not be mocked (<a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9-11</a>; <a href="/romans/9-29.htm">Romans 9:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This restraint foreshadows the gospel: though judgment was deserved, God chose mercy for the sake of His glory, ultimately satisfied in Christ (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/32-26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26</a> reveals the severity of divine justice and the tenderness of divine restraint. God could have spoken the final word of destruction&#8212;cutting Israel to pieces and wiping their memory from the earth&#8212;yet He held back to protect His name and fulfill His covenant. The verse stands as a sober warning against presuming on grace, while assuring believers that the same God who judges righteously also preserves His people for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26, 27) The argument of these verses is such as no man would dare to put into the mouth of the Most High. Moses had pleaded it (in <a href="/context/numbers/14-13.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)">Numbers 14:13-16</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>), but none but Jehovah Himself would say for Himself, "<span class= "ital">I feared the wrath of the enemy."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - Israel's desert was to be utterly destroyed, but God refrained from this for his own Name's sake. <span class="cmt_word">I said, I would scatter them into corners</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">should say</span>, <span class="accented">I trill blow them away</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. disperse them as by a mighty wind. The verb here is the Hiph, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to breathe, to blow, and is found only here. The rabbins make it a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, a corner, and this the Authorized Version follows; others trace it to an Arabic root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">amputavit</span>, <span class="accented">excidit</span>, and render, "will cut them off." The idea intended to be conveyed is obviously that of entire destruction, and this is not satisfied by the representation of their being scared or driven into corners. <span class="cmt_word">Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy.</span> Various renderings and interpretations of this passage have been given. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that I should be provoked to wrath by the enemy ascribing the destruction of Israel to their own prowess. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">Were it not that I feared a wrath upon the enemy</span>, with much the same meaning. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="accented">Were it not that I feared the fury of the enemy</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. against Israel - feared lest the enemy should be encouraged to rise up against Israel and ascribe their destruction to their own valor. Of these that most generally approved is the first. (On this reason for sparing Israel, see <a href="/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, etc.; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13, 14</a>.) Should behave themselves strangely; rather, <span class="accented">should mistake</span> or <span class="accented">falsely pretend</span>. The verb is the Piel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to look upon, to mark, and conveys the idea of looking on askance or prejudicially, hence being ignorant of, mistaking, feigning, or falsely pretending. Our hand is high; rather, <span class="accented">was high</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. was mighty in power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 28-33.</span> - The cause of Israel's rejection was that they were a people utterly destitute of counsel and without understanding.
