It signifies a transition from a life of slavery in Egypt to a life of freedom and divine blessing. The land is a gift from God, symbolizing His faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. This transition also represents a spiritual journey from bondage to sin to the freedom found in God's promises.<p><b>is not like the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt, in biblical context, often symbolizes bondage and oppression. The Israelites' experience in Egypt was marked by slavery and hardship. The contrast here highlights the difference between a life of self-reliance and one of divine provision. Egypt relied heavily on the Nile River for irrigation, representing human effort and control. The Promised Land, in contrast, would be sustained by God's provision, emphasizing reliance on Him.<p><b>from which you have come</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of the Israelites' past and the deliverance God provided. It underscores the importance of remembering God's past faithfulness as a foundation for trusting Him in the future. The journey from Egypt to Canaan is a central narrative in the Bible, symbolizing redemption and salvation.<p><b>where you sowed your seed and irrigated on foot</b><br>In Egypt, agriculture depended on manual labor and the annual flooding of the Nile. The phrase "irrigated on foot" suggests the labor-intensive methods used to water crops, such as using foot-powered shadufs or other manual irrigation techniques. This reflects a life of toil and human effort, contrasting with the ease and abundance promised in Canaan.<p><b>like a vegetable garden</b><br>A vegetable garden requires constant care and attention, symbolizing the Israelites' dependence on their own efforts in Egypt. This imagery contrasts with the Promised Land, which would be nourished by rain from heaven, symbolizing God's direct provision and blessing. The comparison emphasizes the shift from human effort to divine grace, pointing to a life of faith and trust in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's message to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered, characterized by manual labor and dependence on human effort for agriculture.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, described as a land flowing with milk and honey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, leading them towards the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/contrast_between_human_effort_and_divine_provision.htm">Contrast Between Human Effort and Divine Provision</a></b><br>The Israelites' experience in Egypt required human effort for sustenance, symbolizing reliance on self.

And even this was not so good as the land of Israel" (Rashi).<p><span class= "bld">Wateredst it with thy foot.</span>--An allusion either to the necessity of <span class= "ital">carrying </span>the water or to the custom of turning the water into little channels with the foot, as it flowed through the garden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - An additional motive to fidelity and obedience is here adduced, drawn from the peculiar excellence and advantages of the land. Canaan was not like Egypt, a country that depended for its fertility on being irrigated by man's labor or by artificial processes, but was a land where the supply and distribution of water was provided for in natural reservoirs and channels, by means of which the rain which God, who cared for the land, sent plentifully on it, was made available for useful purposes. In Egypt there is little or no rain, and the people are dependent on the annual overflowing of the Nile for the proper irrigation of their fields; and as this lasts only for a short period, the water has to be stored and redistributed by artificial means, often of a very laborious kind. Wateredst it with thy foot. "The reference, perhaps, is to the manner of conducting the water about from plant to plant and from furrow to furrow. I have often watched the gardener at this fatiguing and unhealthy work. When one place is sufficiently saturated, he pushes aside the sandy soil between it and the next furrow with his foot, and thus continues to do until all are watered. He is thus knee-deep in mud, and many are the diseases generated by this slavish work. Or the reference may be to certain kinds of hydraulic machines which were turned by the feet. I have seen small water-wheels, on the plain of Acre and elsewhere, which were thus worked; and it appeared to me to be very tedious and toilsome, and, if the whole country had to be irrigated by such a process, it would require a nation of slaves like the Hebrews, and taskmasters like the Egyptians, to make it succeed. Whatever may have been the meaning of Moses, the Hebrews no doubt had learned by bitter experience what it was <span class="accented">to water with the foot</span>; and this would add great force to the allusion, and render doubly precious the goodly land which drank of the rain of heaven, and required no such drudgery to make it fruitful" (Thomson, ' The Land and the Book,' 2:279; edit. Lend. 1859). Philo describes a machine cf. this sort as in use in Egypt ('De Confus. Linguar.,' Opp. 1:410, edit. Mangey); and in that country, "a garden of herbs" is still generally watered by means of a machine of simple construction, consisting of a wheel, round which revolves an endless rope to which buckets are attached; this is worked by the feet of a man seated on a piece of wood fastened by the side of the machine, labor at once monotonous and severe (Niebuhr, 'Voyage en Arabic,' 1:121, 4to, Amst. 1776; 'Description de l'Arabic,' 1:219, 4to, Paris, 1779; Robinson, 'Bib. lies.,' 1:542; 2:21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
