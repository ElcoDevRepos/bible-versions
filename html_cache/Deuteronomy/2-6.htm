In the context of Deuteronomy, the Israelites were passing through the land of the Edomites, descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. The command to pay in silver reflects a principle of justice and integrity, ensuring that the Israelites did not take advantage of their kin. Silver, a common medium of exchange in the ancient Near East, signifies the value and fairness expected in transactions. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>, which speaks to giving everyone what you owe them.<p><b>for the food you eat</b><br>The Israelites were instructed to purchase food, highlighting the importance of sustaining life through legitimate means. This reflects God's provision and the expectation of self-sufficiency, even during their wilderness journey. The act of buying food rather than taking it by force underscores a peaceful coexistence with neighboring nations. This approach contrasts with the conquest of Canaan, where God commanded the Israelites to take possession of the land. The emphasis on purchasing food also points to the broader biblical theme of God providing for His people, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, "Give us this day our daily bread."<p><b>and the water you drink.</b><br>Water, a vital resource in the arid regions of the Near East, was to be purchased, underscoring the respect for the resources of others. This command reflects the cultural and historical context where water rights were crucial for survival. The Israelites' need to buy water highlights their dependence on God&#8217;s guidance and provision during their journey. This act of purchasing water also serves as a reminder of the spiritual thirst that only God can quench, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of the living water that leads to eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>Descendants of Esau, living in the region of Seir, whom the Israelites are instructed to pass through peacefully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, conveying God's instructions to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_journey.htm">Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of 40 years when the Israelites wandered in the desert before entering Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_seir.htm">Mount Seir</a></b><br>The region inhabited by the Edomites, which the Israelites are passing through.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_others'_property.htm">Respect for Others' Property</a></b><br>The Israelites are instructed to pay for what they consume, teaching us the importance of respecting others' resources and property.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peaceful_coexistence.htm">Peaceful Coexistence</a></b><br>God commands the Israelites to pass through Edom peacefully, reminding us of the value of living in harmony with others, even those with whom we have historical tensions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The Israelites' adherence to God's command to pay for food and water demonstrates the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Despite being in the wilderness, God provides for the Israelites, teaching us to trust in His provision in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/financial_integrity.htm">Financial Integrity</a></b><br>The command to pay in silver underscores the importance of financial integrity and fair dealings in our interactions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_2_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_2_6_on_fair_trade_respect_property.htm">How does Deuteronomy 2:6 emphasize fair trade and respect for others' property?
