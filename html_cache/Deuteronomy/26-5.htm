It reflects the importance of verbalizing faith and history as a form of worship and remembrance. The act of declaring before God is a reminder of His sovereignty and the Israelites' dependence on Him. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, where verbal declarations are used in worship, such as in Psalms and the recitation of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>.<p><b>&#8220;My father was a wandering Aramean</b><br>This refers to Jacob, also known as Israel, who is considered the patriarch of the Israelites. The term "wandering Aramean" highlights Jacob's nomadic lifestyle and his connection to the region of Aram, which is modern-day Syria. This phrase underscores the humble beginnings of the Israelite nation, emphasizing their dependence on God's guidance and provision. The wandering nature of Jacob's life is a type of the spiritual journey of faith, reflecting the Christian pilgrimage towards the heavenly promise.<p><b>and he went down to Egypt few in number</b><br>This part of the declaration recalls the migration of Jacob and his family to Egypt during a time of famine, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>. The phrase "few in number" highlights the small size of Jacob's family at the time, which consisted of 70 people. This migration was part of God's providential plan to preserve and grow the nation of Israel. The journey to Egypt is a significant event in biblical history, setting the stage for the eventual Exodus and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham.<p><b>and lived there and became a great nation</b><br>In Egypt, the Israelites multiplied and grew into a large and powerful nation, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>. This growth was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The transformation from a small family to a great nation in a foreign land demonstrates God's faithfulness and the unfolding of His redemptive plan. This growth also foreshadows the expansion of the Church, as seen in the New Testament, where the Gospel spreads from a small group of disciples to a global community.<p><b>mighty and numerous</b><br>The description of the Israelites as "mighty and numerous" reflects their strength and significant population by the time of the Exodus. This transformation is a testament to God's blessing and protection over His people, despite their oppression in Egypt. The might and numbers of Israel serve as a precursor to their eventual conquest of Canaan, fulfilling God's promise to give them a land of their own. This phrase also points to the spiritual strength and growth of believers, as seen in the New Testament Church, empowered by the Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_father.htm">My Father (Jacob/Israel)</a></b><br>The reference to "my father" is traditionally understood to be Jacob, also known as Israel, who was the patriarch of the Israelites.

The translation "ready to perish" fairly represents the Hebrew; the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means not merely to stray or wander, but also to lose one's self, to perish, to be in danger of perishing (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>, etc.).
