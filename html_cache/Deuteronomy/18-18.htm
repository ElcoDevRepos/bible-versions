Moses was a unique leader, lawgiver, and mediator between God and Israel. The promise of a prophet "like you" suggests a leader with similar authority and intimacy with God. This prophecy is often seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who is considered the ultimate fulfillment of this promise. In the New Testament, Peter and Stephen both reference this prophecy in <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a> and <a href="/acts/7-37.htm">Acts 7:37</a>, respectively, identifying Jesus as the prophet like Moses.<p><b>from among their brothers</b><br>This indicates that the prophet will be an Israelite, coming from the people of Israel. It emphasizes the continuity of God's work through the chosen nation. The phrase "from among their brothers" underscores the prophet's shared heritage and identity with the people he will lead. This is significant in the context of Jesus, who was born into the tribe of Judah, fulfilling the requirement of being an Israelite.<p><b>I will put My words in his mouth</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine inspiration and authority of the prophet's message. The prophet will speak not on his own behalf but as a mouthpiece for God. This is a key characteristic of true prophecy, distinguishing it from false prophets who speak their own words. In the context of Jesus, this is seen in <a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>, where Jesus states that He speaks only what the Father has commanded Him.<p><b>and he will tell them everything I command him</b><br>The prophet's role is to faithfully communicate God's commands to the people. This underscores the responsibility and accountability of the prophet to deliver God's message accurately and completely. Jesus exemplified this by teaching and revealing God's will to humanity, as seen throughout the Gospels. His teachings are considered the ultimate revelation of God's commands, fulfilling the role of the prophet described in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the Law to Israel.

Born within Israel, He carries God&#8217;s own words and faithfully delivers the full message. The New Testament repeatedly identifies Jesus as this promised Prophet, fulfilling every detail literally. Listening to Him is not optional; it is the divinely mandated path to truth, life, and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And will put my words in his mouth</span>; will so reveal to him my mind, and so inspire him to utter it, that the words he speaks shall be really my words. The question has been raised whether, by the Prophet like unto Moses, here promised to the people of Israel, is to be understood some eminent individual, or whether this refers to the prophetic <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, or succession, that was to continue under the theocracy. For the latter the context strongly speaks, for <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the contrast between what God here forbids the Israelites to do, viz. to resort to diviners and soothsayers, and the provision he would make for them so as to render this needless, point to a succession of prophets rather than to one individual; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the reference in what follows to the discrimination of false prophets from true prophets, shows that a multiplicity and a succession of prophets was in the view of the speaker, not a single individual; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as a succession of priests, of judges, and of kings was contemplated in this part of the Mosaic legislation, the presumption is that a succession also of prophets was contemplated. At the same time, the use of the singular here is remarkable, for nowhere else is the singular, <span class="accented">nabhi</span>, employed to designate more than one individual; and this <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the reference here may be to some individual in whom not only was the succession to culminate as in its crown and eminence, but whose spirit was to pervade the whole succession, - that each member of it should exercise his functions only as that Spirit which was in them did signify (<a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>). It is possible also, as Oryon Gerlach has suggested, that "Prophet" here may be used as "<span class="accented">seed"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, and that this is a prediction of Christ as the True Prophet, just as the assurance to Eve was a prediction of the Messiah, who, as the Head and Crown of the" godly seed," should end the conflict with the serpent and his seed by a crushing victory. It is to be considered also that, whilst the words "like unto me" do not necessarily imply a resemblance in <span class="accented">all</span> respects between Moses and the Prophet here promised, and whilst they may be well applied to One superior in many respects to Moses, it would be taking them at much below their real worth were we to understand them of one greatly inferior to Moses, as all the prophets who succeeded him in Israel were until the Chief came (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). Finally, there can be no doubt that the Jews expected that the Messiah would appear as the Prophet by pre-eminence, and that they founded that expectation on the promise here recorded (cf. <a href="/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>; <a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-26</a>; <a href="/acts/7-37.htm">Acts 7:37</a>). It may be added that our Lord seems to apply this to himself, when he says to the Jews, "There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me" (<a href="/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45, 46</a>; cf. also John 11:48-50). How early and how widespread was the expectation that the Messiah would come as a prophet, may be inferred from the existence of this among the Samaritans (<a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It is to be concluded, then, that this promise has reference ultimately to the Messiah, the Great Revealer of God, between whom and Moses there should be a long succession of prophets, so that there should always be a medium of Divine communication between Jehovah and his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will raise up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for them a prophet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5030.htm">Strong's 5030: </a> </span><span class="str2">A spokesman, speaker, prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
