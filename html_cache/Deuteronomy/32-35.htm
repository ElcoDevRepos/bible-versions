In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is delivering a song to the Israelites, reminding them of God's power and righteousness. The concept of divine vengeance is rooted in the understanding that God alone has the authority to judge and execute justice. This is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where Paul advises believers to leave room for God's wrath. The idea is that human retribution is flawed, but God's justice is perfect and will be executed in His timing. This phrase also reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to protect and avenge His people against their enemies.<p><b>In due time their foot will slip;</b><br>This phrase suggests the inevitability of judgment for those who oppose God. The imagery of a foot slipping indicates a sudden and unexpected downfall, highlighting the precariousness of relying on one's own strength or defying God. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be seen as a warning to those who are arrogant or complacent, thinking they are secure without God. The phrase serves as a reminder of the moral and spiritual laws that govern the universe, which God enforces in His timing. It also connects to the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where the consequences of wickedness are often depicted as a fall or stumble.<p><b>For their day of disaster is near,</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the certainty and imminence of divine judgment. The "day of disaster" is a common theme in prophetic literature, often referring to a time when God will act decisively against sin and rebellion. This can be seen in the context of the Old Testament prophets who warned Israel and other nations of impending judgment due to their disobedience. The phrase serves as both a warning and a call to repentance, urging people to turn back to God before it is too late. It also foreshadows the ultimate day of the Lord, a concept that is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation.<p><b>And their doom is coming quickly.</b><br>The final phrase reinforces the urgency and certainty of God's judgment. The use of the word "quickly" suggests that while God's patience is long, His justice will not be delayed indefinitely. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance. In the broader biblical context, this can be seen as a call to live righteously and to trust in God's timing for justice. Theologically, it points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan for redemption and judgment, culminating in the return of Christ, who will judge the living and the dead. This phrase assures believers that God's justice will prevail, providing hope and encouragement in the face of injustice and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering a song to the Israelites as a reminder of God's justice and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' song, who are reminded of God's sovereignty and the consequences of turning away from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, asserting His role as the ultimate judge and avenger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination of the Israelites, where they are to live according to God's laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_disaster.htm">Day of Disaster</a></b><br>A prophetic warning of the consequences that will befall those who oppose God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty in Justice</a></b><br>Trust in God's perfect timing and justice.
