In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is preparing the Israelites for life in the Promised Land, where they will need to establish a system of governance. The law given by these leaders is rooted in the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were considered the direct revelation from God. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's society, where civil and religious laws were intertwined. The authority of the priests and judges is seen as divinely appointed, and their interpretations are to be respected as coming from God Himself. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus affirms the importance of the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-19</a>) but also fulfills and transcends it.<p><b>and the verdict they proclaim</b><br>The verdict refers to the decisions made by the appointed leaders in legal matters. In ancient Israel, the priests and judges served as mediators of God's justice, ensuring that the community lived according to His statutes. This system of justice was designed to maintain order and righteousness within the nation. The role of these leaders can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate judge and lawgiver (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>). The emphasis on their proclamation underscores the importance of adhering to their decisions, as they are seen as extensions of God's will.<p><b>Do not turn aside to the right or to the left</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical expression that signifies staying on the correct path, both morally and spiritually. It is a call to obedience and faithfulness, urging the Israelites to adhere strictly to the law without deviation. This concept is reiterated throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, where Joshua is instructed to follow the law without turning aside. It highlights the importance of steadfastness in one's faith and actions, a theme that is central to the biblical narrative. In a broader sense, it points to the need for believers to remain focused on God's commandments and not be swayed by external influences or personal desires.<p><b>from the decision they declare to you</b><br>This final phrase reinforces the authority of the leaders' decisions and the necessity of compliance. The Israelites are reminded that the decisions made by their leaders are binding and must be followed. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience to His appointed leaders is part of their commitment to Him. The concept of divine authority and obedience is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are called to submit to governing authorities as instituted by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>). This submission is ultimately an act of faith and trust in God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live according to God's laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges_and_priests.htm">Judges and Priests</a></b><br>Appointed leaders responsible for interpreting and teaching the law to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where the Israelites are headed and where these laws will be applied.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_law.htm">God's Law</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to guide the moral, civil, and ceremonial life of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_scripture.htm">Authority of Scripture</a></b><br>The verse underscores the importance of adhering to God's law as taught by appointed leaders.

Verse 11 lands right in the middle of that scene, telling the ordinary Israelite how to respond once the leadership rules. Before moving on, notice two things:<p>&#8226; The setting is God&#8217;s chosen place of worship, not a civil courthouse alone (De 17:8, 10; cf. De 12:5).<p>&#8226; The issue can be criminal, civil, or ceremonial; if it&#8217;s too complex for local elders (De 16:18), it goes &#8220;up&#8221; to the priests and the judge (<a href="/exodus/18-22.htm">Exodus 18:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8-10</a>).<p>With that context in mind, the verse divides neatly into three phrases.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the terms of the law they give you</b><p>&#8220;According to the terms of the law they teach you&#8221;. Here, the priests are not inventing new rules; they are interpreting and applying the already-revealed Torah.<p>&#8226; Ezra later models this same calling: &#8220;For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD and to practice it and to teach His statutes&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Malachi rebukes later priests for failing in it: &#8220;For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus honors Moses&#8217; seat, saying, &#8220;So you must do and observe whatever they tell you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2-3</a>), affirming the weight of lawful teaching even while condemning hypocrisy.<p>Takeaway: God places spiritual leaders to clarify His Word. Their interpretations stand because the Word stands, not because leaders are infallible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The verdict they proclaim</b><p>&#8220;and the verdict they pronounce, you must do&#8221;. Once the court weighs the evidence, it renders a binding decision.<p>&#8226; Solomon fills this role at the dedication of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-31.htm">1 Kings 8:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; The Jerusalem council in <a href="/bsb/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> follows the same pattern&#8212;Scripture examined, judgment rendered&#8212;binding Gentile believers to certain essentials.<p>&#8226; Paul invokes the right of appeal within Roman law (<a href="/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>), showing that even secular verdicts possess authority under God (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p>Takeaway: God values due process. A rightly constituted decision is His instrument for justice and order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not turn aside to the right or to the left</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;do not deviate to the right or to the left&#8221;. This phrase shows up often in Deuteronomy (De 5:32; 28:14), always calling for wholehearted obedience.<p>&#8226; Joshua receives the same charge at the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Kings are warned to copy the law daily so they won&#8217;t &#8220;turn aside&#8221; (De 17:18-20; <a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> echoes it for church life: &#8220;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls.&#8221;<p>Takeaway: Obedience is not selective. Once God&#8217;s Word has been rightly interpreted and applied, believers are to follow fully, resisting both legalism (adding to the right) and laxity (subtracting to the left).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a> calls God&#8217;s people to three linked responses: listen to Scripture as taught by God-appointed leaders; accept their judgment when it faithfully applies that Scripture; and follow through without swerving. In this way, the community stays anchored to God&#8217;s revealed will, enjoys social order, and mirrors the steadfast obedience that He deserves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">according</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the terms</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;t&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
