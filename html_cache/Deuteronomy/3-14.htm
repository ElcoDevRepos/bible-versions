Manasseh was the firstborn son of Joseph, who was one of the twelve sons of Jacob. The tribe of Manasseh was divided into two half-tribes, one settling on the east side of the Jordan River and the other on the west. Jair belonged to the eastern half-tribe, which was known for its valor and military prowess. This connection to Manasseh highlights the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph's sons, where he prophesied that they would become a great people (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>).<p><b>took the whole region of Argob</b><br>The region of Argob was a fertile and strategic area located in Bashan, east of the Jordan River. Known for its fortified cities and rich pastures, Argob was a significant conquest for the Israelites. The capture of this region by Jair demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan and its surrounding territories (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>). The conquest of Argob also signifies the expansion of Israel's territory and influence during this period.<p><b>as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites</b><br>The Geshurites and Maacathites were neighboring peoples who lived in the region northeast of the Sea of Galilee. These groups maintained their distinct identities and were not fully conquered by the Israelites, as noted in other biblical passages (<a href="/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>). The mention of these borders indicates the extent of Jair's conquest and the geographical boundaries of Israel's influence at the time. It also reflects the ongoing challenges Israel faced in fully possessing the land due to the presence of other nations.<p><b>He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair</b><br>Renaming places was a common practice in ancient times, often signifying ownership or commemorating a significant event. By renaming Bashan as Havvoth-jair, which means "villages of Jair," Jair established his legacy and marked his authority over the region. This act of renaming is similar to other biblical instances where individuals renamed locations to reflect divine encounters or personal achievements (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>, <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>).<p><b>by which it is called to this day</b><br>The phrase "to this day" suggests that the name Havvoth-jair persisted for a considerable time, indicating the lasting impact of Jair's conquest and influence. This enduring name serves as a historical marker, reminding future generations of the victories and territorial expansions achieved by the Israelites. It also underscores the reliability of the biblical narrative, as the names and places mentioned have historical and archaeological significance that can be traced through time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jair.htm">Jair</a></b><br>A descendant of Manasseh, one of the tribes of Israel.

That connection matters, because God had already promised the descendants of Joseph a rich inheritance east of the Jordan&#8212;an oath He now keeps in tangible territory (<a href="/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39-41</a> tells how the clan of Machir (a branch of Manasseh) captured Gilead and how Jair gained renown there. First Chronicles 2:21-23 fills in more family detail, underscoring that Scripture consistently ties Jair back to the promises made to the patriarchs.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness is the steady backdrop: every time we meet Jair, the text reminds us that divine promises travel through real people and real places.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>took the whole region of Argob</b><p>&#8226; Argob sits in Bashan, a volcanic high-plain famous for its 60 fortified cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>). Those walled towns boasted &#8220;gates and bars of bronze,&#8221; the kind of boast that would intimidate any human army&#8212;yet the Lord delivered them all.<p>&#8226; First Kings 4:13 later groups Argob with &#8220;all the region of Argob in Bashan&#8212;sixty great cities,&#8221; confirming that the area remained distinctly recognized centuries later.<p>&#8226; When the verse says Jair &#8220;took&#8221; Argob, it celebrates a literal conquest accomplished under God&#8217;s command (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-31.htm">Deuteronomy 2:31-33</a>). No myth, no metaphor&#8212;just covenant faithfulness played out on rugged terrain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites</b><p>&#8226; Geshur and Maacah were small Aramean kingdoms north of the Sea of Galilee. <a href="/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a> notes that Israel never fully drove them out, and Second Samuel 3:3 shows later complications when David marries Maacah of Geshur.<p>&#8226; The border reference pinpoints how far Jair&#8217;s victories spread, drawing a clear map line for future generations. It also hints that unfinished business remained; Israel still shared boundaries with peoples who would test their loyalty to God.<p>&#8226; Even here the text stands historically grounded&#8212;real neighbors, real borders, real political tension.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He renamed Bashan after himself</b><p>&#8226; Renaming a land was common when God granted victory (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-26.htm">Joshua 7:26</a>). By calling the captured zone &#8220;Havvoth-jair,&#8221; Jair publicly acknowledged God&#8217;s gift while marking family stewardship.<p>&#8226; This isn&#8217;t ego-driven empire building; it&#8217;s a memorial: &#8220;Look what the Lord allowed our house to do.&#8221; <a href="/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3-4</a> later recalls 30 towns still bearing the name, showing that the memorial stuck.<p>&#8226; Scripture keeps weaving private faith and public geography together&#8212;what God does in a man ripples into maps and place names.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Havvoth-jair, by which it is called to this day</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Havvoth&#8221; simply means &#8220;villages,&#8221; so the phrase reads &#8220;Villages of Jair.&#8221; By Moses&#8217; final sermon (circa 1406 BC), the label was already fixed.<p>&#8226; The refrain &#8220;to this day&#8221; appears throughout Deuteronomy (e.g., 2:22; 10:8) as Moses&#8217; real-time footnote: you can still go see these villages. That anchoring detail underscores the accuracy of the narrative.<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>, written generations later, still uses the same name. The Bible&#8217;s internal consistency here underlines its straightforward historical claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> records an actual slice of Israel&#8217;s conquest history: Jair, a Manassite, seized the formidable Argob plateau up to the borders of Geshur and Maacah, then commemorated God&#8217;s victory by renaming the region Havvoth-jair. Every phrase grounds us in covenant fulfillment&#8212;God&#8217;s promise to Joseph&#8217;s descendants, the precise geography of Bashan, and a place-name that endured for centuries as living proof of divine faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Jair took . . . unto this day.</span>--The last words of this chapter seem to point to a later hand, as of Joshua, describing the completion of the conquest.

As <span class="accented">Geshur</span> signifies a bridge, it has been conjectured that the Geshurites were located near some well-known bridge across the Jordan, of which, perhaps, they were the keepers, and from this took their name. Maachah is called Aram (Syria) Maachah in <a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>. According to the 'Ono-masticon,' it was "a city of the Amorites, by the Jordan, near Mount Hermon" (<span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;</span>). It had in later times a king, who allied himself with the Ammonites against David (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>). These tribes were subdued, but not destroyed, by the Israelites; and at a later period seem to have regained their independence, and to have formed one kingdom (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-2.htm">1 Chronicles 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair</span>.

These were recaptured by the Geshurites, aided by the Arameans (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a>, "And Geshur and Aram took Chavvoth-Jair from them," etc.); at what time is unknown. From <a href="/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>, it appears that Nobah, also a family descended from Machir, took certain towns, viz. "Kenath and her daughters" in this district; these, with the twenty-three Hay-voth-Jair, made up the sixty towns which "belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead" (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a>). Nobah was probably in some way subordinate to Jair, and so in this rhetorical discourse, where it is not the purpose of the author to enter on minute details, the whole of these cities are included under the name Havvoth-Jair. Unto this day. "This does not necessarily imply a long time; and Moses himself may have used this expression, though only shortly after the event, in order to give prominence to the capture of the fortified cities of the giant' king Og, by the Manassites for the encouragement of the Israelites" (Herzheimer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jair,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2971.htm">Strong's 2971: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jair -- 'he enlightens', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a descendant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Manasseh,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;na&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4519.htm">Strong's 4519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manasseh -- 'causing to forget', a son of Joseph, also a king of Judah, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">region</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2256.htm">Strong's 2256: </a> </span><span class="str2">A rope, a measuring line, a district, inheritance, a noose, a company, a throe, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Argob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;g&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_709.htm">Strong's 709: </a> </span><span class="str2">Argob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as far as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the border</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1366.htm">Strong's 1366: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cord, a boundary, the territory inclosed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Geshurites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
