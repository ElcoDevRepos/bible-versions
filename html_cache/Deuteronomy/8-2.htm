This period symbolizes a generation's lifespan and is often seen as a time of testing and preparation. The number forty is frequently used in the Bible to denote periods of trial or judgment, such as the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness</b><br>God's guidance through the wilderness underscores His sovereignty and faithfulness. Despite the Israelites' frequent disobedience, God provided direction and sustenance, such as manna and water from the rock. This journey through the wilderness is a type of the Christian life, where believers are led by God through trials and challenges toward spiritual maturity and the ultimate promise of eternal life.<p><b>so that He might humble you</b><br>Humility was a key lesson for the Israelites, who often displayed pride and self-reliance. The wilderness experience stripped them of their self-sufficiency, teaching them dependence on God. This humbling process is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to humble themselves under God's mighty hand (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<p><b>and test you</b><br>Testing in the wilderness was meant to reveal the Israelites' faith and obedience. This concept of testing is seen throughout Scripture, where God tests His people to refine and strengthen their faith, as seen in the story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22) and in the trials faced by Job.<p><b>in order to know what was in your heart</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. God&#8217;s testing was designed to reveal the true nature of the Israelites' devotion and commitment to Him. This introspection is vital for believers, as Jesus taught that the greatest commandment is to love God with all one's heart (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><b>whether or not you would keep His commandments</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments was a central theme in the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The wilderness period was a proving ground for their faithfulness to God's laws. This call to obedience is reiterated in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping His commandments as a demonstration of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who led the Israelites through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A significant place of testing and spiritual formation for the Israelites, representing both physical and spiritual challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicated God's laws and guidance to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_forty_years.htm">The Forty Years</a></b><br>A period of testing and preparation for entering the Promised Land, symbolizing a generation's journey of faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_guidance_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Guidance and Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God leads us through life's wilderness experiences with purpose and intention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_testing.htm">The Purpose of Testing</a></b><br>Understand that trials are opportunities for spiritual growth and reveal the true condition of our hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_dependence.htm">Humility and Dependence</a></b><br>Embrace humility and dependence on God as essential attitudes for spiritual maturity and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commandments.htm">Obedience to God's Commandments</a></b><br>Commit to keeping God's commandments as a demonstration of love and faithfulness to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_faithfulness.htm">Remembering God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Regularly recall and give thanks for God's past faithfulness as a source of encouragement and strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_8_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 8:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Remember_God_s_guidance_in_our_trials.htm">How can we remember God's guidance during our own "wilderness" experiences today?

The details of the actual journey are of course included, but only as incidents of "the way." In the Acts of the Apostles the Christian life is in several passages called "the way." In all these things the Israelites were types of us.<p><span class= "bld">To humble thee, and to prove thee.</span>--The way in itself is described as "three days' journey into the wilderness," so far as the leading to Sinai is concerned (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm" title="And they shall listen to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.">Exodus 3:18</a>), and "eleven days' journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea" (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-2.htm" title="(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.)">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>). It was in the power of Jehovah to bring Israel from Egypt to Canaan, had He so willed it, without delay, in a very little time. And just so with "the way" of salvation. There is no intrinsic or necessary impossibility in the <span class= "ital">immediate </span>turning of mankind, or of any individual, from darkness to light. And this change might be followed by immediate removal from "this present evil world" into the place which Christ has gone before to prepare for us. But manifestly the formation of human character by probation and training would vanish in such a process as this. There could be no well-tried and deliberate purpose to serve our Creator and Redeemer in any of us--or, at least, <span class= "ital">no proof </span>of our deliberate preference for His service--under such circumstances. Nor, again, could there be that <span class= "ital">humility </span>which arises only out of self-knowledge. The transitory nature of all mere human resolutions and impressions for good demonstrates to the man who knows himself, better than anything else could do, the power and patience of his Redeemer, and the moral cost of his redemption. This human <span class= "ital">transitoriness </span>and feebleness is strikingly illustrated by the story of the Exodus.<p><span class= "bld">To know what was in thine heart.</span>--"To know" is not simply that <span class= "ital">He </span>might know ("Hell and destruction are before the Lord; how much more then the hearts of the children of men! "), but <span class= "ital">that the knowledge may arise</span>--to <span class= "ital">determine, </span>disclose, discover. So in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm" title="However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.">2Chronicles 32:31</a> : "God left him (Hezekiah) to try him, <span class= "ital">to know </span>all that was in his heart." What God Himself knows by omniscience He sometimes brings to light by evidence for the sake of His creatures. (Comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a> : "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places <span class= "ital">might be known </span>by (by means of) the church the manifold wisdom of God.") . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Remember that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;z&#257;&#183;&#7733;ar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
