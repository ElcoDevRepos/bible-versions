The "cutting off" of nations indicates God's judgment against the Canaanites due to their idolatry and immorality, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>. It underscores the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of nations and fulfills His promises to Israel, as initially given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>.<p><b>whose land He is giving you</b><br>This highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant promise to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give their descendants the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). It emphasizes the concept of the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the inheritance of His people. The land is a gift from God, not earned by Israel's merit, reflecting grace.<p><b>and when you have driven them out</b><br>The driving out of the nations is a command for Israel to act in obedience to God's directive. It involves both divine assistance and human responsibility. This action is part of the holy war concept, where Israel is to be an instrument of God's judgment. It also serves as a warning against the influence of pagan practices, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>, which could lead Israel away from their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and settled in their cities and houses</b><br>This phrase indicates the transition from nomadic life in the wilderness to a settled existence in Canaan. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise of rest and stability for His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). The cities and houses represent the tangible blessings of the covenant, providing security and prosperity. This settlement also foreshadows the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is actively involved in the history and destiny of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being led into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that God is giving to the Israelites, who are to be driven out.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_and_houses.htm">Cities and Houses</a></b><br>The established settlements in the Promised Land that the Israelites will inhabit after driving out the nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is sovereign over nations and history.
