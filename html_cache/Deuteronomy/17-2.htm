The penalty there is directed against the teachers of idolatry, whether prophets, private individuals, or communities in Israel. Here the penalty of death is enacted for every individual, man or woman, found guilty of worshipping any other god but Jehovah. We find traces of this law in the covenant made in the reign of Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-13.htm" title="That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.">2Chronicles 15:13</a>), "that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, <span class= "ital">whether man or woman.</span><p>(3) <span class= "bld">Either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven.</span>--The oldest and simplest, and apparently most innocent form of idolatry.

There is really no such thing as wickedness in the world apart from some wicked being or person.
