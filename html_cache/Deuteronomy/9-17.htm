These tablets symbolize God's covenant with Israel, representing His law and divine will. The act of taking the tablets signifies Moses' role as the mediator between God and the Israelites, entrusted with conveying God's commandments to His people.<p><b>and threw them out of my hands</b><br>Moses' action of throwing the tablets is a dramatic response to the Israelites' sin of idolatry with the golden calf. This act symbolizes the breaking of the covenant due to the people's disobedience. It reflects Moses' righteous indignation and serves as a physical manifestation of the spiritual breach between God and Israel. This moment underscores the seriousness of sin and the consequences of turning away from God's commands.<p><b>shattering them before your eyes</b><br>The shattering of the tablets before the Israelites is a powerful visual demonstration of the broken covenant. It serves as a public rebuke and a call to repentance. This act foreshadows the need for a new covenant, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity. The shattering also emphasizes the gravity of idolatry and the need for the people to return to faithfulness and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai.

When we remember the effect of hastily touching <span class= "ital">not the tables of the Law themselves, but the mere chest that contained them, </span>in after-times, we may well believe that the breaking of these two tables was an act necessary for the safety of Israel. In <a href="/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7</a>, we read that Moses placed the temporary tabernacle outside the camp at the same time.
