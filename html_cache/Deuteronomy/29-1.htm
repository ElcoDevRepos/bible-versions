Covenants in the Bible often include stipulations, blessings, and curses. This particular covenant is a renewal and expansion of the one given at Sinai, emphasizing the continuity of God's promises and expectations.<p><b>that the LORD commanded Moses</b><br>Moses acts as the mediator between God and the Israelites, a role that foreshadows Christ as the ultimate mediator of the New Covenant. The authority of the covenant comes directly from the LORD, underscoring its divine origin and the seriousness with which it should be regarded.<p><b>to make with the Israelites</b><br>The covenant is specifically with the Israelites, God's chosen people, highlighting their unique relationship with Him. This relationship is based on God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it sets the stage for Israel's role in redemptive history.<p><b>in the land of Moab</b><br>Moab is located east of the Jordan River, just outside the Promised Land. This geographical detail is significant as it marks a transitional moment for the Israelites, who are on the brink of entering Canaan. The setting underscores the anticipation and preparation for a new chapter in their history.<p><b>in addition to the covenant He had made with them at Horeb</b><br>Horeb, another name for Mount Sinai, is where the original covenant was given, including the Ten Commandments. This phrase indicates that the covenant in Moab is not a replacement but an addition, reinforcing and expanding upon the earlier covenant. It reflects God's ongoing commitment to His people and His desire for their faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God of Israel, who establishes His laws and promises with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet of Israel, who acts as the mediator of God's covenant with the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recipients of the covenant, who are called to obey and follow God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_moab.htm">The Land of Moab</a></b><br>The geographical location where this covenant is reiterated, east of the Jordan River, just before entering the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/horeb.htm">Horeb (Sinai)</a></b><br>The mountain where the original covenant, including the Ten Commandments, was given to Moses and the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal.htm">Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>The renewal of the covenant in Moab signifies God's ongoing commitment to His people and their need to continually reaffirm their commitment to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_faithfulness.htm">Obedience and Faithfulness</a></b><br>The Israelites are reminded of their responsibility to obey God's commandments as a response to His faithfulness and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context_and_continuity.htm">Historical Context and Continuity</a></b><br>Understanding the historical context of the covenant at Moab helps us see the continuity of God's plan from Sinai to the Promised Land and beyond.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_nature.htm">God's Unchanging Nature</a></b><br>The consistency of God's covenants throughout Scripture reflects His unchanging nature and His desire for a relationship with His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_to_modern_believers.htm">Application to Modern Believers</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to renew their covenant with God, modern believers are encouraged to regularly renew their commitment to Christ and His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_29_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 29:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_29_1_on_covenant_renewal_s_importance.htm">How does Deuteronomy 29:1 emphasize the importance of covenant renewal with God?

But they cannot be right in so doing. For though the pronoun "these" in Hebrew has nothing to determine whether it belongs to what precedes or to what follows, yet the context shows that the covenant is described in Deuteronomy 29, not in Deuteronomy 28 (See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/29-12.htm" title="That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:">Deuteronomy 29:12-15</a> below). It is very significant that this "covenant in the land of Moab" <span class= "ital">stands outside </span>the tremendous sanction appended to the expansion of the Sinaitic covenant in Deuteronomy. The effect of this arrangement may be illustrated by a reference to Leviticus 26, 27. The "sanction" of the law in Leviticus, which is a complete code of ceremonial and moral holiness, is contained in Deuteronomy 26. But that chapter is followed by a passage respecting vows, which are not compulsory, and therefore obviously lie, as a whole, outside that which is "commanded." The position of Deuteronomy 29, 30 is analogous to that of Leviticus 27. Thus we see that the tremendous curse of the Sinaitic covenant <span class= "ital">is not the end of God's dealings with the chosen people. </span>After that, there is still another covenant, to the force of which there is no limit (see <a href="/deuteronomy/29-15.htm" title="But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:">Deuteronomy 29:15</a> below). The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable. Nothing can destroy the relation between Jehovah and Israel. Their resurrection as a nation may well be described by the words of Moses in Psalms 90, "Thou turnest man to destruction (national death--Deuteronomy 28), and sayest (Deuteronomy 29, 30), <span class= "ital">Return, </span>ye children of men (resurrection). <span class= "ital">For </span>a thousand years in thy sight (though spent in the grave) are but as yesterday when it is past, and as <span class= "ital">a watch in the night</span>" (to be followed by the dawn of morning). "A watch in the night" is not the blackness of darkness for ever.<p><span class= "bld">Beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.</span>--It should be carefully noted that the formal repetition of the law in Moses' second great discourse in this book opens with these words (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-2.htm" title="The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>), "the <span class= "ital">Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb." </span>There is no real break in Deuteronomy from <a href="/deuteronomy/5-1.htm" title="And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and keep, and do them.">Deuteronomy 5:1</a> to the end of Deuteronomy 26 and Deuteronomy 27, 28 are the "sanction" of that covenant. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</span> This was not a new covenant in addition to that made at Sinai, but simply a renewal and reaffirmation of that covenant.
