Joshua's lineage is significant as he comes from the tribe of Ephraim, one of the tribes of Israel. His role as a leader is prefigured in earlier texts, such as his role as a military commander in <a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-14</a> and as one of the two faithful spies in <a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>. Joshua's name, meaning "The LORD is salvation," is a type of Jesus Christ, whose name in Hebrew is Yeshua, the same as Joshua.<p><b>was filled with the spirit of wisdom</b><br>The "spirit of wisdom" indicates divine enablement for leadership and decision-making. This wisdom is not merely human insight but a gift from God, as seen in other leaders like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The wisdom given to Joshua is essential for guiding the Israelites into the Promised Land, reflecting the need for spiritual discernment in leadership.<p><b>because Moses had laid his hands on him</b><br>The laying on of hands is a significant act of ordination and blessing, symbolizing the transfer of authority and the impartation of the Holy Spirit. This practice is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the ordination of the Levites (<a href="/numbers/8-10.htm">Numbers 8:10</a>) and the commissioning of church leaders in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>). Moses' act signifies God's choice and approval of Joshua as the new leader.<p><b>So the Israelites obeyed him</b><br>The obedience of the Israelites to Joshua marks a pivotal moment of transition and continuity in leadership. This obedience is crucial for the success of their conquest of Canaan. It reflects the importance of unity and submission to God-appointed leadership, as emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>.<p><b>and did as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the continuity of God's covenant and commandments given through Moses. The Israelites' adherence to these commands is vital for their identity and success as God's chosen people. It also highlights the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises, as seen in the overarching narrative of Scripture from Genesis to Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_son_of_nun.htm">Joshua son of Nun</a></b><br>Joshua is the successor of Moses, chosen to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land.

By naming him &#8220;son of Nun,&#8221; Scripture grounds his authority in lineage recognized by Israel (compare <a href="/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>). Just as God chose Moses from obscurity (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>), He now elevates Joshua so the nation can see continuity in leadership (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was filled with the spirit of wisdom</b><p>This &#8220;spirit of wisdom&#8221; is God&#8217;s own enabling, not mere human aptitude.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a> speaks of Bezalel being &#8220;filled with the Spirit of God, with wisdom.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> promises Messiah will rest under &#8220;the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> assures believers, &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God.&#8221;<p>Joshua&#8217;s wisdom would guide military strategy (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>), covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30&#8211;35</a>), and tribal allotments (<a href="/bsb/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14&#8211;21</a>).
