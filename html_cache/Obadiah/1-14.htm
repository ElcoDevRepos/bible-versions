Historically, Edomites were known for their strategic control over these routes, which they used to their advantage. The crossroads symbolize a place of decision and opportunity, where Edom chose to act against their kin, the Israelites. This action is condemned as it reflects betrayal and opportunism. The crossroads also serve as a metaphor for moral and spiritual decisions, emphasizing the importance of choosing righteousness over exploitation.<p><b>to cut off their fugitives</b><br>The act of cutting off fugitives indicates a deliberate attempt to prevent escape and ensure capture or death. In the context of the Babylonian invasion of Jerusalem, Edom's actions are seen as a betrayal of their kinship with Israel. This phrase underscores the severity of Edom's sin, as they not only refrained from offering refuge but actively participated in the oppression. Biblically, this act is reminiscent of other instances where God condemns those who harm the vulnerable, such as in <a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11-12</a>, which calls for the rescue of those being led away to death.<p><b>nor deliver up their survivors</b><br>Delivering up survivors implies handing over those who managed to escape the initial destruction. This action is particularly egregious as it involves betrayal and a lack of compassion. Historically, this reflects Edom's alliance with Babylon, prioritizing political gain over familial loyalty. Theologically, it contrasts with the biblical call to protect and aid the oppressed, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, which urges the defense of the fatherless and the widow.<p><b>in the day of their distress</b><br>The "day of their distress" refers to the time of Jerusalem's fall and the suffering of its people. This phrase emphasizes the timing of Edom's actions, highlighting their opportunistic nature. In biblical prophecy, the "day of distress" often signifies a time of divine judgment and testing. Edom's actions during this period are seen as a failure to act justly and mercifully, contrasting with the biblical ideal of supporting those in distress, as exemplified by the Good Samaritan in <a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>.
