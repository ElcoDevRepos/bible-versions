In the ancient Near East, theft was a common occurrence, and thieves typically took only what they could carry. This imagery highlights the severity of Edom's coming destruction, suggesting it will be more thorough than a typical robbery. The Bible often uses the imagery of thieves to describe sudden and unexpected judgment (e.g., <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>).<p><b>if robbers by night&#8212;</b><br>Robbers operating at night implies a sense of stealth and surprise. Nighttime robberies were particularly feared because they were harder to prevent and more disorienting. This phrase emphasizes the unexpected and complete nature of the judgment that will befall Edom. The use of "night" can also symbolize spiritual darkness and moral decline, themes prevalent in prophetic literature.<p><b>oh, how you will be ruined&#8212;</b><br>This exclamation underscores the totality of Edom's destruction. The ruin is not just physical but also moral and spiritual, reflecting the consequences of their pride and hostility towards Israel. The prophetic tone here is one of lament, similar to the lamentations over Jerusalem (<a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>). It serves as a warning to all nations about the dangers of pride and enmity against God's people.<p><b>would they not steal only what they wanted?</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests that even thieves, who are typically indiscriminate, leave behind some possessions. In contrast, Edom's destruction will be so complete that nothing will be left. This highlights the thoroughness of divine judgment compared to human actions. It also reflects the biblical principle that God's judgment is both just and comprehensive (<a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9-10</a>).<p><b>If grape gatherers came to you,</b><br>The imagery shifts to grape gatherers, who were known to leave some grapes behind for the poor and for gleaning, as prescribed in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>). This practice ensured that the needy could find sustenance, reflecting God's provision and mercy. The mention of grape gatherers contrasts human mercy with the severity of divine judgment.<p><b>would they not leave some gleanings?</b><br>This question reinforces the idea that human actions, even when destructive, are not as complete as divine judgment. Gleanings were the remnants left for the poor, symbolizing mercy and provision. The absence of gleanings in Edom's case signifies the totality of their judgment, as nothing will be spared. This serves as a stark warning of the consequences of pride and opposition to God's will, as seen in Edom's history of conflict with Israel (<a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>, <a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering a message of judgment against Edom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thieves_and_robbers.htm">Thieves and Robbers</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the complete and utter devastation that will come upon Edom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grape_pickers.htm">Grape Pickers</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who harvest, yet leave some behind, contrasting with the total destruction prophesied for Edom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often in conflict with Edom, representing God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's judgment is thorough and complete.

The Lord, however, will see to it that Edom is stripped of everything&#8212;possessions, power, and pride&#8212;because of its longstanding hostility toward His people. The verse assures believers that God&#8217;s justice is thorough and certain, and no earthly security can stand when He rises to judge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/obadiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5-9) The completeness of the overthrow awaiting Edom. It is no mere inroad of a marauding tribe. Something would escape the <span class= "ital">robber,</span> though he might go away quite satisfied with his plunder; and even a raid in vintage time, for the purpose of doing all the mischief possible to the country, would leave here and there a scattered bunch, gleanings for the inhabitants when the spoilers had retired, but now everything is doomed to destruction. Edom is completely robbed and ransacked. Notice how the sad, almost pathetic, conviction of this breaks out--as if rather from a friend (<span class= "ital">see</span> Introduction) than an enemy--in the parenthetical "how art thou cut off!" in the very middle of the sentence. Every one must perceive, the prophet seems to say, a higher hand at work here.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Some grapes.--</span><span class= "ital">Gleanings,</span> as in margin.

The members of the confederacy are not specified.

The two former would be the natural allies of Edom, and in <a href="/ezekiel/25-8.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like to all the heathen;">Ezekiel 25:8</a> Seir is joined with Moab as reproaching Israel.

The expression "have brought thee to the border" is variously understood.
