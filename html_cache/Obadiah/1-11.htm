Historically, Edom and Israel were related nations, descending from Esau and Jacob, respectively. The Edomites' failure to assist their kin during a time of crisis is a central theme in Obadiah. This reflects a broader biblical principle of accountability for those who fail to act justly or compassionately when they have the opportunity (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p><b>while strangers carried off his wealth</b><br>The "strangers" likely refer to the Babylonians, who invaded Jerusalem and plundered its treasures. This event is part of the larger narrative of the Babylonian conquest, which is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24-25</a>. The looting of Jerusalem's wealth symbolizes the loss of God's blessing and protection due to the nation's disobedience.<p><b>and foreigners entered his gate</b><br>The "foreigners" entering the gates of Jerusalem signifies the breach of the city's defenses and the subsequent occupation by enemy forces. Gates in ancient cities were crucial for defense and commerce, and their capture marked a significant defeat. This imagery is used throughout the Old Testament to depict vulnerability and judgment (<a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>).<p><b>and cast lots for Jerusalem</b><br>Casting lots was a method used in ancient times to make decisions or divide spoils. In this context, it underscores the complete subjugation and humiliation of Jerusalem, as its fate was left to chance by its conquerors. This act of casting lots is reminiscent of the Roman soldiers casting lots for Jesus' garments at the crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>), symbolizing the ultimate degradation and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>you were just like one of them</b><br>Edom's behavior is equated with that of the invaders, despite their kinship with Israel. This condemnation highlights the betrayal and moral failure of Edom, aligning them with the enemies of God's people. The Bible frequently warns against aligning with the wicked (<a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>), and Edom's actions serve as a cautionary tale of the consequences of such alliances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>Descendants of Esau, brother of Jacob (Israel).
