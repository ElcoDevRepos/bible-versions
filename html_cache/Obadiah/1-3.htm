Pride is a recurring theme in Scripture, often leading to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The Edomites, descendants of Esau, were known for their animosity towards Israel, and their pride blinded them to their impending judgment. This serves as a warning against self-reliance and the dangers of pride, which can lead to spiritual deception.<p><b>O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks</b><br>The Edomites lived in a mountainous region, specifically in the area of Mount Seir, which provided natural fortifications. Archaeological evidence shows that their cities, such as Petra, were carved into rock faces, offering them a sense of security. This geographical advantage contributed to their false sense of invincibility, as they believed their location made them impervious to attack.<p><b>whose habitation is the heights</b><br>The Edomites' elevated dwellings symbolized their elevated view of themselves. Living in the heights not only refers to their physical location but also to their lofty self-perception. This imagery is used throughout the Bible to depict those who exalt themselves (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>). The Edomites' trust in their strategic position reflects a broader biblical theme of misplaced trust in human strength rather than in God.<p><b>who say in your heart, &#8216;Who can bring me down to the ground?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the Edomites' overconfidence and defiance. It echoes the attitude of other nations and individuals in the Bible who believed themselves beyond the reach of divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8-11</a>). The phrase underscores the futility of human pride in the face of God's sovereignty. It also foreshadows the ultimate humbling of all who oppose God's will, pointing to the eschatological theme of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>The descendants of Esau, brother of Jacob, who lived in the region of Edom.

The country inhabited by the Edomites lay on the eastern side of the Arabah, and extended from the south end of the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf. It was a region of mountain and valley, difficult, and in many parts inaccessible from the west. Rock-hewn dwellings are found everywhere in those hills, the Edomites, when they expelled the aboriginal Troglodytes (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12, 22</a>), having adopted their habitations and excavated new ones on the same model throughout the whole district. These were useful, not only as being secure from hostile attack, but as cool retreats in the summer of that scorching tract, and offering a warm shelter in winter when fuel was scarce. Petra, the capital, lay completely hidden at the end of a rocky defile some two miles long, and could easily be defended against an enemy by a handful of men. (For a description of this remarkable place, see the Introduction, &sect; I.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle.</span> The Hebrew gives "nest" as the subject of both clauses, thus: "Though thou exaltest... and settest thy nest."
