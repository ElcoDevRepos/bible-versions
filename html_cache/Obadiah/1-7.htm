Historically, Edom was situated south of the Kingdom of Judah and had alliances with neighboring nations. The prophecy indicates that these allies, once trusted, would turn against Edom, forcing them to the borders of their own land. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the unreliability of human alliances compared to the faithfulness of God (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>). The driving to the border symbolizes a complete rejection and expulsion, reminiscent of how Israel's enemies often sought to push them out of their land.<p><b>the men at peace with you will deceive and overpower you.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the theme of treachery. Edom's supposed friends, those with whom they had peaceful relations, would betray them. This deception is a common motif in the Bible, where trust in human strength and alliances often leads to downfall (<a href="/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4-6</a>). The overpowering suggests a sudden and unexpected attack, highlighting the vulnerability of Edom despite their perceived security. This can be seen as a warning against placing trust in worldly peace rather than in God.<p><b>Those who eat your bread will set a trap for you</b><br>Eating bread together in ancient Near Eastern culture was a sign of friendship and covenant. This phrase indicates a deep betrayal, as those who shared in Edom's hospitality would turn against them. This act of treachery is akin to Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, where one who shared the table with Him ultimately set a trap (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>). The imagery of setting a trap suggests a premeditated and cunning plan to bring about Edom's downfall.<p><b>without your awareness of it.</b><br>The final phrase emphasizes the complete surprise and unawareness of Edom regarding the impending betrayal. This lack of awareness can be seen as a result of pride and overconfidence, a recurring theme in Obadiah's prophecy against Edom. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and the importance of vigilance, echoing the New Testament's call to be watchful (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The unexpected nature of the betrayal highlights the futility of relying on human wisdom and alliances over divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often at odds with Israel.

Their supposed friends literally shove them to the edge of their own land, echoing how Babylon later forced Judah into exile (<a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns against relying on human strength: &#8220;It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>). Edom ignored that counsel, and the alliances they prized became the very tool of their ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the men at peace with you will deceive and overpower you</b><p>Peace treaties gave Edom a sense of invincibility, yet God reveals the trap beneath the handshake.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). What David described personally, Edom experienced nationally.<p>&#8226; Deception precedes domination. Once confidence is gained, betrayal comes swiftly&#8212;paralleling Samson&#8217;s fall after Delilah coaxed out his secret (<a href="/judges/16-18.htm">Judges 16:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning reaches beyond Edom. When believers trust culture, politics, or economics more than the living God, they set themselves up for the same surprise reversal (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who eat your bread will set a trap for you without your awareness of it</b><p>Sharing bread signified covenant loyalty; turning on a table-companion was treachery of the deepest kind.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>), a verse Jesus applied to Judas in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>. Edom suffered the same kind of betrayal.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;trap&#8221; suggests a concealed snare&#8212;nothing accidental, but carefully plotted. Edom, confident in its mountain strongholds (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a>), never saw it coming.<p>&#8226; Betrayal by insiders foreshadows the final Antichrist&#8217;s deceit, lulling many with promises of peace before unleashing destruction (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). God&#8217;s people are called to spiritual alertness, &#8220;for we are not ignorant of his schemes&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a> shows God stripping away every false security Edom cherished&#8212;political alliances, peace pacts, even the intimacy of shared meals.

He alone is faithful; all other ground is sinking sand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In this dire calamity Eden shall be deserted by her friends and allies - a punishment for her behaviour to her sister Judah. <span class="cmt_word">The men of thy confederacy.</span> The LXX. and the Vulgate annex these words to the following clause. The allies intended may be Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, who joined together to resist Nebuchadnezzar, and were smitten by him (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>); or, as Perowne thinks, the Chaldeans themselves, who, though the Edomites had aided in the attack on Jerusalem, afterwards turned against them.

It is easier to understand the passage in this way - Thy very allies have assisted the enemy in ex-polling thee from thy borders, and refusing to receive fugitives who came to them. The men that were at peace with thee. Either the same as "the men of thy confederacy," or the neighbouring Arabian tribes who resorted to Petra for commercial reasons (comp. <a href="/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>). The phrase here, literally, <span class="accented">the men of thy peace</span>, is found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and Jot. 38:22.

The expression (comp. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>) implies the closest friendship, especially in Eastern lands, where such a tie is of general obligation. <span class="cmt_word">Have laid a wound under thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">lay a snare under thee</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "they set snares under thee;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ponent insidias subter te</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22</a>). Another interpretation is this: "As thy bread (which they as friends were bound to offer) they lay a sling under thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prepare an ambush for thee, like Jael did for Sisera. Pusey notes the climax in this verse - not confederates only, but friends; not friends only, but familiar friends, indebted to them. Those banded with them should expel them from their country; those at peace should prevail against them in war; those who ate their bread should requite them with treachery. There is none understanding in him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Edom. The shock of this defection of allies and the sudden destruction that has overwhelmed them have deprived the Edomites of their wonted sagacity and prudence. They know not whither to turn or what to do. The following verse expands this thought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/obadiah/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_582.htm">Strong's 582: </a> </span><span class="str2">Man, mankind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">allied with you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1428;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
