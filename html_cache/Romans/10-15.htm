In the early church, apostles and evangelists were often sent by the Holy Spirit or through the laying on of hands by church leaders (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>). The concept of being "sent" is rooted in the Old Testament, where prophets were called and sent by God to deliver His messages (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). The Greek word for "sent" (apostell&#333;) is the root of the term "apostle," indicating a messenger with a specific mission. This underscores the importance of authority and purpose in the proclamation of the Gospel.<p><b>As it is written:</b><br>This phrase introduces a quotation from the Old Testament, a common practice in Paul's writings to validate his teachings with Scripture. Paul often uses the phrase "as it is written" to connect his message with the Jewish Scriptures, showing continuity between the Old and New Testaments. This method also demonstrates the fulfillment of prophecy and the consistency of God's plan throughout history.<p><b>&#8220;How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!&#8221;</b><br>This quotation is from <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, which originally celebrated the return of the exiles to Jerusalem and the proclamation of peace and salvation. In the New Testament context, it is applied to the messengers of the Gospel. The imagery of "beautiful feet" highlights the honor and value of those who carry the message of salvation. In ancient times, messengers traveled long distances on foot, often through difficult terrain, to deliver important news. The "good news" refers to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which brings spiritual liberation and peace with God. This phrase also typologically points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate bearer of good news, who proclaimed the Kingdom of God and brought salvation through His life, death, and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome, addressing both Jewish and Gentile Christians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of a diverse group of believers in Rome, facing challenges of unity and understanding of the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah_the_prophet.htm">Isaiah the Prophet</a></b><br>Paul quotes from <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, highlighting the prophetic tradition of proclaiming God's message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers_of_the_gospel.htm">Messengers of the Gospel</a></b><br>Those who are called and sent to preach the Gospel, fulfilling the Great Commission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_news.htm">The Good News</a></b><br>The message of salvation through Jesus Christ, central to Christian faith and the mission of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_sending.htm">The Necessity of Sending</a></b><br>The Gospel cannot be preached unless individuals are sent.

In Christ that promise reaches its fullest meaning, because the &#8220;good news&#8221; now declares freedom from sin and peace with God (<a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;feet&#8221; are singled out because they carry the messenger across mountain ridges and dusty roads; what ordinarily seems ordinary or unattractive becomes precious when it brings life-changing news.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a> echoes the same picture, and <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a> shows heaven&#8217;s delight when angels proclaimed, &#8220;good news of great joy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every believer who shares Christ participates in that beauty. Paul links gospel readiness with footwear: &#8220;and with your feet fitted with the readiness of the gospel of peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-15.htm">Ephesians 6:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The value of the messenger is measured by the value of the message. Because the gospel is priceless, the one who carries it is esteemed in God&#8217;s sight, and should be in ours as well (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; We honor such messengers by:<p>&#8211; Welcoming them, as Lydia did for Paul (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Caring for their needs, as the Philippians did (<a href="/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Imitating their faith, as early believers were urged to do (<a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a> teaches that effective gospel proclamation depends on divine commissioning and human cooperation.
