In the early church, there was a mix of Jewish and Gentile believers, each bringing different backgrounds and practices. The "weak" in faith often refers to those who are more scrupulous about dietary laws or special days, possibly due to their Jewish heritage or a lack of understanding of Christian liberty. This call to acceptance reflects the broader biblical theme of unity within the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9-13</a>, where Paul discusses the importance of not causing a weaker brother to stumble.<p><b>without passing judgment on his opinions</b><br>This part of the verse instructs believers not to judge or criticize others for their personal convictions, especially in disputable matters. The early church faced various debates over issues such as food offered to idols, observance of holy days, and other cultural practices. <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14:1</a> encourages believers to focus on the essentials of the faith and to show grace in areas where Scripture allows for personal freedom. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a> about not judging others and the call to love one another as seen in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>.

Where the "eye is single"--where all the powers and faculties of the man are concentrated upon one object, and that object the highest that can engage human thought or affection--there will naturally be a certain largeness of view. The opposite of this is to be "weak in the faith." There may be a sincere desire to lead a religious life, and yet the mind is taken up with petty details, each of which is painfully judged by itself, and not by reference to a central principle.<p><span class= "bld">Receive ye.</span>--Take to yourselves, stretch out the hand of friendship to him.<p><span class= "bld">Doubtful disputations.</span>--The marginal rendering is more exact, "to judge his doubtful thoughts," or "to criticise his scruples."

He has already (<a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>) admonished his readers to be "of the same mind one toward another;" but, as was remarked under that verse, this did not imply agreement of view on all subjects, such as is impossible where there are many minds. In this chapter he recognizes the impossibility, having immediately before him what was then patent, the inability of some, through prejudice or slowness of conception, to enter into views of the meaning of the gospel which to himself and the more enlightened were apparent. He by no means departs from what he says elsewhere (cf. <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-10</a>) about no denial of fundamental doctrine being allowable in the communion of the Church; but in matters not touching the foundation he does here inculcate a large and generous tolerance. In these, as in all other relations between men on the earth together, the all-inspiring principle of <span class="accented">charity</span> is to rule. Who the "weak brethren" were whose scruples he especially inculcates tolerance of in this chapter cannot be decided positively. It will he seen that they were persons who thought it their duty to abstain from animal food, and perhaps also from wine (vers. 2, 21); and there is allusion also to observance of certain days (ver. 5). The views that have been taken are as follows: - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That they were the same class of Jewish Christians as are spoken of in <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. as over-scrupulous about eating of things that had been offered in sacrifice to idols. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That they were such as were scrupulous in avoiding unclean meats, forbidden in the Mosaic Law.
