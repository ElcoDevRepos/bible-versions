The term "enemies" indicates their opposition to the message of salvation through Christ, which was a source of tension between Jewish and Gentile believers. Historically, this opposition can be traced back to the early church's struggles, as seen in Acts, where Jewish leaders often resisted the apostles' teachings. The phrase "on your account" suggests that this enmity serves a purpose in God's plan, allowing the gospel to be spread to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>, where Paul and Barnabas turn to the Gentiles after Jewish rejection.<p><b>but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.</b><br>Despite their current opposition to the gospel, the Jewish people remain "loved" because of God's covenantal promises to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This reflects the unchanging nature of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, where God promises to make Abraham a great nation and bless all families of the earth through him. The concept of "election" here emphasizes God's sovereign choice and faithfulness to His covenant, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. This love is not based on their current actions but on God's historical promises and His plan for redemption, which includes the eventual restoration of Israel, as prophesied in passages like <a

they set themselves at odds with God&#8217;s saving work (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on your account</b><p>&#8226; The phrase clarifies why Israel&#8217;s

href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; God used their resistance to open a doorway of mercy to the nations (<a href="/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers from
