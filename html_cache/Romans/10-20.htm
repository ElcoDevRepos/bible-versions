Isaiah's prophecies often challenged the status quo and called Israel to repentance. The boldness here highlights the unexpected nature of God's revelation to the Gentiles, which was a radical concept for the Jewish audience of Paul's time. Isaiah's prophecies are frequently cited in the New Testament, underscoring their importance in understanding the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ.<p><b>&#8220;I was found by those who did not seek Me;</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the surprising nature of God's grace. The Gentiles, who were not actively seeking the God of Israel, found Him through the message of the Gospel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's initiative in salvation, as seen in parables like the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>) and the calling of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). It underscores the idea that God's grace is not limited by human expectations or efforts.<p><b>I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's self-revelation. The Gentiles, who were not part of the covenant community and did not ask for God, received His revelation through Jesus Christ. This aligns with the New Testament theme of the mystery of the Gospel being revealed to all nations (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecies that God's salvation would extend beyond Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God promises to make His servant a light to the nations. This revelation is a testament to God's sovereignty and the inclusivity of His salvation plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah and the salvation of the Gentiles.

God allowed Himself to be discovered by people who were not actively pursuing Him.<p>&#8226; This points to Gentiles&#8212;people outside Israel&#8217;s covenant&#8212;who had no prophetic promises in hand yet came to faith when the gospel reached them (<a href="/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Grace takes the initiative. The risen Christ stepped into the lives of the spiritually uninterested, just as He shone &#8220;on those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today can trace their own stories to this same initiative, for once we were &#8220;without hope and without God in the world,&#8221; yet we were &#8220;brought near by the blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.</b><p>The verse progresses from being &#8220;found&#8221; to God actively &#8220;revealing&#8221; Himself. He did not simply wait to be discovered; He uncovered His character and salvation plan.<p>&#8226; Through the preaching of Paul and the other apostles, the Lord disclosed mysteries &#8220;kept hidden for ages&#8221; but now &#8220;revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22&#8211;31</a> illustrates this revelation: in Athens, a city full of idols, God announced Himself to people who had not requested a divine visit.<p>&#8226; The result is a new people of God: &#8220;Once you were not a people, but now you are God&#8217;s people&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>), confirming that salvation rests on God&#8217;s self-disclosure, not on human initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a> celebrates God&#8217;s sovereign grace. Isaiah had foretold that the Lord would be discovered by those outside Israel&#8217;s covenant and would unveil Himself to people who never thought to seek Him. Paul applies that prophecy to the explosive spread of the gospel among Gentiles. The verse affirms:<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s accuracy&#8212;what Isaiah predicted is literally fulfilled in Christ.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s initiative&#8212;He pursues, finds, and reveals Himself to the undeserving.<p>&#8226; The wideness of mercy&#8212;the blessings promised to Israel overflow to the nations.<p>This truth reassures every believer: our salvation rests not on our own search but on the God who graciously came looking for us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Is very bold.</span>--Comes forward and tells them the naked truth.<p><span class= "bld">I</span> <span class= "bld">was found.</span>--The original of the quotation referred to the apostate Israel; St. Paul here applies it to the Gentiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Esaias is very hold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</span> (<a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a>).
