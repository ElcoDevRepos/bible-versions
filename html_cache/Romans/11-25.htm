Here, he addresses the Roman believers, emphasizing the importance of understanding God's plan for Israel and the Gentiles. The use of "brothers" indicates a familial bond among believers, highlighting the unity in the body of Christ. This mystery involves God's redemptive plan, which was not fully understood in the Old Testament but is now made clear through the gospel.<p><b>so that you will not be conceited</b><br>Paul warns against pride, a recurring theme in his letters. The Gentile believers in Rome might have been tempted to feel superior to the Jews, given their current acceptance of the gospel. This caution serves as a reminder that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of human merit. Pride can lead to division within the church, and Paul seeks to prevent this by encouraging humility and mutual respect among believers.<p><b>A hardening in part has come to Israel</b><br>The "hardening" refers to a spiritual blindness or insensitivity that has affected Israel, preventing them from recognizing Jesus as the Messiah. This is not a complete or permanent hardening, as Paul emphasizes it is "in part." This concept is rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God speaks of Israel's inability to perceive His message. This hardening serves a purpose in God's plan, allowing the gospel to spread to the Gentiles.<p><b>until the full number of the Gentiles has come in</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine timetable in which the inclusion of the Gentiles is part of God's redemptive plan. The "full number" suggests a predetermined completion, aligning with God's sovereign will. This period of Gentile inclusion is a fulfillment of prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is a light to the nations. It also reflects the Great Commission, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The eventual salvation of Israel is anticipated once this period is fulfilled, pointing to a future reconciliation and unity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, addressing the believers in Rome with a message about God's plan for Israel and the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people, God's chosen nation, who are experiencing a partial hardening in their acceptance of the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are being brought into the faith, fulfilling God's plan of salvation for all nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who are being instructed on the mystery of God's redemptive plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery.htm">The Mystery</a></b><br>A divine truth previously hidden but now revealed, concerning the temporary hardening of Israel and the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's salvation plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_mystery.htm">Understanding the Mystery</a></b><br>Recognize that God's plan includes both Jews and Gentiles, and His ways are often beyond our full understanding.
