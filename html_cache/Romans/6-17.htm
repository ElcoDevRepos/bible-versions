It reflects the biblical theme of thanksgiving found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, where believers are encouraged to give thanks in all circumstances. This gratitude is directed towards God for His grace and mercy in delivering believers from their past condition.<p><b>though you once were slaves to sin</b><br>This phrase highlights the past condition of the believers before their conversion. The concept of being "slaves to sin" is a powerful metaphor illustrating the bondage and control sin had over their lives. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, slavery was a common institution, and this metaphor would resonate deeply with the audience. Biblically, this aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>, where He states that everyone who sins is a slave to sin, emphasizing the need for spiritual liberation.<p><b>you wholeheartedly obeyed</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete and sincere response to the gospel message. The term "wholeheartedly" suggests a transformation that involves the entire being, not just intellectual assent but a deep, genuine commitment. This obedience is a key theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which calls believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers.<p><b>the form of teaching</b><br>This refers to the specific doctrine or set of teachings that the Roman believers received. In the early church, the apostles' teaching was foundational, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early Christians devoted themselves to the apostles' doctrine. This "form of teaching" likely includes the core tenets of the Christian faith, such as the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the call to live a holy life.<p><b>to which you were committed</b><br>This phrase suggests a deliberate and intentional dedication to the teachings they received. The commitment implies a covenantal relationship, similar to the Old Testament covenants where God's people were called to be faithful to His commands. This commitment is echoed in passages like <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13-14</a>, where Paul urges Timothy to hold fast to the pattern of sound teaching and guard the good deposit entrusted to him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, providing theological insights and practical instructions for living a Christian life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, these early Christians were living in a diverse and often challenging environment, facing both internal and external pressures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slavery_to_sin.htm">Slavery to Sin</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to describe the previous state of the believers before accepting Christ, indicating a life controlled by sinful desires.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_from_the_heart.htm">Obedience from the Heart</a></b><br>This phrase highlights the transformation that occurs when believers genuinely commit to the teachings of Christ, moving from external compliance to internal conviction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/form_of_teaching.htm">Form of Teaching</a></b><br>Refers to the apostolic doctrine and the core teachings of Christianity that the Roman believers were taught and committed to following.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_obedience.htm">Transformation through Obedience</a></b><br>True Christian transformation involves a shift from external adherence to internal conviction, where obedience stems from the heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_doctrine.htm">The Power of Doctrine</a></b><br>The "form of teaching" signifies the importance of sound doctrine in shaping a believer's life.

There is no contradiction between what is here said and the fear previously implied lest the persons addressed might still serve sin. He refers them back to the time of their baptism, when he conceives them both to have understood their obligation (cf. ver. 3), and also to have been heartily sincere. The fear was lest they might have relaxed since, perhaps through infection with antinomian teaching. By the "form of doctrine" or "of instruction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is not at all likely to be meant (as some have supposed) any distinctive <span class="accented">type</span> of Christian teaching, such as the <span class="accented">Pauline</span> (so Meyer). Usually elsewhere, where St. Paul uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it is of persons being examples or patterns to others (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>).
