This question reflects the tension between the Jewish and Gentile believers in the early church. Historically, Israel was chosen as God's covenant people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). The question implies a deep theological inquiry into God's promises and their fulfillment. The context of <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a> deals with the mystery of Israel's partial hardening and the inclusion of the Gentiles.<p><b>Certainly not!</b><br>Paul emphatically denies the idea that God has rejected Israel. This strong negation underscores the continuity of God's covenant promises. The phrase echoes the assurance found in <a href="/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>, where God promises not to forsake His people for His great name's sake. It affirms God's unchanging nature and His faithfulness to His word.<p><b>I am an Israelite myself,</b><br>Paul uses his own identity as evidence of God's ongoing relationship with Israel. As a Jew, he represents the remnant chosen by grace (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). This personal testimony highlights the fact that God has not abandoned His people entirely. Paul's Jewish heritage is significant in establishing his credibility and authority in addressing Jewish concerns.<p><b>a descendant of Abraham,</b><br>By tracing his lineage to Abraham, Paul connects to the patriarchal promises given in Genesis. Abraham is the father of the Jewish nation and the recipient of God's covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This reference emphasizes the continuity of God's promises from Abraham to his descendants, affirming that God's covenantal relationship with Israel remains intact.<p><b>from the tribe of Benjamin.</b><br>Paul specifies his tribal affiliation, which is significant in several ways. The tribe of Benjamin was one of the two tribes that remained loyal to the Davidic kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>). Historically, Benjamin was also the tribe of King Saul, Israel's first king (<a href="/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>).

He answers - No; impossible! God's ancient covenant with his people stands; the remnant of believers even now is a sign of his continued favour to his ancient people, as was, in the time of Elijah, the remnant that had not bowed the knee to Baal; nor does the fact of its being a remnant only imply now, any more than then, that the nation as such is cast off; and further, the calling of the Gentiles, far from being intended to exclude God's ancient people, will be the means eventually of bringing it wholly in. Such is the apostle's prophetic vision of the future, in view of which he bursts at the end of the chapter into glowing admiration of the inscrutable ways of God. In the course of it also (vers. 17-25) he introduces a warning to Gentile believers not to pride themselves against the Jews because of present preference to them, or to regard their own position of privilege as indefeasible. It must still be borne in mind that it is the position before God of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> that is all along in view. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say then, Hath God east away his people!

The usual interpretation of this whole passage, and notably that of the ancients, has been to take the proof of God not having cast off his people as beginning in ver. 1, with "for I also," etc., and all the rest to be in sequence. Chrysostom's explanation of the argument is to the following effect: God has not rejected his ancient people; for I myself am eminently of it; and I have been selected as a chief proclaimer and expounder of the gospel to the world; this would not have been the case if the nation had been cast off. But it may be said to me," You are only one of the ancient people; you are not the people." Nay, but I do not stand alone; there are thousands of Israelite believers as well as myself; and these are God's true people, the people whom he foreknew. And of them there may be more than we are aware of; it is as it was in the days of Elias; he had supposed himself to be left alone; but he was told that there were seven thousand with him who were God's true people still. And so now, there is a faithful remnant, the number of which is known to God alone, which is his people still, according to the election of grace. The same Father further understands the citation of the whole of the passage from <a href="/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>, though not required for the apostle's proof, to be intended as significant. It would have sufficed, he says, to cite only what was said about a remnant being left; but the whole complaint of Elias is cited, so as to show by the way that the present rejection of Christ and persecution of the Church by the majority of the Jews had also its counterpart in ancient times; and thus the apostle, he says, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the unbelieving Jews) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It is to be observed that the above interpretation of the passage, which in its main points has been most generally adopted, goes on two suppositions; vie. that "for I also<span class="accented"></span>," in ver. 1, is the first part of the proof that Israel is not cast off; and that "which he foreknew," in ver. 2, is intended as a limitation of the meaning of "his people." According to another view, decidedly upheld by Meyer, "for I also" is not part of the proof, but connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>: "I must needs say, God forbid! being myself a Hebrew of the Hebrews" Then, according to this view, comes the positive statement that God has not east off his people in the same general sense as before, after which the proof begins; the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> not being a limitation of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but intended to enforce the idea of the impossibility of the final rejection of the race of Israel (cf. ver. 29; also <a href="/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>). The fact that, throughout the chapter, it is Israel as a nation that is in view, and that the coming of the whole nation into the kingdom of Christ is contemplated in the end, adds decided probability to this view of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, etc., in ver. 1, may still be regarded as possibly part of the proof. St. Paul's designation of himself as "of the seed of Abraham" seems meant to express that he was an Israelite of pure descent, not a proselyte or descended from proselytes. In <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>, as well as here, he specifies his tribe as that of Benjamin, the tribe that with Judah had clung to the house of David, and had shared the privileges of Judah. The quotation from <a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>. is given freely from the LXX., varying a little, but not so as to affect the meaning. One variation is in the feminine, instead of masculine, article before <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span>, which has been explained by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> understood (so in the Authorized Version, "the <span class="accented">image</span> <span class="accented">of</span> Baal "), or by there having been a female Baal, or by the god having been supposed androgynous, or by the feminine being used of idols in contempt. St. Paul may possibly have found this reading in his copy of the LXX. The variation is of no importance with regard to the drift of the passage. "According to the election of grace," at the end of ver. 5, does not seem to be directly suggested by the passage cited, but added by St. Paul so as to make plain his position - maintained throughout the Epistle, and about to be pressed in this chapter on the consideration of Gentile Christians - that the calling of all, whether Jews or Gentiles, is "of grace," and not claimable as of right by any on the ground of the merit of their own works. And in order to enforce this position, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the word "grace" loses its essential meaning. <span class="cmt_word">[But if of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.]</span> The preponderance of ancient authorities is against the retention of the clause within brackets, which does not seem required. It is the same as in <a href="/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I ask</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
