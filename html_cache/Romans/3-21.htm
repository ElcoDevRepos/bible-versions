It contrasts the previous discussion of humanity's universal sinfulness and the inability of the law to bring about righteousness. The "now" indicates a new era in salvation history, inaugurated by the coming of Jesus Christ.<p><b>apart from the law</b><br>This emphasizes that the righteousness of God is revealed independently of the Mosaic Law. The law, while holy and good, was unable to justify humanity. This statement underscores the idea that salvation is not based on adherence to the law but is a gift of grace through faith.<p><b>the righteousness of God</b><br>This refers to God's own righteousness, which He imparts to believers. It is a key theme in Romans, highlighting God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His just nature. This righteousness is not earned but is given through faith in Jesus Christ.<p><b>has been revealed</b><br>The revelation of God's righteousness is made manifest in the person and work of Jesus Christ. This revelation was previously hidden but is now made clear through the gospel. It signifies the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>as attested by the Law and the Prophets</b><br>This phrase indicates that the righteousness of God, though apart from the law, is not contrary to it.

But now, in contrast with the previous state of things, a new system has appeared upon the scene. In this system law is entirely put on one side, though the system itself was anticipated in and is attested by those very writings in which the Law was embodied. Law is now superseded, the great end of the Law, the introduction of righteousness, being accomplished in another way, viz., through faith in Christ, by which a state of righteousness is superinduced upon all believers.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">But now.</span>--In these latter days.

This passage, in which the thesis of <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> is formally enunciated, is consistent with this meaning; in confirmation of which observe vers. 25, 26, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently means God's own righteousness, as also above, ver. 5.

However true these positions may be, what is said here seems simply to mean that God's righteousness has been manifested in Christ in a different way, and on a different principle, from that of law. The principle of law is to enjoin and forbid, and to require complete obedience; but law, even as exhibited in the Divine Law of the Jews, has been shown to fail to enable man thus to attain to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; therefore, apart from this exacting principle, the righteousness of God is now revealed to man, embracing him in itself. The absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> here, and its insertion in the latter clause of the same verse, where the Mosaic Law is definitely referred to, is fully explained by what has been said above under Romans 2:13. <span class="accented">Being witnessed</span>, etc., is introduced parenthetically by way of intimating that this manifestation of God's righteousness, though "apart from law," is not in any opposition to the teaching of the Law and the prophets, being, in fact, anticipated by them. The proof of this appears afterwards in ch. 4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#965;&#957;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Nyni)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3570.htm">Strong's 3570: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of nun for emphasis; just now.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">apart from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ch&#333;ris)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5565.htm">Strong's 5565: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apart from, separately from; without.
