In the broader context of <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, Paul is addressing the issue of God's election and the role of human will. The idea that salvation does not depend on human desire or effort aligns with the doctrine of grace, which is a central theme in Paul's writings. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> reinforces this by stating that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of works, so that no one can boast. This phrase challenges the cultural and religious mindset of first-century Judaism, which often emphasized adherence to the law and personal righteousness as means to achieve favor with God. The historical context of the Roman church, which included both Jewish and Gentile believers, highlights the importance of understanding that salvation is not earned by human means but is a result of divine grace.<p><b>but on God&#8217;s mercy</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the concept of divine mercy as the basis for salvation. Mercy, in biblical terms, refers to God's compassion and forgiveness extended to humanity despite their sinfulness. The Old Testament frequently speaks of God's mercy, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>, where God declares that He will have mercy on whom He chooses. This theme is also evident in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is portrayed as the ultimate expression of God's mercy, offering salvation to all who believe. Theologically, this phrase points to the idea that God's mercy is not something that can be earned or merited; it is freely given according to His sovereign will. This aligns with the prophetic writings, such as those in Isaiah, which speak of God's plan to extend mercy beyond Israel to the Gentiles, fulfilling His promise to bless all nations through Abraham's seed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, explaining the sovereignty of God in salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Central to this verse, God is depicted as the sovereign being whose mercy is the determining factor in salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a> discusses Israel's place in God's redemptive plan, highlighting God's sovereign choice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan of salvation is a key theme in Romans, emphasizing that salvation is not limited by ethnicity or human effort.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, Pharaoh serves as an example of God's sovereign will in hardening hearts to demonstrate His power and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's mercy is the foundation of salvation, not human effort or desire.

The words &#8220;So then&#8221; signal a summary: everything he has said about God&#8217;s freedom in choosing His people funnels into this single, sweeping statement.
