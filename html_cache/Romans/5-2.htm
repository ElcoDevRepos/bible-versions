In the Old Testament, access to God was limited, often requiring a priestly intermediary (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) symbolizes the new direct access believers have to God through Jesus. This access is not based on human merit but on Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>by faith</b><br>Faith is the means by which believers receive God's grace. <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This faith is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Christ's finished work. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> underscores that faith itself is a gift from God, not a result of works.<p><b>into this grace</b><br>Grace refers to the unmerited favor of God. In the context of Romans, it highlights the transition from the law to grace, a central theme in Paul's writings (<a href="/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>). Grace is the foundation of the believer's relationship with God, contrasting with the works-based righteousness of the law. This grace is abundant and sufficient for all needs (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><b>in which we stand</b><br>The phrase indicates a firm and secure position. Standing in grace suggests stability and assurance in the believer's life. This standing is not precarious but is guaranteed by the promises of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1</a>). It reflects the believer's new identity and position in Christ, as opposed to being under condemnation (<a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<p><b>And we rejoice</b><br>Rejoicing is a natural response to the assurance of salvation and the hope believers have in Christ. This joy is not dependent on circumstances but is rooted in the eternal truths of the gospel. <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a> encourages believers to rejoice always, reflecting a life transformed by the Spirit.<p><b>in the hope of the glory of God</b><br>Hope in this context is a confident expectation of future glory. It is not wishful thinking but a certainty based on God's promises. The glory of God refers to the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan, including the believer's glorification (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). This hope sustains believers through trials and is a key theme in eschatological teachings (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome, explaining the theological foundation of the Christian faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The "whom" in the verse refers to Jesus Christ, through whom believers have access to grace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grace.htm">Grace</a></b><br>The unmerited favor of God, which believers access through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_god.htm">The Glory of God</a></b><br>The ultimate hope and future reality for believers, reflecting God's majesty and divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/access_by_faith.htm">Access by Faith</a></b><br>Faith is the key that opens the door to God's grace.

It means the access to the holy God, which had been barred by sin, but which has been opened to us through Christ (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19</a>). It is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is properly taken (as in the Authorized Version) in immediate connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, as denoting that <span class="accented">into</span> which we have our access. In <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a> the word is followed by the more suitable preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the phrase being, "access to the Father;" and this may be understood here, the sense being, "We have through Christ our access (<span class="accented">to the Father</span>) <span class="accented">unto</span> (ie. so as to result in) the state of grace and acceptance in which we now stand." As to "the glory of God," see above on Romans 3:23. Here our hoped-for <span class="accented">future</span> participation in the Divine glory is more distinctly intimated by the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>. This last phrase bears the same sense as in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>, and probably in <a href="/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a> above. It does not mean that hope is that wherein we glory, but that, being in a state of hope, we glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whom</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have gained</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#967;&#942;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(esch&#275;kamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
