The "old self" refers to the pre-conversion nature, characterized by sin and separation from God. The crucifixion with Christ signifies a spiritual union with His death, symbolizing the believer's death to sin. This concept is rooted in the idea of substitutionary atonement, where Christ's death pays the penalty for sin. <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a> echoes this, stating, "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me." The crucifixion metaphor also connects to baptism, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, where believers are buried with Christ in baptism and raised to new life.<p><b>so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless</b><br>The "body of sin" refers to the human nature inclined towards sin, often described as the flesh. The rendering of it powerless indicates a decisive break from sin's dominion. This does not imply sinless perfection but a significant shift in the believer's relationship with sin. The Greek term used here can be understood as "nullified" or "made ineffective," suggesting that sin's control is broken. This aligns with <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9-10</a>, which speaks of putting off the old self and putting on the new self, renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator.<p><b>that we should no longer be slaves to sin</b><br>This phrase highlights the liberation from sin's bondage, a central theme in Paul's writings. In the Roman context, slavery was a familiar institution, and Paul uses it metaphorically to describe the believer's former state under sin's control. The imagery of slavery underscores the totality of sin's dominion before conversion. However, through Christ's redemptive work, believers are set free, as stated in <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>, "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." This freedom is not an autonomy to sin but a call to live in righteousness, as further elaborated in <a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>, where believers become "slaves to righteousness."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the capital of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this passage, Jesus' crucifixion is the event that enables believers to be freed from the power of sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event where Jesus was crucified, which is pivotal in Christian theology as the means by which sin is defeated.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_self.htm">The Old Self</a></b><br>Refers to the sinful nature inherent in humanity before accepting Christ, which is symbolically crucified with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_old_self.htm">Understanding the Old Self</a></b><br>Recognize that the "old self" refers to our pre-Christian identity, dominated by sin.

The Christian's union with the crucified Christ binds him also to crucify or mortify (ascetically) the sinful desires of his body. Thus he is released from the dominion of those desires. But this is not all. Just as Christ passed from the cross to the resurrection, and overcame death once for all, exchanging for it a life wholly dependent upon God; so, too, His followers must consider themselves cut off irrevocably--as if by death itself--from sin, and living with a new life dedicated and devoted to God, through their participation in the death and life of Jesus Christ their Lord.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Our old man.</span>--"Our old self" (Vaughan), as in <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9-10</a>.<p>The old self, or that congeries of evil habits acquired in the state of heathenism, was, ideally if not actually, mortified and killed in our baptism. This change was wrought by a power brought to bear upon the will through the contemplation of the crucifixion of Christ. Hence, instead of saying simply "mortified," the Apostle writes rather "crucified," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span> put to death, not in any way, but specially <span class= "ital">through the cross.</span><p><span class= "bld">That the body of sin might be destroyed.</span>--The "body of sin" is the body subject to sin, or that supplies sin with the material on which it works. This substratum of carnal and fleshly desire, the Apostle tells us, is to be ascetically chastened and disciplined until it ceases to be a source of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing this</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">that our old man was</span> (not <span class="accented">is</span>, as in the Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed</span> (or <span class="accented">abolished</span>, or <span class="accented">done away</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>that</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>henceforth we should not serve</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, expressing <span class="accented">bondage</span>, or <span class="accented">slavery</span>; and so throughout the chapter in the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, translated "servants") <span class="cmt_word">sin.

The term "old man" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs also <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>. It denotes man's unregenerate self, when under sin and condemnation; the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being his regenerate self. It is, of course, a different conception from that of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>. In Ephesians and Colossians the old man is said to be <span class="accented">put away</span>, or <span class="accented">put off</span>, and the new one <span class="accented">put on, as</span> though they were two clothings, or investments, of his personality, determining its character. Here, by a bolder figure, they are viewed as an old self that had died and a new one that had come to life in its place (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The idea of a new man being born into a new life in baptism was already familiar to the Jews in their baptism of proselytes (see Lightfoot, on <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>.); and our Lord, discoursing to Nicodemus of the new birth, supposes him to understand the figure; but he teaches him that the change thus expressed should be no mere change of profession and habits of life, but a radical inward change, which could only be wrought by the regenerating Spirit. Such a change St. Paul teaches to be signified by Christian baptism; not only deliverance from condemnation through participation in the benefits of the death of Christ, but also the birth or creation of a new self corresponding to his risen body, which will not be, like the old self, under the thraldom of sin. "The body of sin" may be taken as meaning much the same as "our old man;" sin being conceived as embodied in our former selves, and so possessing them and keeping them in bondage. It certainly does not mean simply our bodies as distinct from our souls, so as to imply the idea that the former must be macerated that the latter may live. The asceticism inculcated elsewhere in the New Testament is in no contradiction to the ideal of <span class="accented">mens sana in corpore sano.</span> Our former sin-possessed and sin-dominated personality being now crucified with Christ, dead, and done away with, we are no longer, in our new personality, in slavery to sin, and are both bound and able to renounce it; "for he that hath died is freed [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, literally, 'is justified'] from sin." In Scotland, one who is executed is said to be <span class="accented">justified</span>, the idea apparently being that he has satisfied the claims of law. So here ' <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.
