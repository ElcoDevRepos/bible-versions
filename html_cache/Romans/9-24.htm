It highlights the personal nature of God's calling, suggesting that the audience, which includes the Roman Christians, is part of this chosen group. This reflects the broader theme in Romans of God's grace extending beyond ethnic boundaries.<p><b>whom He has called</b><br>The concept of calling is central to Paul's theology, indicating God's sovereign initiative in salvation. This calling is not based on human merit but on God's purpose and grace. It echoes earlier themes in Romans, such as in <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, where those whom God predestined, He also called. This calling is effectual, leading to justification and glorification.<p><b>not only from the Jews</b><br>Paul acknowledges the historical reality that the Jewish people were the initial recipients of God's promises and covenants. This phrase respects the Jewish heritage and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning Israel. It aligns with the idea that salvation is "first for the Jew" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), recognizing their unique role in redemptive history.<p><b>but also from the Gentiles?</b><br>This inclusion of Gentiles is a radical and transformative concept in the early church, breaking down the barriers between Jews and non-Jews. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is a light to the Gentiles. This reflects the universal scope of the gospel and the mystery revealed in Christ, as discussed in <a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>, where Gentiles are fellow heirs and members of the same body.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the church in Rome, which consists of both Jewish and Gentile believers.
