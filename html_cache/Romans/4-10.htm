The context is crucial because it highlights the principle that righteousness comes through faith, not works or adherence to the law. This is a foundational concept in Paul's argument that salvation is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike, through faith in Jesus Christ. The crediting of righteousness to Abraham is first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where Abraham believed God's promise, and it was counted to him as righteousness. This sets a precedent for understanding faith as the means of being justified before God.<p><b>Was it after his circumcision, or before?</b><br>This question addresses the timing of when Abraham was declared righteous. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham, introduced in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>. However, Abraham was declared righteous in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, before the covenant of circumcision was established. This distinction is significant because it underscores that righteousness by faith precedes and is independent of the law or any physical sign. It emphasizes that the promise of righteousness through faith is not limited to those who are circumcised, but is available to all who believe.<p><b>It was not after, but before.</b><br>This statement confirms that Abraham's righteousness was credited before he was circumcised. This order of events is crucial in Paul's argument to the Roman church, as it demonstrates that the Gentiles, who are not circumcised, can also be justified by faith. It reinforces the idea that faith, not adherence to the law or physical rituals, is the basis for righteousness. This principle is echoed in <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7-9</a>, where Paul explains that those who have faith are children of Abraham and are blessed along with him. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God's plan of salvation through faith was always intended for all nations, fulfilling the promise that all peoples on earth will be blessed through Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abraham is considered the father of faith.

That moment is recorded in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&#8221; Paul already quoted it in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6</a>, so he now invites us to look at the setting:<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> comes well before any command to circumcise (<a href="/bsb/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>).<p>&#8226; Nothing but faith is mentioned; Abraham simply trusts God&#8217;s promise about descendants as numerous as the stars.<p>&#8226; The crediting of righteousness is presented as a divine accounting act&#8212;God reckons Abraham righteous on the basis of faith alone.<p>Paul&#8217;s question highlights that salvation&#8217;s foundation is God&#8217;s grace responding to faith, not human ritual or law-keeping.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was it after his circumcision,</b><p>Paul continues, &#8220;Was it after his circumcision&#8230;&#8221; to test any assumption that the physical sign had a role in earning righteousness. Looking at <a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14 and 17</a>:23-24:<p>&#8226; Circumcision is instituted at least thirteen years after <a href="/bsb/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> (cf. <a href="/genesis/16-16.htm">Genesis 16:16</a>; 17:1).<p>&#8226; Abraham is ninety-nine when he receives the sign (<a href="/genesis/17-24.htm">Genesis 17:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The rite is given as a covenant sign, not a means of justification (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>).<p>So, if someone claims righteousness depends on circumcision, the timeline immediately refutes it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or before?</b><p>Paul presses the point: &#8220;or before?&#8221; The answer is obvious from the narrative:<p>&#8226; The crediting of righteousness precedes any work, ceremony, or law (<a href="/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s uncircumcised state makes him the prototype for Gentile believers (<a href="/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise was granted &#8220;while he was still uncircumcised&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>), showing faith alone is sufficient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was not after, but before.</b><p>Paul&#8217;s verdict: &#8220;It was not after, but before.&#8221; Theologically, this settles several truths:<p>&#8226; Circumcision is a &#8220;seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>). The seal attests to something already possessed.<p>&#8226; Salvation is by grace through faith, &#8220;not of works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), so no one can boast.<p>&#8226; Abraham becomes &#8220;the father of all who believe without being circumcised&#8221; and also of the circumcised who share his faith (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; External rituals, whether ancient circumcision or modern ordinances, testify to faith; they do not produce it (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7-11</a>).<p>For every believer, the order matters: faith first, righteousness credited, then outward signs follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/4-10.htm">Romans 4:10</a> dismantles any claim that ritual secures righteousness. By pointing to the timeline of Abraham&#8217;s life, Paul shows that God credited righteousness solely on the basis of faith long before circumcision existed. This confirms that salvation rests on grace through faith alone, opening the door equally to Jew and Gentile and making Abraham the spiritual father of all who trust God as he did.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In what context</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8182;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4459.htm">Strong's 4459: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adverb from the base of pou; an interrogative particle of manner; in what way?; also as exclamation, how much!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was it credited?</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(elogisth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3049.htm">Strong's 3049: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reckon, count, charge with; reason, decide, conclude; think, suppose. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Was it after]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8004;&#957;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(onti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
