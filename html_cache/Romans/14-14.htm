This phrase highlights the authority of Christ in shaping Paul's beliefs. The phrase "in the Lord Jesus" indicates that Paul's understanding is not based on human wisdom but on divine revelation. This reflects the broader New Testament teaching that Christ is the ultimate authority on matters of faith and practice (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). Paul's confidence is reminiscent of his earlier statements in Romans, where he emphasizes living by faith (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>).<p><b>that nothing is unclean in itself</b><br>Here, Paul addresses the issue of ceremonial cleanliness, a significant concern in Jewish law. In the Old Testament, certain foods and practices were deemed unclean (Leviticus 11). However, in the New Covenant, these ceremonial laws are fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>). Paul asserts that, in essence, all creation is good, as God originally declared in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. This statement challenges the Jewish dietary laws and reflects the freedom believers have in Christ, emphasizing that external rituals do not define one's purity before God.<p><b>But if anyone regards something as unclean</b><br>Paul acknowledges the subjective nature of personal convictions. While he is convinced of the inherent cleanness of all things, he recognizes that not all believers share this understanding. This reflects the diverse backgrounds of the early church, which included both Jewish and Gentile believers. The cultural and religious backgrounds of these groups influenced their views on what was considered clean or unclean. Paul&#8217;s approach is pastoral, showing sensitivity to the conscience of weaker believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7-13</a>).<p><b>then for him it is unclean</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of individual conscience in the life of a believer. Paul teaches that if a person believes something to be unclean, then acting against that belief would be sinful for them. This principle is rooted in the broader biblical teaching that faith and conscience are integral to one's relationship with God (<a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>). It highlights the personal nature of faith and the need for believers to act according to their convictions, while also respecting the convictions of others. This approach fosters unity and love within the diverse body of Christ (<a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is addressing the church in Rome, providing guidance on how to handle disputes over dietary laws and practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who were experiencing tension over differing views on dietary restrictions and other cultural practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_jesus.htm">The Lord Jesus</a></b><br>Central to Paul's argument, as Paul is convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is inherently unclean, emphasizing the authority of Christ in matters of conscience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_christian_liberty.htm">Understanding Christian Liberty</a></b><br>Believers have freedom in Christ regarding dietary laws, as nothing is inherently unclean.

For one of his intense penetration and grasp on the realities of things, any other position was impossible. But while these essential features in the Apostle's character find the noblest expression, we cannot but note his attitude of gentle forbearance towards those whose faith is less deep and less robust than his own. This comes out especially in that pathetic and pregnant appeal, "Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died."<p><span class= "bld">By the Lord Jesus.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in the Lord Jesus.</span> A solemn form of asseveration. The Apostle is speaking from the very depths of his Christian consciousness as one who knows that he has himself put on the Spirit of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">To him that esteemeth.</span>--This would mean, in philosophical language, that the quality of uncleanness was not an objective property in the thing itself, but a subjective quality in the mind of the person regarding it as such. Still, this subjective quality is for the individual a real one, and should be treated as real.
