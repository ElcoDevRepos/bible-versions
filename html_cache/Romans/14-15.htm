In the early church, dietary practices were a significant point of contention, particularly between Jewish and Gentile Christians. Jewish Christians adhered to dietary laws from the Old Testament, while Gentile converts did not. The Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of considering the conscience and spiritual well-being of others. This aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9-13</a>, where Paul discusses the responsibility to avoid being a stumbling block to weaker believers.<p><b>you are no longer acting in love</b><br>Love is a central theme in Christian ethics, as seen in Jesus' commandment to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>). Acting in love means prioritizing the spiritual health and unity of the church over personal freedoms. This reflects the sacrificial love of Christ, who put others' needs before His own. The Greek word for love here is "agape," which denotes selfless, unconditional love. This principle is foundational in Christian relationships and community life.<p><b>Do not by your eating destroy your brother</b><br>The term "destroy" here implies causing spiritual ruin or leading someone into sin. Paul warns against using personal liberty in a way that could lead a fellow believer to violate their conscience, potentially damaging their faith. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>, where Jesus warns against causing believers to stumble. The emphasis is on the communal aspect of faith, where individual actions have broader implications for the body of Christ.<p><b>for whom Christ died</b><br>This phrase underscores the immense value of each believer, as they are redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ. It serves as a reminder of the cost of salvation and the unity believers share in Christ's death and resurrection. The sacrificial death of Jesus is central to Christian theology, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>. Recognizing the worth of each believer in the eyes of God should motivate Christians to act with love and consideration, reflecting the sacrificial nature of Christ's love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Christian community in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, facing issues of dietary practices and mutual acceptance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message, emphasizing His sacrificial death for all believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_and_gentile_believers.htm">Jewish and Gentile Believers</a></b><br>The two groups within the Roman church, each with different cultural and religious backgrounds, particularly concerning dietary laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dietary_practices.htm">Dietary Practices</a></b><br>The specific issue being addressed, where differing views on food could cause division within the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acting_in_love.htm">Acting in Love</a></b><br>Our actions should be motivated by love, prioritizing the spiritual well-being of others over personal freedoms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The church is called to embrace diversity in non-essential matters, fostering unity through love and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_others.htm">Responsibility to Others</a></b><br>Believers have a responsibility to avoid actions that could harm the faith of others, recognizing the value of each person for whom Christ died.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_living.htm">Sacrificial Living</a></b><br>Emulate Christ's sacrificial love by willingly setting aside personal rights for the sake of others' spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/conscience_and_freedom.htm">Conscience and Freedom</a></b><br>Exercise Christian freedom with sensitivity to the consciences of others, ensuring that liberty does not become a stumbling block.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_14_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 14:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_15_Love_over_preferences.htm">How does Romans 14:15 guide us in loving fellow believers over personal preferences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_food_impact_others_spirituality.htm">What does "destroy by your food" teach about prioritizing others' spiritual well-being?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Romans_14_15_to_today_s_choices.htm">How can Romans 14:15 be applied to modern-day dietary or lifestyle choices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Romans_14_15_link_to_Jesus_love.htm">In what ways does Romans 14:15 connect to Jesus' teachings on love and sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_grieving_others_feelings.htm">How can we ensure our actions don't "grieve" others, as warned in Romans 14:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_actions_on_believers_faith.htm">How does Romans 14:15 address the impact of our actions on fellow believers' faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_15_Love_over_freedom.htm">What does Romans 14:15 teach about prioritizing love over personal freedom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_15_s_impact_on_Christian_liberty.htm">How does Romans 14:15 challenge our understanding of Christian liberty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_can_food_choices_harm_believers.htm">Romans 14:15 &#8211; How can eating or not eating certain foods truly &#8220;destroy&#8221; another believer, and has this ever been historically evident?

We may suppose that the substance of this verse recurs to the Apostle's mind after the parenthetical statement just inserted, and though he does not repeat it in words, he connects on to it the sequence of his thought. "The Christian should not put a stumbling-block in his brother's way. Not, indeed, that there is anything unclean in itself, but relatively to the person who so regards it. it is unclean. [Therefore the Christian should be careful as to what he does.] For to cause distress to another about a mere matter of food is to be uncharitable."<p>Two stages are noted in the words "grieved" and "destroy." When one man sees another do that which his own conscience condemns, it causes him pain, but when he is further led on from this to do <span class= "ital">himself</span> what his conscience condemns, he is in danger of a worse fate; he is morally ruined and undone. The work of redemption that Christ has wrought for him is cancelled, and all that great and beneficent scheme is hindered of its operation by an act of thoughtlessness or want of consideration on the part of a fellow Christian.<p><span class= "bld">With thy meat.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">because of meat,</span> on a mere question of meat.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> here certainly, rather than <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> as in the Textus Receptus.
