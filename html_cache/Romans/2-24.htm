It suggests a continuity between the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the importance of the Jewish Scriptures in understanding the message of the Gospel. The phrase often introduces a citation from the Old Testament, showing that the issues Paul addresses are not new but have been longstanding concerns.<p><b>&#8220;God&#8217;s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the negative impact of the behavior of some Jews on the perception of God among non-Jews. The term "blasphemed" implies a serious offense, where God's reputation is tarnished due to the actions of His people. Historically, the Jewish people were meant to be a light to the nations, demonstrating God's holiness and righteousness. However, when they failed to live according to God's laws, it led to the Gentiles speaking ill of God. This reflects a broader biblical theme where the conduct of God's people is meant to reflect His character, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>, where similar accusations are made.<p><b>because of you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase directly addresses the Jewish audience, holding them accountable for the dishonor brought to God's name. It underscores the responsibility of God's people to live in a way that honors Him, as their actions have implications beyond themselves. This is a call to self-examination and repentance, urging the audience to consider how their lives reflect on God. Theologically, it points to the need for genuine faith and obedience, not just outward adherence to the law. This concept is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who criticized the Pharisees for their hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13-36</a>), and in the broader New Testament call for believers to live lives worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Jewish believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_believers_in_rome.htm">Jewish Believers in Rome</a></b><br>The primary audience of this passage, who were relying on the Law and their Jewish identity for righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were observing the behavior of the Jewish believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet whose writings Paul references, specifically <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>, to highlight the consequences of Israel's disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the Jewish and Gentile believers were living, a center of cultural and religious diversity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_consistent_witness.htm">The Importance of Consistent Witness</a></b><br>Our actions as believers should align with our professed faith to avoid causing others to blaspheme God's name.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_hypocrisy.htm">The Consequences of Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Hypocrisy among believers can lead to a negative witness, causing non-believers to reject God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_reflect_god's_character.htm">Responsibility to Reflect God's Character</a></b><br>Believers are called to reflect God's holiness and righteousness in their daily lives, impacting how others perceive God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture_in_self-examination.htm">The Role of Scripture in Self-Examination</a></b><br>Regularly examining our lives against Scripture helps prevent hypocrisy and ensures our actions honor God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_the_gospel.htm">Living Out the Gospel</a></b><br>Our lives should be a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel, drawing others to Christ rather than pushing them away.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_2_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 2:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_24_Reflect_on_our_witness.htm">How does Romans 2:24 challenge us to reflect on our witness to others?

The sense of the original is that the name of God is dishonoured by the enslavement and oppression of His people. A nearer parallel in sense, though more remote in words, may be found in <a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm" title="However,, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.">2Samuel 12:14</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/36-22.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the heathen, where you went.">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>. The Apostle is not careful as to the particular context from which he draws. He knew that he was giving the substance of Scripture, and he takes the aptest words that occur to him at the moment. Translated into our modern modes of thought, the formula "as it is written" at the end of the verse amounts to little more than "in the language of Scripture." The intention, as so frequently with St. Paul, seems, as it were, to be divided between proof and illustration.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
