In the context of <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, Abraham believed God's promise of numerous descendants despite his and Sarah's old age. This steadfastness is a model of faith, contrasting with the Israelites' frequent disbelief during their wilderness journey (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>). Abraham's faith is also a precursor to the New Testament call to live by faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.<p><b>but was strengthened in his faith</b><br>Abraham's faith grew stronger over time, even as the fulfillment of God's promise seemed impossible. This strengthening is akin to the process described in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials test and develop perseverance, leading to maturity. The Greek term used here implies an active empowerment, suggesting that faith is not static but dynamic, growing through reliance on God. This concept is echoed in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul speaks of being able to do all things through Christ who strengthens him.<p><b>and gave glory to God</b><br>Abraham's response to God's promise was to glorify Him, acknowledging His power and faithfulness. This act of giving glory is central to the Christian life, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, which instructs believers to do everything for the glory of God. Abraham's life exemplifies the ultimate purpose of humanity: to glorify God and enjoy Him forever, as stated in the Westminster Shorter Catechism. His faith and actions foreshadow the ultimate glorification of God through Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's promises and brought salvation to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abraham is known as the father of faith.
