In biblical terms, "fruit" often symbolizes the results or consequences of one's actions (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-23</a>). The rhetorical question implies that the actions taken before conversion did not yield positive or lasting benefits. In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing a predominantly Gentile audience familiar with pagan practices, urging them to consider the emptiness of their former ways.<p><b>from the things of which you are now ashamed?</b><br>Shame here indicates a moral and spiritual awakening. In the Greco-Roman world, honor and shame were significant cultural values. Conversion to Christianity often led to a new understanding of what is honorable and shameful, contrasting sharply with previous pagan lifestyles. This transformation is a common theme in Paul's letters, where he emphasizes the renewal of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>) and the rejection of former sinful behaviors (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>).<p><b>The outcome of those things is death.</b><br>This phrase underscores the ultimate consequence of sin, which is spiritual death, as opposed to eternal life offered through Christ (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The concept of death here is not merely physical but also spiritual separation from God. This aligns with the biblical narrative from Genesis, where sin leads to death (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). Paul contrasts this with the life-giving power of Christ, who offers redemption and eternal life, fulfilling the prophetic promises of a Savior who conquers death (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the Christian believers in Rome, addressing issues of sin, grace, and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, they are a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in Rome, facing challenges of integrating their faith with their cultural backgrounds.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_and_death.htm">Sin and Death</a></b><br>Central themes in this passage, representing the spiritual state and consequences of living apart from God's righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to shame and spiritual death.
