In <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, we see God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth, establishing His sovereignty over all things. The concept of God as the originator is echoed in <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, where it states that all things were made through Him. This underscores the belief that everything originates from God, affirming His omnipotence and divine authority.<p><b>and through Him</b><br>This highlights God's sustaining power and providence. <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a> states that "in Him all things hold together," indicating that not only did God create everything, but He also maintains and governs the universe. This reflects the belief in God's active involvement in the world, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled. The phrase also suggests that all things are accomplished through God's will and power, aligning with the idea of divine sovereignty.<p><b>and to Him are all things.</b><br>This phrase points to the ultimate purpose and goal of all creation, which is to glorify God. In <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, it is declared that God is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power because He created all things for His pleasure. This reflects the belief that the ultimate end of all things is to bring glory to God, aligning with the doxological focus of Scripture. It also implies that all creation is moving towards the fulfillment of God's divine plan.<p><b>To Him be the glory forever!</b><br>This doxology is a declaration of praise and worship, acknowledging God's eternal glory. The concept of giving glory to God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>, which emphasizes that glory belongs to God alone. This phrase serves as a reminder of the eternal nature of God's glory, which is unchanging and everlasting. It calls believers to live in a way that reflects and honors God's glory.<p><b>Amen.</b><br>The term "Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," often used to affirm the truthfulness of a statement. In this context, it serves as a confirmation of the preceding declaration of God's glory. The use of "Amen" is common in both Old and New Testament writings, signifying agreement and certainty. It reflects the believer's affirmation of God's sovereignty and the truth of His eternal glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is described as the source, means, and end of all things, emphasizing His sovereignty and glory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and purpose of all creation.

It is a mistake to see in this, as some of the older commentators have done, an allusion to the Trinity. This can hardly be. The subject of the whole verse appears to be God the Father, and the prominent idea is rather the unity of creation corresponding to the unity of the Godhead. The whole system of things issues from and returns to Him, accomplishing in its course His beneficent designs. It is true, however, that the use of the prepositions is such as in more analytical passages would be taken to express the threefold relation (origination, mediate causation, and retrocession) which the doctrine of the Trinity embodies.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For of him; and through him, and unto him, are all things</span>.
