In the Jewish context, knowing God's will was closely tied to the study of the Torah, which was seen as the ultimate guide for living a life pleasing to God. The concept of knowing God's will is also echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/5-17.htm">Ephesians 5:17</a>, where believers are encouraged to understand what the Lord's will is. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but involves a deep, personal relationship with God, as seen in the life of Jesus, who perfectly knew and fulfilled the Father's will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<p><b>and approve of what is superior</b><br>Approving what is superior involves discerning and choosing what is best according to God's standards. This echoes <a href="/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a>, where Paul prays for believers to discern what is best. In the historical context, Jewish leaders often debated what was superior in terms of law and tradition, striving to uphold the highest standards of righteousness. This phrase challenges believers to not only know God's will but to actively choose and endorse what aligns with His perfect nature, reflecting the wisdom and discernment that comes from a life transformed by the Spirit.<p><b>because you are instructed by the law;</b><br>The law here refers to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Jewish life and identity. Being instructed by the law implies a deep familiarity with the Scriptures, as the law was taught from a young age in Jewish culture. This instruction was not just about legalistic adherence but was intended to guide the people into a covenant relationship with God. The law served as a tutor to lead to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), pointing to the need for a Savior and the fulfillment of the law in Jesus. The phrase underscores the privilege and responsibility of those who have been given God's revelation, highlighting the expectation that they live according to its teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Jewish believers in Rome, emphasizing the importance of living according to God's will as revealed in the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_believers_in_rome.htm">Jewish Believers in Rome</a></b><br>The primary audience of this letter, they are familiar with the law and are being reminded of their responsibility to live by it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites and serves as a guide for righteous living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_will.htm">God's Will</a></b><br>The divine purpose and commandments that believers are called to understand and follow.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of this letter reside, a place of significant cultural and religious diversity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_will.htm">Understanding God's Will</a></b><br>As believers, it is crucial to seek a deep understanding of God's will through diligent study of the Scriptures and prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/approving_what_is_superior.htm">Approving What is Superior</a></b><br>We are called to discern and choose what is excellent and aligns with God's standards, rejecting what is inferior or contrary to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/instruction_by_the_law.htm">Instruction by the Law</a></b><br>The law serves as a tutor, guiding us in righteousness.
