It suggests a general revelation of God to humanity, as seen in creation (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>). Historically, this reflects the knowledge of God that was evident to all people, including Gentiles, through nature and conscience (<a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-20</a>). This knowledge is not salvific but leaves humanity without excuse for their unbelief.<p><b>they neither glorified Him as God</b><br>The failure to glorify God points to a lack of reverence and worship due to Him. This is a central theme in Scripture, where God demands and deserves glory (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). Theologically, this reflects the sin of idolatry, where people turn to created things rather than the Creator (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This failure is a rejection of God's rightful place in their lives.<p><b>nor gave thanks to Him</b><br>Ingratitude towards God is a significant issue, as thanksgiving is a fundamental response to His provision and grace (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>). This lack of thankfulness is indicative of a heart that does not recognize God's sovereignty and goodness. Culturally, this reflects a self-centered worldview, prevalent in societies that prioritize human achievement over divine providence.<p><b>but they became futile in their thinking</b><br>Futility in thinking refers to the emptiness and vanity of human reasoning apart from God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>). This futility is a result of rejecting divine truth, leading to moral and intellectual decay. Biblically, this is seen in the wisdom of the world being foolishness to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>). It highlights the contrast between human wisdom and divine revelation.<p><b>and darkened in their foolish hearts</b><br>A darkened heart signifies spiritual blindness and moral corruption (<a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>). This darkness is a consequence of turning away from the light of God's truth (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). Theologically, it represents the state of humanity under sin, unable to perceive or accept spiritual realities without divine intervention.
