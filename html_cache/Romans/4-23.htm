The concept of crediting righteousness is foundational in understanding justification by faith. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, covenants and promises were often sealed by faith and trust, rather than by works or deeds. This sets a precedent for the New Testament teaching that righteousness is imputed to believers through faith in Christ, not by adherence to the law.<p><b>were written not only for Abraham,</b><br>This indicates that the account of Abraham's faith was recorded for a purpose beyond his own life. The historical context shows that the Jewish people revered Abraham as the patriarch of their faith, and his example was meant to instruct future generations. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative that God's promises and actions are not limited to one individual or time but have implications for all believers. It also aligns with the New Testament teaching that the Old Testament scriptures were written for our instruction (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>), showing that the principles of faith and righteousness apply universally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A key figure in the Bible, known as the father of faith.

The history of Abraham is a type of the dispensation of grace; his faith, the imputation of righteousness to him, and his reward, each severally a type of the same things in the Christian. Even in details the resemblance holds. Abraham put faith in a God "who quickeneth the dead," and in like manner the Christian must put faith in God as the Author of a scheme of salvation attested by the resurrection of Christ. The death of Christ was the ground of that scheme, the resurrection of Christ its proof, without which it would not have been brought home to man.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the words]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;it was credited</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Elogisth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3049.htm">Strong's 3049: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reckon, count, charge with; reason, decide, conclude; think, suppose. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to him&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
