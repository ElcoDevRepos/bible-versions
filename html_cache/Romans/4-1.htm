It suggests a continuation of a previous argument, inviting readers to consider the implications of what has been discussed. In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing the relationship between faith and works, particularly in the context of justification.<p><b>that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh,</b><br>Abraham is a central figure in Jewish history, regarded as the patriarch of the Israelites. By referring to him as "our forefather according to the flesh," Paul acknowledges the physical lineage and heritage of the Jewish people. Abraham's significance is not only genealogical but also theological, as he is a model of faith. In <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12-25</a>, Abraham's life and covenant with God are detailed, establishing him as a foundational figure in the narrative of God's people. His faith and obedience are pivotal in understanding the concept of righteousness apart from the Law.<p><b>has discovered?</b><br>This phrase suggests an inquiry into what Abraham learned or experienced regarding faith and righteousness. The discovery here is not merely intellectual but experiential, as Abraham's life exemplifies the principle of being justified by faith. <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> states, "Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness." This discovery is crucial for Paul's argument that righteousness comes through faith, not works, and it prefigures the New Testament revelation of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. Abraham's experience serves as a type of the believer's journey, highlighting the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Known as the patriarch of the Israelites, Abraham is a central figure in the Bible. He is often referred to as the "father of faith" because of his unwavering belief in God's promises.

He was a key figure in the early Christian church and wrote many of the New Testament letters.

Following out this the Apostle shows how even Abraham's case tells, not against, but for the doctrine of justification by faith. Indeed, Abraham himself came under it. And not only so, but those who act upon this doctrine are spiritually descendants of Abraham. It is entirely a mistake to suppose that they of the circumcision only are Abraham's seed. The true seed of Abraham are those who follow his example of faith. He put faith in the promise, they must put their faith in the fulfilment of the promise.<p>(1) To come back to the question of <a href="/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1</a>, repeated in <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;">Romans 3:9</a>, in what did the superiority of Abraham, the great representative of the Jewish race, really consist?<p><span class= "bld">As pertaining to the flesh.</span>--The construction of these words appears to be determined by their position in the sentence. According to the best MSS. they are distinctly separated from "hath found" and joined with "our father." They would therefore mean simply "our father according to the flesh," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by natural descent, as in <a href="/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Hath found.</span>--<span class= "ital">Hath got,</span> or <span class= "ital">gained,</span> by way of advantage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-25.</span> - (5) <span class="accented">Abraham himself shown to have been justified by faith, and not by works, believers being his true heirs.</span> The main points of the argument may be summarized thus: When Abraham obtained a blessing to himself and to his seed for ever, it was by faith, and not by works, that he is declared to have been justified so as to obtain it. Thus the promise to his seed, as well as to himself, rested on the principle of justification by faith only. The Law, of which the principle was essentially different, could not, and did not, in itself fulfil that promise; and that its fulfilment was not dependent on circumcision, or confined to the circumcised, is further shown by the fact that it was before his own circumcision that he received the blessing and the promise, Hence the seed intended in the promise was his spiritual seed, who are of faith such as his was; and in Christ, offering justification through faith to all, the promise is now fulfilled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall we say that Abraham our father according to the flesh hath found?</span> The connection, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the preceding argument is rather with vers. 27, 28 of ch. 3, than with its concluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This appears, not only from the drift of ch. 4, but also from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 2, connecting the thought with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The line of thought is, in the first place, this: We have said that all human glorying is shut out, and that no man can be justified except by faith: how, then (it is important to inquire), was it with Abraham our great progenitor? Did not he at least earn the blessing to his seed by the merit of his works? Had not he, on that ground, whereof to glory? No, not even he. Scripture, in what it says of him, distinctly asserts the contrary. There is uncertainty in this verse as to whether "according to the flesh" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) is to be connected with "our father" or with "hath found." Readings vary in their arrangement of the words. The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. But the great preponderance of authority is in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. The first of these readings requires the connection of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; the second allows it, but suggests the other connection. Theodoret, among the ancients, connecting with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, explains <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> thus: "What righteousness, of Abraham's, wrought <span class="accented">before he believed God</span>, did we ever hear of?" Calvin suggests, as the meaning of the phrase (though himself inclining to the connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," naturaliter vel ex seipso." Bull, similarly ('Harmonic Apostolica,' 'Disputatio Posterior,' c. 12:14-17), "by his natural powers, without the grace of God." Alford, following Meyer, says that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> is in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that it "refers to that department of our being from which spring works, in contrast with that in which is the exercise of faith." Difficulty is avoided if (as is the most natural inference from the best authenticated reading) we take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of our forefather in the way of natural descent, the question being put from the Jewish standpoint; and this in distinction from the other conception of descent from Abraham, according to which all the faithful are called his children (cl. <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 5, 8</a>:<a href="/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>).
