Biblically, rulers are seen as God's servants (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>) to promote good and restrain evil. Historically, the Roman government, under which Paul wrote, was known for its legal system and enforcement of laws. The idea is that a just government should not instill fear in those who do good but should be a deterrent to those who do evil. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/20-8.htm">Proverbs 20:8</a>, which speaks of a king who sits on the throne of judgment, scattering evil with his eyes.<p><b>Do you want to be unafraid of the one in authority?</b><br>This rhetorical question encourages self-reflection on one's relationship with authority. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, where authority was absolute and often harsh, this question would prompt believers to consider their actions and attitudes towards those in power. The Bible consistently teaches respect for authority (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>), emphasizing that fear is unnecessary when one lives righteously. This principle is timeless, encouraging believers to live in a way that aligns with both divine and human laws.<p><b>Then do what is right, and you will have his approval.</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). By doing what is right, believers align themselves with God's will and the laws of the land, which generally leads to approval and peace. The historical context of early Christians, who were often persecuted, adds depth to this instruction, as it reassures them that righteous living is ultimately recognized and rewarded by God, if not always by human authorities. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, where good deeds are meant to glorify God and gain favor with others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, who were navigating their faith under Roman rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_authorities.htm">Roman Authorities</a></b><br>The governing bodies and rulers of the Roman Empire during the time of Paul's writing, known for their power and influence over the regions they controlled.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority.htm">Understanding Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that God establishes authorities for the purpose of maintaining order and justice.

Human law can only take account of that which is actually done, not of the intention.<p>In this and the following verse it is clearly the ideal aspect of the magistracy that the Apostle has in view. So Bishop Butler, in the paragraph next to that just quoted, continues: "If it be objected that good actions, and such as are beneficial to society, are often punished, as in the case of persecution and in other cases, and that ill and mischievous actions are often rewarded, it may be answered distinctly: first, that this is in no sort necessary, and consequently not natural, in the sense in which it is necessary and therefore natural, that ill or mischievous actions should be punished; and in the next place, that good actions are never punished considered as beneficial to society, nor ill actions rewarded under the view of their being hurtful to it. So that it stands good . . . that the Author of Nature has as truly directed that vicious actions, considered as mischievous to society, should be punished, and put mankind under a necessity of punishing them, as He has directed and necessitated us to preserve our lives by food." Occasional failures of justice on the part of the executive do not make the strict administration of justice any the less its proper duty and office.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
