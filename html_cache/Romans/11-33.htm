In biblical context, wisdom and knowledge are often attributed to God as part of His divine nature (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The "riches" suggest an abundance that is beyond human comprehension, echoing <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>, where Paul speaks of the "unsearchable riches of Christ." The depth signifies an infinite quality, aligning with the idea that God's understanding is beyond human reach (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). Historically, this reflects the Jewish understanding of God as omniscient and omnipotent, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>How unsearchable are His judgments,</b><br>God's judgments refer to His decisions and decrees, which are often beyond human understanding. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The term "unsearchable" suggests that human beings cannot fully grasp or question God's decisions, as seen in <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>, where it is asked if one can fathom the mysteries of God. This reflects a cultural context where divine wisdom was revered and accepted as ultimate truth, often beyond human reasoning.<p><b>and untraceable His ways!</b><br>The "ways" of God refer to His methods and plans, which are often mysterious and not easily understood by humans. The term "untraceable" indicates that God's paths and purposes cannot be mapped or predicted by human logic. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that God's plans are sovereign and often hidden until revealed in His timing (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). Theologically, this points to the trust believers are called to have in God's providence, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where believers are encouraged to trust in the Lord with all their heart and not lean on their own understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological insights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose wisdom, knowledge, judgments, and ways are being extolled by Paul.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incomprehensibility_of_god.htm">The Incomprehensibility of God</a></b><br>God's wisdom and knowledge are beyond human understanding.

The LXX. (<a href="/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2</a>) gives an entirely different sense of the passage; and it would thus appear, as may be seen also in other cases, that St. Paul, though usually quoting more or less freely from the LXX., was familiar also with the Hebrew text, and exercised judgment in his citations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">O,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8046;</span> <span class="translit">(&#332;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5599.htm">Strong's 5599: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary interjection; as a sign of the vocative case, O; as a note of exclamation, oh.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] depth</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(bathos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_899.htm">Strong's 899: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the same as bathus; profundity, i.e. extent; mystery.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of [the] riches</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(ploutou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4149.htm">Strong's 4149: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of pletho; wealth, i.e. money, possessions, or abundance, richness, valuable bestowment.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of [the] wisdom</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(sophias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4678.htm">Strong's 4678: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wisdom, insight, skill (human or divine), intelligence.
