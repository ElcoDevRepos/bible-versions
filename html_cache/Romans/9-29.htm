Isaiah, a major prophet in the Old Testament, often spoke of God's plans for Israel and the nations. This reference underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that the events in Romans are part of God's longstanding plan.<p><b>Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants:</b><br>The "Lord of Hosts" is a title that emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. The mention of "descendants" refers to a remnant, a recurring theme in the Bible where God preserves a faithful group despite widespread unfaithfulness. This concept is seen in the stories of Noah, Elijah, and the return from Babylonian exile, highlighting God's mercy and faithfulness.<p><b>we would have become like Sodom,</b><br>Sodom is a symbol of extreme wickedness and divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The comparison suggests that without God's intervention, Israel would have faced total destruction due to their sin. This serves as a warning and a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>we would have resembled Gomorrah:</b><br>Gomorrah, like Sodom, was destroyed due to its sinfulness. The use of both cities emphasizes the severity of the judgment that could have befallen Israel. This phrase reinforces the idea of God's mercy in preserving a remnant, contrasting the fate of those who reject God with the salvation of those who remain faithful. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is also a type of final judgment, pointing to the ultimate separation of the righteous and the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's writings are often quoted in the New Testament.

We stand, like Israel, wholly dependent on the Lord of Hosts who graciously leaves descendants, keeping His people alive for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Said before</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in an earlier part of his book.

This quotation is from <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>, and, though it seems to have no obvious reference to the Messianic age, it expresses the same idea as the other, of a remnant only being saved; and it is quoted suitably, occurring as it does at the beginning of the Book of Isaiah, and being a sort of key-note of the prevailing purport of his prophecies. The force of all the above quotations is much enhanced, if we remember that they are not mere isolated texts, but suggestive specimens of many prophetic utterances to the same effect. All familiar with the prophetic writings are aware that main ideas constantly recurring are: First, judgments to come upon the chosen people, painted often in many consecutive verses without relief; but secondly, after such denunciations, a dawn of hope and comfort appearing, and culminating in unutterable blessing under the Messiah's kingdom; and thirdly, this dawn of hope being for a remnant only of the race, compared in one place to a gleaning of the grapes when the vintage is done (<a href="/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>); and fourthly, the association with this remnant, not only of the "outcasts of Israel" gathered from all lands, but also of a multitude of Gentiles, who should be gathered into the Messiah's kingdom (cf. <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>, etc.; <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>; <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[It is] just as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
