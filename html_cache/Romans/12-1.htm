The term "urge" reflects a strong appeal, emphasizing the importance of the message. "Brothers" signifies a familial relationship among believers, highlighting unity and shared faith in Christ.<p><b>on account of God&#8217;s mercy</b><br>This phrase underscores the motivation for the appeal: God's mercy. Throughout Romans, Paul elaborates on God's grace and mercy, particularly in salvation through Jesus Christ. This mercy is the foundation for the believer's response, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>to offer your bodies as living sacrifices</b><br>The concept of sacrifice is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, where sacrifices were offered in the temple. Here, Paul redefines sacrifice as a living, ongoing act of worship, contrasting with the dead sacrifices of the Old Covenant. This involves dedicating one's entire being to God, reflecting a life of holiness and service.<p><b>holy and pleasing to God</b><br>Holiness is a recurring theme in Scripture, calling believers to be set apart for God's purposes. A life that is "pleasing to God" aligns with His will and character. This echoes Old Testament teachings where sacrifices had to be without blemish, symbolizing purity and dedication.<p><b>which is your spiritual service of worship</b><br>The term "spiritual" can also be understood as "reasonable" or "rational," suggesting that offering oneself to God is a logical response to His mercy. "Service of worship" implies that true worship extends beyond rituals to encompass a lifestyle of devotion and obedience, aligning with Jesus' teaching that worship is in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is writing to the Christian believers in Rome, urging them to live out their faith in practical ways.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, they were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy.htm">God&#8217;s Mercy</a></b><br>A central theme in this verse, referring to the compassion and grace God has shown through Jesus Christ, which serves as the foundation for the call to live sacrificially.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_living_sacrifices.htm">Understanding Living Sacrifices</a></b><br>In the original Greek, the term "sacrifice" (thysia) implies a complete offering.

This wholehearted, everyday surrender is the only reasonable&#8212;and deeply joyful&#8212;way to worship the Lord who saved us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XII.</span><p>(1) At this point the Apostle turns from the speculative, or doctrinal, portion of his Epistle, and begins a series of practical exhortations to his readers as to their lives as Christians. In the first two verses of the chapter he speaks of this in general terms, but then goes on to give a number of special precepts in no very distinct arrangement or order.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>--We may well believe that the Apostle having brought his argument up to a climax at the close of the last chapter, would make a pause in his dictation, and perhaps not resume it until another sitting. The one prevailing impression left on his mind, both by the argument just ended and by the whole previous portion of the Epistle, is a profound sense of the merciful and benevolent purposes of God, who, out of seeming evil, only educes the highest good. This sense is still strong upon him, and he makes it the link of transition by which the earnest practical exhortations which follow are bound to what precedes. The sequence is as much one of feeling as of ratiocination.<p><span class= "bld">Your bodies.</span>--Not merely a periphrasis for "yourselves," but in the strict sense "your bodies," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the very part of you which is apt to be "an occasion of falling." The Apostle takes the two main parts of human nature separately. In this verse he deals with the bodies of men, in the next verse with the "mind," or the intellectual and spiritual faculties.<p><span class= "bld">A living sacrifice</span>.--"How is the body to become a sacrifice? Let thine eye look upon no evil thing, and it hath become a sacrifice; let thy tongue speak nothing filthy, and it hath become an offering; let thy hand do no lawless deed, and it hath become a whole burnt offering. But this is not enough, we must do good works also; let the hand do alms, the mouth bless them that despitefully use us, and the ear find leisure evermore for <span class= "ital">the</span> hearing of Scripture. For sacrifice can be made only of that which is clean; sacrifice is a firstfruit of other actions. Let us, then, from our hands, and feet, and mouth, and all our other members, yield a firstfruit unto God" (St. Chrysostom).<p>The idea contained in sacrifice is that of dedication. We are to <span class= "ital">dedicate</span> our bodies to God. But there is to be this distinction between the old Jewish sacrifices and the Christian sacrifice: the one was of dead animals, the other of the living man. The worshipper must offer, or present, before God, <span class= "ital">himself,</span> with all his living energies and powers directed consciously to God's service.<p><span class= "bld">Holy, acceptable unto God.</span>--The qualification sought for in the Jewish sacrifices was that they were to be unblemished, without spot. In like manner the Christian's sacrifice must be holy and pure in God's sight, otherwise it cannot be acceptable to Him.<p><span class= "bld">Reasonable service.</span>--The English phrase is somewhat ambiguous. It might mean "a service <span class= "ital">demanded</span> by reason." Such, however is not the sense of the Greek, but rather "a service <span class= "ital">of</span> the reason," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a service <span class= "ital">rendered</span> by the reason. Just as under the old dispensation the mind expressed its devotion through the ritual of sacrifice, so now under the new dispensation its worship takes the form of a self-dedication; its service consists in holiness of life, temperance, soberness, and chastity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>. - III. HORTATORY. (See summary of contents, p. 17.) It is St. Paul's way to supplement his doctrinal treatises with detailed practical directions as to the conduct that should of necessity ensue on belief in the doctrines propounded. So also in <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, etc., where, as here, he connects his exhortations with what has gone before by the initiatory <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. Beyond his exposition of the truth for its own sake, he has always a further practical aim. Saving faith is ever with him a living faith, to be shown by its fruits. Nor, according to him, will these fruits follow, unless the believer himself does his part in cultivating them: else were these earnest and particular exhortations needless. If, on the one hand, he is the great assertor of our salvation being through faith and all of grace, he is no less distinct for the necessity of works following, and of the power of man's free-will to use or resist grace; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>, where, speaking of himself, he does not mean to say that grace had made him what he was in spite of himself, but that grace had not been in vain, because he himself had worked with grace. All was of grace, but he himself had laboured, assisted by grace working with him. It will be observed how comprehensive is the survey of Christian duty that here follows, reaching to all the relations of life, as well as to internal disposition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>. - E. <span class="accented">Various practical duties enforced.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beseech you therefore, brethren</span> (he does not command, as did Moses in the Law; he beseeches; he is but a fellow-servant, with his brethren, of Christ; he does not "lord it over God's heritage" (cf. <a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>), but trusts that they will of their own accord respond to "the mercies of God" in Christ, which he has set before them), <span class="cmt_word">by the mercies of God</span> ("Qui misericordia Dei recte movetur in omnem Dei <span class="accented">voluntatem</span> ingreditur. At anima irae obnoxia vix quiddam juvatur adhortationibus," Bengel), <span class="cmt_word">that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the usual one for the <span class="accented">presenting</span> of sacrificial animals at the altar (Xen., 'Anab.,' 6:1.22; Lucian, 'De Sacrif.,' 13. The LXX in <a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7, 10</a>, has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. Cf. <a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>: <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 28</a>, and <span class="accented">supra, 6:</span>13). <span class="accented">Our bodies</span> are here specified, with probable reference to the bodies of victims which were offered in the old ritual. But our offering differs from them in being "a <span class="accented">living</span> sacrifice," replete with life and energy to do God's will (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6, 7, 8</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5, 6, 7</a>), yea, and oven inspired with a new life - a life from the dead (<a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>). Further, the thought is suggested of the abuse of the body to uncleanness prevalent in heathen society (cf. <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>). The bodies of Christians are "members of Christ," "temples of the Holy Ghost," consecrated to God, and to be devoted to his service (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>, etc.); and not in heart only, but in actual life, of which the body is the agent, we are to offer ourselves, after the example of Christ. <span class="accented">Your reasonable service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) must be taken in apposition to "present your bodies, rather than to "sacrifice," it being the act of offering, and not the thing offered. that constitutes the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This word is especially used for the ceremonial worship of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25, 26</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1, 6, 9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>), the counterpart of which in Christians is, according to St. Paul, not ceremonial service, but rather that of a devoted life (cf. <a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>; <a href="/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; Hebrews 41:28). The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> has been variously understood. It probably means <span class="accented">rational</span>, denoting a moral and spiritual serving of God, in implied opposition to mechanical acts of outward worship. "Respectu intellectus et voluntatis" (Bengel). It may be taken to express the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). Though the offering of the body is being spoken of, yet "bodily self-sacrifice is an <span class="accented">ethical</span> act" (Meyer). Cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>. The word itself occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>, where its meaning, though obscure, may be similar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
