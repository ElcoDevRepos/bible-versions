The demonstration of His righteousness refers to God's moral perfection and justice. In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing the issue of God's justice in forgiving sins. The Old Testament sacrificial system pointed to the need for atonement, but it was ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>). God's righteousness is demonstrated through the cross, where His justice and mercy meet (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>).<p><b>at the present time</b><br>This indicates the specific moment in history when God chose to reveal His plan of salvation through Jesus Christ. The "present time" refers to the era of the New Covenant, inaugurated by Christ's death and resurrection. This was a pivotal moment in salvation history, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretold the suffering servant who would bear the sins of many.<p><b>so as to be just</b><br>God's justice is a central theme in Scripture, and this phrase underscores that He remains just even while forgiving sinners. The justice of God requires that sin be punished, and through Christ's sacrificial death, the penalty for sin is paid. This aligns with the legal imagery found throughout the Bible, where God is depicted as a righteous judge (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p><b>and to justify</b><br>To justify means to declare righteous. In the context of Romans, justification is a legal term signifying acquittal from guilt. This is a key doctrine in Christian theology, emphasizing that believers are declared righteous before God not by their own works, but through faith in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This concept is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where faith was credited as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p><b>the one who has faith in Jesus</b><br>Faith in Jesus is the means by which individuals receive justification. This faith is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Christ's finished work on the cross. The New Testament consistently teaches that salvation is through faith alone (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>). This faith connects believers to the promises of God, as seen in the lives of Old Testament figures like Abraham and David, who were justified by faith (<a href="/romans/4.htm">Romans 4:1-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His righteousness and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The one through whom believers are justified by faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Romans, explaining the theological implications of God's righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The event where God's justice and mercy meet, providing the means for justification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness_demonstrated.htm">God's Righteousness Demonstrated</a></b><br>God's righteousness is not just a passive attribute but is actively demonstrated through His actions, particularly in the sacrifice of Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_justification.htm">Justice and Justification</a></b><br>God remains just while justifying sinners, showing that His justice is not compromised by His mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_jesus.htm">Faith in Jesus</a></b><br>Justification is available to all who have faith in Jesus, emphasizing the importance of personal belief and trust in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/present_time_relevance.htm">Present Time Relevance</a></b><br>The demonstration of God's righteousness is relevant for all times, including the present, showing the timeless nature of the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_justified_lives.htm">Living Justified Lives</a></b><br>As recipients of justification, believers are called to live lives that reflect God's righteousness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_3_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 3:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_3_26_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Romans 3:26 demonstrate God's justice and mercy simultaneously?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_3_26_reveal_about_God.htm">What does "just and the justifier" reveal about God's character in Romans 3:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_God_s_justice_grace_daily.htm">How can we apply God's justice and grace in our daily interactions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Romans_3_26_Eph_2_8-9_Faith_in_salvation.htm">How does Romans 3:26 connect with Ephesians 2:8-9 on salvation by faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Romans_3_26_inspire_trust.htm">In what ways does Romans 3:26 encourage trust in God's righteous judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_3_26_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">How does Romans 3:26 demonstrate God's justice and mercy simultaneously?

A special word is used to indicate that these sins were not wiped away and dismissed altogether, but rather "passed over" or "overlooked." This was due to the forbearance of God, who, as it were, <span class= "ital">suspended</span> the execution of His vengeance. Now the Apostle shows by the death of Christ that justice that had apparently slept was vindicated.<p>Thus God appeared in a double character, at once as just or righteous Himself, and as producing a state of righteousness in the believer. Under the Old Testament God had been revealed as <span class= "ital">just;</span> but the justice or righteousness of God was not met by any corresponding righteousness on the part of man, and therefore could only issue in condemnation. Under the New Testament the justice of God remained the same, but it <span class= "ital">was</span> met by a corresponding state of righteousness in the believer a righteousness, however, not inherent, but superinduced by God Himself through the process of justification by faith. In this way the great Messianic condition of righteousness was fulfilled.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He did this]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
