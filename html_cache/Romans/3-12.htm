The concept of turning away is rooted in the idea of rebellion against God, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Historically, this reflects Israel's repeated turning from God to idolatry, as seen in the narratives of the Judges and Kings. Theologically, it underscores humanity's inherent sinfulness and need for redemption, a central tenet of Christian doctrine.<p><b>they have together become worthless;</b><br>The term "worthless" here can be understood as becoming unprofitable or corrupt, similar to spoiled fruit. This reflects the moral decay that results from turning away from God. In the cultural context of the time, worth was often measured by one's adherence to the law and societal norms. Biblically, this phrase connects to the idea of humanity's inability to achieve righteousness on its own, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, where human righteousness is compared to "filthy rags."<p><b>there is no one who does good,</b><br>This statement emphasizes the total depravity of humanity, a doctrine that suggests every part of human nature is tainted by sin. It aligns with <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, which states that there is no righteous person on earth who does good and never sins. This phrase challenges the cultural belief in inherent human goodness and underscores the need for divine intervention through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate embodiment of goodness.<p><b>not even one.&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of this phrase serves to reinforce the absolute nature of the claim. It leaves no room for exceptions, highlighting the comprehensive scope of sin's impact on humanity. This echoes the prophetic declarations of the Old Testament, where the prophets often lamented the lack of righteousness among the people. In the New Testament, it sets the stage for the necessity of Christ's atoning sacrifice, as only through Him can humanity be reconciled to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, this early Christian community was diverse, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_and_gentile_believers.htm">Jewish and Gentile Believers</a></b><br>The broader audience of Paul's message, representing the universal scope of sin and the need for salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_testament_references.htm">Old Testament References</a></b><br>Paul draws from the Psalms and Ecclesiastes to emphasize the universality of sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_human_condition.htm">The Human Condition</a></b><br>The state of humanity described in this verse, highlighting the fallen nature and need for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_sin.htm">The Universality of Sin</a></b><br>Every person, regardless of background, has turned away from God.

This isn&#8217;t about a few isolated rebels; it&#8217;s every one of us. <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> affirms, &#8220;We all like sheep have gone astray,&#8221; showing that wandering is humanity&#8217;s default. The idea is active deviation, not passive indifference&#8212;we choose self-rule over God&#8217;s rule. Jesus&#8217; parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-24</a>) dramatizes this turning away, illustrating how sin always involves walking out on the Father&#8217;s household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have together become worthless</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;they have together become worthless.&#8221; The word pictures something spoiled, no longer fit for its intended use&#8212;much like salt that has lost its savor (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>). Sin doesn&#8217;t merely stain; it incapacitates. When humans turn from God, the very purpose for which we were made&#8212;to glorify Him and enjoy Him forever&#8212;gets forfeited. <a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a> notes, &#8220;To the corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure,&#8221; highlighting how sin contaminates motives and actions alike. The collective sense (&#8220;together&#8221;) stresses that corruption is corporate, affecting families, societies, and cultures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There is no one who does good</b><p>Paul presses on: &#8220;There is no one who does good.&#8221; Goodness, in God&#8217;s eyes, isn&#8217;t graded on a curve; it requires perfection (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). Outward philanthropy may impress people, but without faith it &#8220;cannot please God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). Jesus, confronting the rich young ruler, said, &#8220;No one is good except God alone&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-18.htm">Mark 10:18</a>), underscoring that any genuine good must flow from God&#8217;s own character. This exposes our need for a righteousness outside ourselves, fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not even one</b><p>The final phrase silences all objections: &#8220;not even one.&#8221; Paul shuts every escape hatch by excluding exceptions. <a href="/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a> declares, &#8220;Scripture has imprisoned everything under sin,&#8221; so the ground is level at the foot of the cross. This sweeping indictment prepares the way for the gospel: after <a href="/romans/3-12.htm">Romans 3:12</a> comes <a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-24</a>, where &#8220;the righteousness of God has been revealed&#8230;through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.&#8221; Our inability becomes the backdrop for God&#8217;s grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/3-12.htm">Romans 3:12</a> stacks phrase upon phrase to prove universal sinfulness: everyone has turned from God&#8217;s way, forfeited their created purpose, and is incapable of producing genuine good&#8212;without exception.
