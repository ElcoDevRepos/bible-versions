In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing the Jewish people who were zealous for God but lacked knowledge (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>). The righteousness of God refers to the divine standard of holiness and justice, which is revealed through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>). This ignorance is not due to a lack of information, as the Law and the Prophets pointed to Christ (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>), but rather a spiritual blindness (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14-16</a>).<p><b>and sought to establish their own</b><br>Here, Paul critiques the attempt to create a self-derived standard of righteousness. The Jewish people, relying on the Law of Moses, believed that adherence to the law could achieve righteousness (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). This reflects a broader human tendency to rely on personal efforts or moral codes to attain favor with God, which is contrary to the message of grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The historical context shows that the Pharisees and other religious leaders emphasized strict adherence to the law, often adding traditions that obscured its true purpose (<a href="/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8-9</a>).<p><b>they did not submit to God&#8217;s righteousness</b><br>This phrase indicates a refusal to accept the righteousness that God provides through faith in Christ. Submission here implies a recognition of one's inability to achieve righteousness on their own and a willingness to accept God's provision through Jesus. This refusal is a central theme in Paul's argument, contrasting the law-based righteousness with faith-based righteousness (<a href="/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30-32</a>). Theologically, this submission is an act of humility and faith, acknowledging Christ as the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and the only means of salvation (<a

attribute; it is His gift of a right standing offered through faith (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; 3:21-22).<p>&#8226; By focusing on the Law&#8217;s external demands, many failed to see that the Law itself pointed to a coming righteousness apart from works (<a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This ignorance was willful, not accidental. Light had been given through the prophets and through Christ Himself (<a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-38</a>), yet it was set aside.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seeking to establish their own</b><p>When people do not understand the righteousness God supplies, they default to self-made systems.<p>&#8226; Israel multiplied commandments and traditions, believing careful rule-keeping could earn favor (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>; <a href="/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; The Pharisee in Jesus&#8217; parable &#8220;stood by himself and prayed, &#8216;God, I thank You that I am not like other men&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>), illustrating the danger of performance-based confidence.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s personal testimony underscores the futility of this path: he counted his pedigree and achievements &#8220;loss, so that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did not submit to God&#8217;s righteousness</b><p>Refusal to yield is the tragic climax.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s righteousness is received, never achieved.
