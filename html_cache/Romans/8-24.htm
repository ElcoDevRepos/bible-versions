The context of <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a> is the assurance of salvation and the future glory that awaits believers. The "hope" mentioned here is the confident expectation of eternal life and redemption. This hope is rooted in the promises of God, as seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasizes salvation by grace through faith. The concept of hope in the Bible often involves trust in God's promises, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for.<p><b>but hope that is seen is no hope at all.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the nature of biblical hope as something not yet realized or visible. In the cultural context of the time, hope was often associated with the unseen future, contrasting with the tangible and immediate. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>, which encourages believers to fix their eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. The unseen hope is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing trust in God's future fulfillment of His promises, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs like Abraham, who hoped against hope (<a href="/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a>).<p><b>Who hopes for what he can already see?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the essence of hope as anticipation for what is not yet possessed. In the historical context, the early Christians faced persecution and trials, making the unseen hope of future glory particularly significant. This idea is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, where the faith of the ancients is commended because they looked forward to what was promised but not yet received. The question challenges believers to maintain their focus on the eternal and the promises of God, rather than the temporary and visible, as seen in <a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>, which instructs believers to set their minds on things above.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The event and process of being saved from sin and its consequences, a central theme in Christian theology.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hope.htm">Hope</a></b><br>A significant theme in this passage, referring to the confident expectation of what God has promised.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the Holy Spirit is a key figure in <a href="/bsb/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>, empowering believers and interceding for them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_hope_in_salvation.htm">Understanding Hope in Salvation</a></b><br>Biblical hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's promises.<br><br>Salvation is both a present reality and a future hope, grounded in the work of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_unseen_hope.htm">The Nature of Unseen Hope</a></b><br>True hope is characterized by its focus on the unseen and eternal, rather than the visible and temporary.<br><br>Believers are called to trust in God's promises, even when they are not immediately visible.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_hope.htm">Living in Hope</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to live with a forward-looking perspective, anticipating the fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>This hope should influence daily life, providing strength and perseverance in trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit sustains our hope, reminding us of God's promises and interceding on our behalf.<br><br>Believers are empowered by the Spirit to maintain hope in the face of challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_8_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 8:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_8_24_Hope_s_nature_in_Christianity.htm">How does Romans 8:24 define the nature of hope in Christian life?

Once a promise turns into sight, it ceases to be hope; it becomes experience.<p>&#8226;&#8194;Faith and hope work together: &#8220;Now faith is the assurance of what we hope for and the certainty of what we do not see&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Paul encourages fixing our eyes &#8220;not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Abraham modeled this by trusting God&#8217;s word against visible odds (<a href="/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18-21</a>). In the same way, believers press on amid suffering, confident that present trials are temporary and glory is permanent (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who hopes for what he can already see?</b><p>&#8220;Who hopes for what he can already see?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>c) is Paul&#8217;s simple, logical question.

Patience is evidence of authentic hope.<p>&#8226;&#8194;James points to the farmer who waits for harvest (<a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>); likewise, we await Christ&#8217;s return.<p>&#8226;&#8194;John ties purity to hope: &#8220;When He appears&#8230;we shall be like Him&#8230;everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;The unseen nature of our hope keeps us loosely attached to earthly comforts and firmly attached to eternal realities (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a> teaches that believers were saved into a sure, future-oriented hope&#8212;the full redemption that Christ will unveil. Because hope deals with what is still unseen, it calls us to trust God&#8217;s promises, endure present hardships, and live in purity and anticipation. What we do not yet see is nonetheless guaranteed, and that certainty fuels perseverance until faith becomes sight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) Why do I say that we "wait for the adoption?" Because hope in the future is of the very essence of the Christian's life. It was by hope that he was saved. Hope, at the time when he first believed, made him realise his salvation, though it is still in the future. This is, indeed, implied in the very nature of hope. Its proper object is that which is future and unseen.<p><span class= "bld">By hope.</span>--It is usually faith rather than hope that is represented as the means or instrument of salvation. Nor can it quite rightly be said that hope is <span class= "ital">an aspect</span> of faith, because faith and hope are expressly distinguished and placed as co-ordinate with each other in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a> : "and now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three." Hope is rather a secondary cause of salvation, because it sets salvation vividly before the believer, and so makes him strive to obtain it.<p>It must not, however, be overlooked that the phrase translated "by hope," may be taken, rather to mean <span class= "ital">"with"</span> or <span class= "ital">"in</span> hope." It will then serve to limit the idea of salvation. We were saved, indeed, in an inchoate and imperfect manner, but our full salvation is still a subject for hope, and therefore it is not past but still in the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For by</span> (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hope we were saved</span>; not <span class="accented">are saved, as</span> in the Authorized Version. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 15, points to the time of conversion. The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>, which has no preposition before it, seems here, to have a <span class="accented">modal</span> rather than <span class="accented">medial</span> sense; for faith, not hope, is that <span class="accented">whereby</span> we are ever said to be saved. The meaning is that when the state of salvation was entered upon, hope was an essential element in its appropriation. A condition, not of attainment, but of hope, is therefore the normal condition of the regenerate now; and so, after shortly pointing out the very meaning of hope, the apostle enforces his previous conclusion, that they must be content at present to wait with patience. <span class="cmt_word">But hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it</span>. Now comes in a further thought, and a very interesting one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/8-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
