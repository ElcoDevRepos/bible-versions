Israel is central to God's redemptive plan, chosen to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). Historically, Israel's identity was solidified through the Exodus and the giving of the Law at Sinai. Archaeological evidence, such as the Merneptah Stele, confirms Israel's presence in Canaan during the late Bronze Age.<p><b>Theirs is the adoption as sons;</b><br>This adoption signifies Israel's unique relationship with God, who chose them as His people (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a holy people chosen by God. The adoption foreshadows the New Testament teaching of believers being adopted as God's children through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>).<p><b>theirs the divine glory</b><br>The divine glory, or Shekinah, refers to God's manifest presence, which dwelt among Israel, particularly in the Tabernacle and later the Temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). This glory was a visible sign of God's covenant with Israel and His holiness. It prefigures the glory of God revealed in Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and the covenants;</b><br>The covenants include those made with Abraham, Moses, and David, each progressively revealing God's plan of salvation. The Abrahamic covenant promised land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The Mosaic covenant established the Law (Exodus 19-24), and the Davidic covenant promised an eternal kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). These covenants find fulfillment in the New Covenant through Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>theirs the giving of the law,</b><br>The Law, given at Sinai, was central to Israel's identity, setting them apart as God's people (Exodus 20). It provided moral, ceremonial, and civil guidelines. The Law also pointed to humanity's need for a Savior, fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p><b>the temple worship,</b><br>Temple worship was the heart of Israel's religious life, involving sacrifices, festivals, and rituals prescribed in the Law (Leviticus). The Temple in Jerusalem was the focal point of God's presence and Israel's worship. It prefigures Christ, who is the true Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>and the promises.</b><br>The promises include God's assurances of blessing, land, and a future Messiah (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). These promises are integral to the biblical narrative and find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the "Yes" to all God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary recipients of the blessings mentioned in <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>.

Even in exile God reminds them, &#8220;Only you have I known of all the families of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>). <a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-2</a> affirms that &#8220;the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.&#8221; Israel&#8217;s national calling remains a display case for God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The adoption as sons</b><p>Israel&#8217;s story is framed by a familial claim. At the Exodus the Lord told Pharaoh, &#8220;Israel is My firstborn son&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). Centuries later Hosea echoed, &#8220;Out of Egypt I called My son&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>). Corporate adoption does not negate individual salvation, but it does emphasize covenant privilege: God placed this nation, as a son, under His special care. Believers from every nation share in adoption through Christ (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>), yet Paul reminds us that Israel experienced that status first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The divine glory</b><p>God&#8217;s visible presence&#8212;&#8220;the glory of the LORD&#8221;&#8212;settled on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>), filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>), and later the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Isaiah fell before that glory (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>). Ezekiel watched it depart because of national sin (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>). John testified that in Jesus &#8220;we beheld His glory&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The privilege of beholding and housing that radiant presence was uniquely Israel&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The covenants</b><p>From Abraham onward, God bound Himself to Israel through covenant promises:<p>&#8226; Abrahamic&#8212;&#8220;All nations will be blessed through you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Mosaic&#8212;&#8220;If you obey My voice&#8230; you will be My treasured possession&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Davidic&#8212;&#8220;I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; New Covenant&#8212;&#8220;I will put My law within them and write it on their hearts&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p>Each covenant layers grace upon grace, culminating in the Messiah and guaranteeing God&#8217;s ongoing commitment to Israel&#8217;s future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The giving of the law</b><p>While moral conscience exists worldwide, only Israel received the Law etched in stone by God&#8217;s own finger (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). Moses highlights the uniqueness: &#8220;What great nation has statutes and ordinances as righteous as this law?&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-8.htm">Deuteronomy 4:8</a>). Paul affirms that the Jews &#8220;were entrusted with the oracles of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>). The Law revealed God&#8217;s holiness, exposed human sin, and served as &#8220;a guardian until Christ came&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The temple worship</b><p>Leviticus lays out the sacrificial system, enabling sinful people to draw near a holy God. Daily offerings (<a href="/bsb/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>), annual feasts (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>), and the Day of Atonement (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>) all pointed toward the ultimate Lamb. Solomon&#8217;s dedication prayer captures the heart of temple worship: &#8220;May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). <a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1-10</a> later explains how each ritual foreshadowed Christ&#8217;s finished work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The promises</b><p>Paul gathers every prophetic hope into this final phrase.

Peter proclaims, &#8220;God has fulfilled to us their children the promise He made to our fathers by raising Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32-33</a>).

Amen.</span> Here "the adoption" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) means the selection of Israel to be God's peculiar people (cf. <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn;" <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, "Ye are the children of the Lord your God;" <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt;" also <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>.

It is, of course, a different idea from that of the spiritual <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of believers (at present as in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, or to come as in <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>), though it might be typical of it. "The glory" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) seems best explained by reference to <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-18</a>, where the visible glory, said to have rested on the mercy-seat and to have illuminated for a time the face of Moses, is regarded as expressing the glory, in a higher sense, of the old dispensation, which, however, was destined to fade away in the greater glory of the revelation of God in Christ. The word may be thus taken to denote, not simply the <span class="accented">Sheehinab</span>, or the glory on Mount Sinai, but rather what was signified by these manifestations. It was probably a recognized term in use with reference to the giving of the Law. "The covenants" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and "the promises" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), both in the plural, include those made with and given to Abraham and the other patriarchs, as well as the Mosaic ones. The former word is wrongly taken by some as denoting the <span class="accented">tables</span> of the covenant. <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is obviously the divinely appointed ceremonial worship, the typical significance of which is explained at length in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the same word is used. "The fathers" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) are the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the original recipients of the promises, descent from whom was made such account of by the Jews, as being the foundation of their privileges (cf. <a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>; <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>; and, for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this sense, cf. <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The last and crowning distinction of the Jewish race is mentioned last, viz. the fleshly descent therefrom of Christ, even of him who in his higher nature is "over all, God blessed for ever." This is certainly the most obvious meaning of the conclusion of ver. 5, as far as the language is concerned, and the one understood by all ancient commentators. Some moderns, however, as is well known, have raised objections to this interpretation of the clause, based solely on the supposed improbability that St. Paul would have so designated Christ. Some would, therefore, get over this imagined difficulty by putting a full stop after <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, and taking what follows as a doxology to God the Father, thus: "God, who is over all, be blessed for ever." The apostle is supposed, according to this interpretation, to have been moved to this parenthetical utterance by his contemplation of the Divine favours to Israel, which he had been recounting. Some have suggested the full stop being put after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to refer <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> to Christ, and take only what follows as a doxology, or, as some would have it, as a statement. But, in either case, the idea of so unlikely a breaking up of the sentence may be dismissed as untenable. Others, without thus breaking up the sentence, take the whole of it, beginning with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, to be, not a doxology, but a statement, thus at- tempting to meet the objection to its being a doxology (to be noticed presently), arising from the collocation of the words. But a mere assertion that God <span class="accented">is</span> blessed for ever would seem peculiarly uncalled for and purposeless here. Meyer, being a critic of deserved repute, and an upholder of the modern interpretation of the clause, taking the whole of it together as a doxology to the Father, it may suffice to state his arguments. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That St. Paul, though regarding the Son of God as the image of God, of the essence of God, the agent in creation and preservation, the judge of all, the object of prayer, and the possessor of Divine glory and fulness of grace (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>; Philippians it. 6; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; Colossians 2:9; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>), never expressly calls him <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but always clearly distinguishes him as the <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; and that the passages in which <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> has been supposed by some to apply to him (as in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; and <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>) are wrongly so understood; <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, being also undoubtedly the original reading in <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. (Of St. Paul's usual distinction between <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, when he is referring to the economy of redemption, other instances are found in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4, 5, 6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4, 5, 6</a>. That he does usually so distinguish is undoubted.) <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That, according to the old ecclesiastical interpretation, "Christ would be called here, not only God, but even <span class="accented">God over all</span>, and consequently would be designated as <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, which is absolutely incompatible with the entire view of the New Testament as to the dependence of the Son on the Father." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That "in the properly apostolical writings (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a> does not belong to them, nor does <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a>) we never meet with a doxology to Christ in the form which is usual in doxologies to God." Meyer adds in a note, "<a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> certainly refers to Christ; but this is just one of the traces of post-apostolic composition. Now, to these arguments it may be replied as follows: To (1) that, though it may be true that St. Paul in no other passage expressly calls Christ <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, yet his doctrine with respect to his Divine nature is in accordance with the expression; for surely the term <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is applicable to him who is spoken of, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; that his usual distinction between the supreme God and Christ as Mediator by no means precludes his declaring in express terms Christ's essential Deity in a passage where such a declaration is suitable and called for; that even St. John, who is acknowledged by all to have peculiarly set forth the Divine essence of Christ, only once uses the expression, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or any exactly equivalent to it. To argument (2) it may be replied that the language used does <span class="accented">not</span> identify Christ with the Father as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, especially if we suppose a comma after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so that the meaning would he, "Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever." That Christ is "over all" is what is distinctly declared elsewhere by St. Paul, and <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., may be appended predicatively to denote his Divine essence. As to argument (3), it is necessary to exclude not only 2 Peter and Hebrews, but also 2 Timothy from the list of apostolical writings in order to give it any force. But even so it would be irrelevant; for the sentence before us is not a doxology, but an assertion: it is, according to the ancient interpretation, not "Blessed <span class="accented">be</span> Christ as God for ever;" but" Christ, who is God blessed for ever." The positive reasons for retaining the ancient interpretations may be stated as follows:  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[the people of]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#941;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#963;&#961;&#945;&#951;&#955;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Isra&#275;litai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2475.htm">Strong's 2475: </a> </span><span class="str2">An Israelite, one of the chosen people of Israel, a Jew.
