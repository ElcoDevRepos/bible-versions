In the early church, there was tension between Jewish and Gentile believers regarding dietary laws. Jewish Christians often adhered to Old Testament dietary restrictions, while Gentile Christians did not. Paul urges believers to focus on the greater mission of the church rather than allowing disputes over food to cause division. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, where He states that it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of it. The "work of God" refers to the building up of the church and the spread of the Gospel, which should not be hindered by secondary issues.<p><b>All food is clean,</b><br>This statement reflects the New Testament teaching that the dietary laws of the Old Testament are no longer binding on Christians. This was a significant shift from Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>, where Peter receives a vision declaring all foods clean. This change signifies the new covenant in Christ, where ceremonial laws are fulfilled and surpassed by the law of love and grace. It underscores the freedom believers have in Christ, as also discussed in <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4-5</a>, where Paul affirms that everything created by God is good and should be received with thanksgiving.<p><b>but it is wrong for a man to let his eating be a stumbling block.</b><br>Here, Paul addresses the responsibility of believers to consider the impact of their actions on others. While Christians have the freedom to eat all foods, they must be mindful of those who may have weaker consciences or different convictions. This principle of love and consideration is central to Christian ethics, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9-13</a>, where Paul discusses the importance of not causing a brother or sister to stumble. The term "stumbling block" refers to an obstacle that leads others into sin or confusion. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of self-sacrifice and putting others' needs above one's own, as exemplified by Christ in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-8</a>.<div
