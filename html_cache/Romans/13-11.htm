In the context of Paul's letter to the Romans, he is urging believers to live righteously and be aware of the spiritual and moral implications of their actions. The "occasion" refers to the eschatological expectation of Christ's return, a common theme in early Christian teachings. Understanding the times involves discerning the moral and spiritual climate and responding appropriately, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>, where the men of Issachar are praised for their understanding of the times.<p><b>The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber,</b><br>Paul uses the metaphor of waking from sleep to illustrate the need for spiritual vigilance and readiness. This imagery is consistent with other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>, which calls believers to rise from the dead and let Christ shine on them. The urgency of the message reflects the early Christian belief in the imminent return of Christ, encouraging believers to live in a state of preparedness and moral alertness. The call to wake up also suggests a transition from spiritual lethargy to active engagement in faith.<p><b>for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</b><br>This phrase highlights the progressive nature of salvation in Christian theology. While believers are justified at the moment of faith, the full realization of salvation, including glorification, is yet to come. The nearness of salvation refers to the anticipated return of Christ and the consummation of God's kingdom. This eschatological hope is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>, which encourages believers to gather together as they see the Day approaching. The phrase serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of earthly life and the eternal perspective that should guide Christian conduct.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the Christian believers in Rome, urging them to live in a manner that reflects their faith and the imminent return of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, they were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the capital of the Roman Empire, facing various challenges in practicing their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return_of_christ.htm">The Return of Christ</a></b><br>An anticipated future event in Christian eschatology, where Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, bringing final salvation to believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_the_times.htm">Awareness of the Times</a></b><br>Christians are called to be aware of the spiritual significance of the times they live in, recognizing the urgency of living out their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_wakefulness.htm">Spiritual Wakefulness</a></b><br>Believers must "wake up" from spiritual complacency, actively engaging in their faith and relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/imminence_of_salvation.htm">Imminence of Salvation</a></b><br>The nearness of salvation should motivate Christians to live holy and righteous lives, as the fulfillment of God's promises is closer than ever.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_faith.htm">Active Faith</a></b><br>Faith is not passive; it requires action and commitment, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel in daily life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ's_return.htm">Hope in Christ's Return</a></b><br>The anticipation of Christ's return provides hope and encouragement, urging believers to persevere in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_13_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 13:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_13_11_s_call_for_spiritual_urgency.htm">How does Romans 13:11 encourage urgency in our spiritual growth and actions?

This was in strict accordance with <a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>, and resulted naturally from the peculiar form of the Jewish Messianic expectation. A great shock had been given to the disciples by the crucifixion of Him whom they thought to be the Messiah, and though they began to recover from this as soon as they were convinced of His resurrection, they yet could not reconcile themselves to it entirely. The humiliation of the cross was still a stumbling-block to them <span class= "ital">taken alone,</span> but falling back upon another portion of their beliefs, they looked to see it supplemented, and its shameful side cancelled, by a second coming "in power and great glory." Their previous expectations, vague as they were, led them to regard this as part of the one manifestation of the Messiah, and they did not expect to see a long interval of time interposed.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">And that, knowing the time.</span>--And that there is all the more urgent motive for you to do--this law of love it is the more incumbent on you to practise--because you know what a critical moment it is in which you are living.

There can be little, if any, doubt that the apostle had in view the second coming of Christ, which he with others supposed might be close at hand, Our Lord had said that of that day none knew but the Father (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it would come unexpectedly (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27, 37-44</a>; <a href="/mark/13-36.htm">Mark 13:36</a>). Further, in the same addresses to the disciples before his death in which these things were said, he seems to have disclosed a vista of the future, after the manner of the ancient prophets, in which more immediate and more distant fulfilments of the prophetic vision were not clearly distinguished; so that words which we now perceive to have pointed to the destruction of Jerusalem, which was typical of the final judgments, might easily have been understood as referring to the latter. Such are, "This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled" (<a href="/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>; <a href="/mark/13-30.htm">Mark 13:30</a>; cf. also <a href="/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22, 23</a>). Hence it was natural that the apostolic Church should regard the second advent as probably imminent. We find in the apostolic Epistles several intimations of this expectation (cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2-5</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 28</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>); and though it was not realized in the event, the authority of the apostles as inspired teachers is not thus disparaged, this being the very thing which Christ had said must remain unknown to all. Nor does their teaching, enforced by this expectation, lose its force to us; for, though "the Lord delayeth his coming," and may still delay it, yet to each of us at least this present world is fast passing away, and the Lord may be close at hand to call us out of it. The duty of watchfulness and preparedness remains unchanged.
