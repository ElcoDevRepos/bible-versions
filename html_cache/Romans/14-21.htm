The early church was composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers, each with different backgrounds regarding food laws. Jewish Christians were accustomed to dietary restrictions from the Mosaic Law, while Gentile converts had no such traditions. Paul emphasizes that Christian liberty should not be exercised at the expense of another believer's conscience. This echoes the principle found in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>, where Paul states he would abstain from meat if it causes a brother to stumble. The focus is on love and unity within the body of Christ, prioritizing the spiritual well-being of others over personal freedom.<p><b>or drink wine</b><br>Wine was a common beverage in the ancient world, including among Jews and early Christians. However, its consumption could be a point of contention, especially if it led to drunkenness or if it was associated with pagan rituals. In the Roman context, wine was often used in religious ceremonies, which could cause issues for believers who had converted from paganism. Paul advises abstaining from wine if it might lead a fellow believer into sin or violate their conscience. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on avoiding drunkenness (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) and being mindful of the weaker brother's faith.<p><b>or to do anything</b><br>This phrase broadens the scope beyond just food and drink, encompassing any action that might lead another believer into sin. The principle here is one of self-sacrifice and consideration for others, reflecting the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> about not causing others to stumble. It underscores the importance of living a life that edifies others and promotes peace and harmony within the Christian community.<p><b>to cause your brother to stumble</b><br>The term "stumble" refers to causing another believer to fall into sin or to act against their conscience. In the cultural context of the early church, where diverse backgrounds and practices converged, the potential for causing offense was significant. Paul&#8217;s instruction is rooted in love and the desire to build up the church, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32-33</a>, where he advises believers to avoid giving offense to Jews, Greeks, or the church of God.

Meat itself is clean (<a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a>), yet consuming it can become hurtful if it troubles a fellow believer&#8217;s conscience.<p>&#8226; Choosing abstinence for another&#8217;s sake mirrors Christ&#8217;s self-denial in <a href="/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a>: &#8220;For even Christ did not please Himself.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

Paul extends the principle from disputed meats to any liberty, highlighting that even lawful pleasures may need to be laid aside for the spiritual health of others.<p>&#8226; By linking meat and wine, he covers both food and drink, showing the breadth of Christian responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or to do anything</b><p>The scope widens from specific items to every personal choice.<p>&#8226;
