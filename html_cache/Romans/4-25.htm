The term "delivered over" suggests a divine plan, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, which states it was the Lord's will to crush Him. The concept of substitutionary atonement is central here, where Jesus takes the place of sinners, bearing the punishment for humanity's sins. This is consistent with the Old Testament sacrificial system, where a spotless lamb was offered for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16). The phrase "for our trespasses" highlights the reason for His death&#8212;our sins, echoing <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, which states Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures. This underscores the gravity of sin and the necessity of a perfect sacrifice to restore the broken relationship between God and humanity.<p><b>and was raised to life for our justification</b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is pivotal in Christian theology, signifying victory over sin and death. The phrase "raised to life" confirms the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, which speak of the Messiah's triumph over the grave. This act validates Jesus' divine nature and His teachings, as He predicted His own resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). The term "for our justification" indicates that His resurrection is not just a demonstration of power but serves a purpose in the believer's salvation. Justification is a legal term, meaning to be declared righteous. <a href="/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18</a> further explains that through one act of righteousness, justification and life came to all men. The resurrection assures believers that their faith is not in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>) and that they are justified before God, having been acquitted of all charges due to Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this verse, whose death and resurrection are pivotal for Christian faith.

The atoning efficacy lay in His death, but the proof of that efficacy--the proof that it was really the Messiah who died--was to be seen in the Resurrection. The Resurrection, therefore, gave the greatest impulse to faith in the atoning efficacy of the death upon the cross, and in this way helped to bring about justification. Comp. especially <a href="/1_corinthians/15-17.htm" title="And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.">1Corinthians 15:17</a>, "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> you have no guarantee that your sins have really been remitted; if the death of Christ had not been followed by His resurrection, the inference would have followed that it was merely the death of an ordinary man, and without any special saving efficacy.<p>The distinction should be carefully observed between the bearing of these two acts, the death and the resurrection of Christ, on the doctrines of justification and sanctification respectively.
