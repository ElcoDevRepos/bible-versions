This faith is a model for believers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-12</a>, where Abraham's faith is commended. His faith did not falter even when faced with humanly insurmountable obstacles, reflecting the essence of true faith as described in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which is the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen.<p><b>He acknowledged the decrepitness of his body</b><br>Abraham's recognition of his own physical limitations underscores the miraculous nature of God's promise. At nearly a hundred years old, his body was naturally beyond the age of fathering children. This acknowledgment is not a sign of doubt but rather an honest assessment of his situation, which makes his faith even more remarkable. It parallels the human condition of recognizing our limitations and relying on divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, where God's power is made perfect in weakness.<p><b>(since he was about a hundred years old)</b><br>This detail emphasizes the improbability of Abraham fathering a child at such an advanced age, reinforcing the miraculous nature of Isaac's birth. <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a> records Abraham's initial reaction to God's promise, where he laughs at the idea of having a child at such an age. This historical context highlights the cultural understanding of old age and childbearing, making the fulfillment of God's promise even more significant.<p><b>And the lifelessness of Sarah&#8217;s womb</b><br>Sarah's barrenness is a recurring theme in the narrative of Abraham's life, first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>. Her inability to conceive is a significant obstacle to the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham a great nation. This situation sets the stage for God's intervention, demonstrating His power to bring life where there is none. It also serves as a type of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, where God brings about life in a miraculous way, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-34.htm">Luke 1:34-35</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Abraham is known as the father of faith. Despite his old age, he believed in God's promise that he would be the father of many nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>Abraham's wife, who was also advanced in age and had been barren. Her womb is described as "lifeless," highlighting the miraculous nature of God's promise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_god.htm">Promise of God</a></b><br>The event in focus is God's promise to Abraham that he would have a son and become the father of many nations, despite the apparent impossibility due to their old age.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_circumstances.htm">Faith Beyond Circumstances</a></b><br>Abraham's faith was not weakened by his physical circumstances.
