In the context of Romans, Paul is challenging the belief that adherence to the Mosaic Law is the path to becoming heirs of God's promises. Historically, the Jewish people were given the law at Mount Sinai, which became central to their identity and relationship with God. However, Paul argues that if inheritance were based solely on the law, it would exclude the necessity of faith. This connects to <a href="/galatians/3-18.htm">Galatians 3:18</a>, where Paul states that the inheritance comes by promise, not by law.<p><b>faith is useless</b><br>Here, Paul emphasizes the futility of faith if the law is the means to inheritance. Faith, in the biblical sense, is trust and reliance on God and His promises. If the law could secure the promises, then faith would have no role or purpose. This reflects the broader biblical narrative that faith has always been the means by which people are justified before God, as seen in the example of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where he believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.<p><b>and the promise is worthless</b><br>The promise refers to God's covenantal promises, particularly those made to Abraham regarding his descendants and the blessing to all nations. If the law were the means to obtain these promises, then the promise itself would be nullified, as it would depend on human effort rather than God's grace. This ties into the theme of grace versus works, a central tenet in Paul's letters, and is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which states that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works. The promise being worthless would contradict the nature of God's unchanging and faithful character, as seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the church in Rome, emphasizing the doctrine of justification by faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Central to Paul's argument in <a href="/bsb/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>, Abraham is presented as the exemplar of faith, being justified by faith before the law was given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to Israel, which Paul argues cannot be the basis for inheriting God's promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise.htm">The Promise</a></b><br>God's promise to Abraham and his descendants, which is received through faith, not by adherence to the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who needed clarification on the role of the law and faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_law.htm">Faith Over Law</a></b><br>Emphasize that faith, not adherence to the law, is the means by which we receive God's promises.

Faith and law cannot co-exist. They are the opposites of each other. The proper effect of law is punishment; for law only exposes sin. Faith, on the other hand, is the real key to the inheritance. It sets in motion grace; and grace, unlike law, excludes no one.
