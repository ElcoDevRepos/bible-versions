It emphasizes that the blessings of salvation are not limited to escaping wrath but extend to a deeper relationship with God.<p><b>but we also rejoice in God</b><br>Rejoicing in God signifies a profound joy and satisfaction found in a relationship with Him. This joy is not based on circumstances but on the assurance of salvation and the character of God. The concept of rejoicing in God is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, where believers are encouraged to "rejoice in the Lord always."<p><b>through our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase underscores the centrality of Jesus Christ in the believer's relationship with God. Jesus is the mediator who makes reconciliation possible. The title "Lord" affirms His divinity and authority, while "Jesus Christ" acknowledges His role as the Messiah. This is consistent with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way to the Father.<p><b>through whom we have now received reconciliation</b><br>Reconciliation refers to the restoration of a broken relationship between humanity and God, made possible through Jesus' sacrificial death.
