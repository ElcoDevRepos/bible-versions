This practice is evident in several New Testament references, such as <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a> and <a href="/colossians/4-15.htm">Colossians 4:15</a>. The house church mentioned here likely belonged to Priscilla and Aquila, a prominent Christian couple who played a significant role in the early church (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>). This setting reflects the intimate and communal nature of early Christian worship, emphasizing fellowship and shared resources. Archaeological findings in regions like Ephesus and Corinth have uncovered homes with large rooms that could accommodate gatherings, supporting the historical context of house churches.<p><b>Greet my beloved Epenetus,</b><br>Epenetus is described with affection by Paul, indicating a close personal relationship. The term "beloved" suggests a deep bond, possibly due to shared ministry or significant contributions to the church. This personal greeting highlights the importance of individual relationships within the body of Christ, as seen in other Pauline letters where he often names and commends specific individuals (<a href="/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25-30</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7-14</a>). Epenetus's mention underscores the value of each member in the early church community, regardless of their role or status.<p><b>who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</b><br>Epenetus holds the distinction of being the first convert in the Roman province of Asia, which included cities like Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamum. This region was a significant center for early Christian evangelism, as evidenced by Paul's missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>). The conversion of Epenetus marks the beginning of the spread of Christianity in Asia Minor, a fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). His conversion can be seen as a type of firstfruits, a concept rooted in Old Testament offerings (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>), symbolizing the initial yield of a larger harvest to come. This aligns with the prophetic vision of the gospel reaching the ends of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_at_their_house.htm">The Church at Their House</a></b><br>This refers to a group of believers who gathered in a private home for worship and fellowship.
