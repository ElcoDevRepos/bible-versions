Macedonia included cities like Philippi and Thessalonica, while Achaia encompassed cities such as Corinth. These regions were significant centers of early Christianity, and the churches there were established by Paul during his missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10, 18</a>:1). The mention of these regions highlights the unity and cooperation among the early Christian communities, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries.<p><b>were pleased to make a contribution</b><br>The phrase indicates a voluntary and joyful act of giving. The Greek word used here suggests a willingness and eagerness to help. This reflects the Christian principle of generosity and the teaching of Jesus about giving (<a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>). The act of contributing was not out of obligation but out of love and solidarity with fellow believers, demonstrating the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><b>for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem</b><br>The early church in Jerusalem faced significant economic hardships, partly due to persecution and possibly a famine (<a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28-30</a>).

The collection for the poor in Jerusalem is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/1_corinthians/16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-3</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8-9</a>), showing the interconnectedness of the early church.

Still from the first it would seem as if persons like Joseph of Arimathaea, and Nicodemus, and Mary the mother of Mark, were exceptions, and we know that the church at Jerusalem suffered severely during the famine in the reign of Claudius. Wealthier churches, such as those of Macedonia and Greece, would naturally be glad to have the opportunity of sending relief to the mother church, from which they might be said to be derived themselves. St. Paul himself proceeds to urge this very argument. From Jerusalem went forth the gospel which had been preached in Greece and Macedonia, and it would be but a small and due return if some of the superfluous wealth of those more favoured regions found its way to Jerusalem.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
