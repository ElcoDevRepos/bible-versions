It underscores the authority of Scripture and Paul's reliance on it to make his theological points. This phrase often introduces a quotation from the Old Testament, emphasizing the consistency of God's message throughout history.<p><b>God gave them a spirit of stupor,</b><br>This phrase refers to a divine judgment where God allows a hardening of hearts. The "spirit of stupor" suggests a state of spiritual insensitivity or dullness. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, particularly in <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, where God is described as pouring out a deep sleep on the people. It highlights the seriousness of rejecting God's revelation and the consequences that follow.<p><b>eyes that could not see,</b><br>This imagery of blindness is frequently used in the Bible to describe spiritual blindness or the inability to perceive spiritual truths. It connects to passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet is told that the people will be ever seeing but never understanding. This blindness is not physical but spiritual, indicating a lack of understanding or acceptance of God's message.<p><b>and ears that could not hear,</b><br>Similar to the imagery of blindness, deafness in the Bible often symbolizes a refusal or inability to hear God's word. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/29-4.htm">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>, where Moses tells the Israelites that despite witnessing God's miracles, they have not been given a heart to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear. It underscores the theme of spiritual insensitivity and the need for divine intervention to truly understand God's will.<p><b>to this very day.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ongoing nature of this condition among the people Paul is addressing. It suggests that the spiritual blindness and deafness are not just historical issues but continue to be relevant. This continuity serves as a warning and a call to repentance, highlighting the persistent need for spiritual awakening and the acceptance of God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome about the spiritual state of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom God originally gave His law and promises, yet many of whom have rejected the Messiah, Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign being who, according to His divine plan, has allowed a partial hardening of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_isaiah_and_david.htm">Prophets Isaiah and David</a></b><br>Old Testament figures whose writings Paul references to explain Israel's spiritual condition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_blindness.htm">Understanding Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Recognize that spiritual blindness is a condition allowed by God as part of His sovereign plan.

Etymologically, the word translated "slumber" would seem to agree better with the marginal rendering, "remorse." It comes from a root meaning to "prick or cut with a sharp instrument." There happens to be another root somewhat similar, but certainly not connected, which means "drowsiness," "slumber." Hence, where the word in the text has been used to render the Hebrew word for "slumber," it has been thought that there was a confusion between the two. It appears, however, from the LXX. usage, that the sense of "slumber" had certainly come to attach to the word here used by St. Paul. From the notion of a sharp wound or blow came to be derived that of the bewilderment or stupefaction consequent upon such a blow, and hence it came to signify stupor in general.<p>The quotation is a free combination of two passages of the LXX. (<a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm" title="For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.">Isaiah 29:10</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/29-4.htm" title="Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>), no doubt put together by the Apostle from memory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According as it is written, God gave them a spirit of slumber</span> (rather, <span class="accented">stupor.</span> The word is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, cited from <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a> in the LXX.

It is from the verb which means <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, properly "to prick" (see <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>).

And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompense unto them. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway</span>. The references in ver. 8 are a combination of <a href="/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, quoted freely from the LXX.; that in ver. 9 is to <a href="/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23, 24</a>, also quoted freely. (For similar combination and free quotation of texts, so as to bring out Old Testament ideas, cf. <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-19</a>; <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32, 33</a>.) It is not necessary that the passages here referred to should be regarded as directly prophetic of the time of Christ. It is enough for the purpose of the argument that God's people should be shown to be liable to the state of stupefaction described, without ceasing to be his people. And so the thought, which has been in view all along, is now taken up, of the present hardening of Israel as a nation not being intended to be permanent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
