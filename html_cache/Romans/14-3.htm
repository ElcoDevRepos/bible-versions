Jewish Christians often adhered to dietary laws from the Old Testament, while Gentile converts did not. This phrase addresses the potential for division within the church over such practices. The term "belittle" suggests a condescending attitude, which is contrary to the unity and love that should characterize the body of Christ. This echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-2</a> about not judging others, and it aligns with the call for humility and acceptance found in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>.<p><b>and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to those who might hold stricter dietary practices, cautioning them against judging those with more freedom in their eating habits. The historical context includes the Jewish dietary laws found in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which were deeply ingrained in Jewish culture. The early church faced challenges as it integrated Gentile believers who did not follow these laws. This instruction promotes mutual respect and understanding, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>, where Peter is told in a vision that what God has made clean should not be called impure.<p><b>for God has accepted him</b><br>The acceptance by God is the ultimate standard for Christian fellowship. This phrase emphasizes that dietary practices do not determine one's standing before God. It reflects the broader theological theme of justification by faith, as outlined in <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>. The acceptance of both groups by God is a call to unity, reminding believers that their identity in Christ transcends cultural and ritualistic differences. This acceptance is rooted in the work of Christ, who fulfilled the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and brought together Jews and Gentiles into one body (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the church in Rome, which was composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>A diverse congregation in Rome, consisting of believers from different backgrounds, including those who observed Jewish dietary laws and those who did not.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_and_gentile_believers.htm">Jewish and Gentile Believers</a></b><br>The two primary groups within the early church, often with differing views on dietary laws and other cultural practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dietary_practices.htm">Dietary Practices</a></b><br>The specific issue being addressed, where some believers felt free to eat all foods, while others adhered to dietary restrictions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_acceptance.htm">God's Acceptance</a></b><br>The central theme of the verse, emphasizing that God accepts both those who eat everything and those who do not.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The church is called to embrace diversity in non-essential matters, recognizing that God accepts all believers regardless of their dietary practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_judgment.htm">Avoiding Judgment</a></b><br>Believers should refrain from judging one another over disputable matters, focusing instead on mutual acceptance and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respecting_conscience.htm">Respecting Conscience</a></b><br>Each believer must be fully convinced in their own mind and respect the conscience of others, understanding that God is the ultimate judge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_acceptance.htm">God's Acceptance</a></b><br>Our acceptance by God is not based on external practices but on faith in Christ.
