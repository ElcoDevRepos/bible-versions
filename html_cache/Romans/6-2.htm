It reflects Paul's emphatic denial of the notion that grace might encourage sinful behavior. The Greek phrase "m&#275; genoito" is often translated as "God forbid" or "By no means," indicating a vehement opposition. This reflects the seriousness with which Paul addresses the issue of sin in the life of a believer, emphasizing that grace is not a license to sin.<p><b>How can we who died to sin</b><br>The concept of dying to sin is central to Paul's theology. It signifies a definitive break from the power and dominion of sin, achieved through union with Christ in His death and resurrection. This is a spiritual reality for believers, symbolized in baptism (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). The idea of dying to sin is also connected to the broader biblical narrative of transformation and renewal, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, where believers are described as new creations in Christ.<p><b>live in it any longer?</b><br>Living in sin implies a habitual, ongoing practice of sinning, which is incompatible with the new life in Christ. The rhetorical question underscores the absurdity of continuing in sin after having been set free from its power. This aligns with the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, where believers are urged to be holy as God is holy. The transformation expected of believers is a reflection of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, who empowers them to live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, providing theological insights and practical guidance for living a Christian life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, they were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire, facing various cultural and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>A central theme in this passage, sin is personified as a power or force from which believers have been set free through Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death_to_sin.htm">Death to Sin</a></b><br>A metaphorical event that occurs when a believer accepts Christ, symbolizing a break from the power and dominion of sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_life_in_christ.htm">New Life in Christ</a></b><br>The event and process of living a transformed life through the power of the Holy Spirit, as believers are called to walk in newness of life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_christ.htm">Understanding Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we must recognize that our identity is now in Christ, and we are no longer slaves to sin.

His immediate response is an emphatic refusal: &#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase is the same forceful denial found elsewhere (<a href="/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>; 6:15; <a href="/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a>), underscoring that any suggestion of using grace as a license for sin is utterly foreign to the gospel.<p>&#8211; Scripture consistently teaches that forgiveness does not void God&#8217;s moral standards (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>; <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a>).

John makes a similar appeal: &#8220;No one who abides in Him keeps on sinning&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Peter uses the same logic: after being rescued, &#8220;How is it that you return to the same flood of debauchery?&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8211; The question invites believers to think, not excuse themselves. A changed position before God must lead to a changed practice before the world (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We who died to sin</b><p>&#8211; At conversion we were united with Christ in His death (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>).

"St. Paul regards this change--from sin to righteousness, from bondage to freedom, from death to life--as summed up in one definite act of the past; potentially to all men in our Lord's passion and resurrection, actually to each individual man when he accepts Christ, is baptised into Christ. Then he is made righteous by being incorporated into Christ's righteousness, he dies once for all to sin, he lives henceforth for ever to God. This is his <span class= "ital">ideal.</span> Practically, we know that the death to sin and the life to righteousness are inchoate, imperfect, gradual, meagerly realised even by the most saintly men in this life; but St. Paul sets the matter in this ideal light to force upon the consciences of his hearers the fact that an entire change came over them when they became Christians--that the knowledge and the grace then vouchsafed to them did not leave them where they were--that they are not, and cannot be, their former selves--and that it is a contradiction of their very being to sin any more. It is the definiteness, the absoluteness of this change, considered as an historical crisis, which forms the central idea of St. Paul's teaching, and which the aorist marks. We cannot, therefore, afford to obscure this idea by disregarding the distinctions of grammar; yet in our English version it is a mere chance whether in such cases the aorist is translated as an aorist" (<span class= "ital">On Revision,</span> p. 85). These remarks will form the best possible commentary upon the passage before us. It may be only well to add that the change between the position of the first Christians and our own involves a certain change in the application of what was originally said with reference to them. Baptism is not now the tremendous crisis that it was then. The ideal of Christian life then assumed is more distinctly an ideal. It has a much less definite hold upon the imagination and the will. But it ought not therefore to be any the less binding upon the Christian. He should work <span class= "ital">towards</span> it, if he cannot work <span class= "ital">from</span> it, in the spirit of <a href="/context/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12-14</a>.<p>It would be well for the reader to note at once the corrections suggested in the rendering of this verse by Dr. Lightfoot's criticism:--In <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>, "we <span class= "ital">were</span> buried" for "we are buried;" in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>, "the old man <span class= "ital">was</span> crucified" for "is crucified;" in <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>, "if we <span class= "ital">died</span>" for "if we be dead."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>: St. Paul's usual way of rejecting an idea indignantly). <span class="cmt_word">We who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, with its proper meaning of <span class="accented">being such as</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>died</span> (not, as in the Authorized Version, "are dead."
