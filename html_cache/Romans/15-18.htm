This reflects the biblical principle that all glory belongs to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>). Paul&#8217;s ministry to the Gentiles was a fulfillment of his calling as an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of divine empowerment in Christian service, aligning with Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a> that apart from Him, believers can do nothing.<p><b>in leading the Gentiles to obedience</b><br>Paul&#8217;s mission was to bring the Gentiles to faith and obedience, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The term "obedience" here implies not just belief but a life transformed by faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>, where Paul speaks of bringing about the "obedience of faith." This reflects the early church's expansion beyond Jewish boundaries, a significant cultural and theological shift, as the Gentiles were historically seen as outside God&#8217;s covenant people (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>by word and deed</b><br>Paul&#8217;s ministry was characterized by both proclamation and action. His preaching (word) was accompanied by a lifestyle and works (deed) that validated his message. This dual approach is consistent with <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which emphasizes that faith without works is dead. Paul&#8217;s deeds included miracles and acts of service, which served as signs of the Kingdom of God and authenticated his apostolic authority (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>).

Instead of saying, "I will confine myself to what Christ <span class= "ital">has</span> wrought by me," he says, "I will <span class= "ital">not</span> speak of what Christ has <span class= "ital">not</span> wrought by me," though the description which follows is that of his own ministry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought through me unto the obedience of the Gentiles (meaning, I will not dare to speak, of any mere doings of my own, but only of those in which the power of Christ working through my ministry has been displayed) <span class="cmt_word">by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> displays of miraculous power. It is noteworthy how St. Paul alludes incidentally in his letters to such "signs and wonders" having accompanied his ministry, as to something familiar and acknowledged, so as to suggest the idea of their having been more frequent than we might gather from the Acts of the Apostles. Had the alleged "signs and wonders" been unreal, we might have expected them to be made more of in the subsequent narrative of an admirer than in contemporary letters), <span class="cmt_word">by the power of the Spirit of God</span> (al. <span class="accented">the Holy Spirit.</span> This power, if taken as distinct from that of <span class="accented">signs and wonders</span>, may denote the power of the Holy Spirit displayed in the conversion of believers, and the gifts bestowed upon them); <span class="cmt_word">so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached</span> (literally, <span class="accented">I have fulfilled</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the gospel of Christ</span>. In thus designating the sphere of his ministry the apostle is denoting its local extent, rather than the course he had taken. He had, in fact, preached first at Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>), and afterwards at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29</a>); but he mentions Jerusalem first, as being the original home of the gospel in the East, and, indeed, the first scene of his own preaching in fellowship with the original apostles. Thence he had extended it in various quarters (for the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> - trans. "round about" - cf. <a href="/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12</a>), and carried it into Europe, Illyricum being the western limit so far reached. It is true that there is no mention in the Acts of his having actually visited Illyria. In the journey of <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>. he plainly got no further west than Betted, which is, however, not far off; and he might possibly mean here only to say that he had extended the gospel to the borders of Illyricum, but for the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and his seeming to imply afterwards (ver. 23) that he had gone as far as he could in those regions, and consequently contemplated a journey to Spain. Hence, the narrative of Acts not being an exhaustive history, it may be supposed that he had on some occasion extended his operations from Macedonia to Illyricum, as he may well have done on his visit to the latter mentioned in <a href="/acts/20-1.htm">Acts 20:1-3</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> allows for a visit into Illyricum. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/15-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I will not presume</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#955;&#956;&#942;&#963;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(tolm&#275;s&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5111.htm">Strong's 5111: </a> </span><span class="str2">To dare, endure, be bold, have courage, make up the mind.
