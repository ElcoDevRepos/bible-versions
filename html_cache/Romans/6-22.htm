In the context of Romans, Paul contrasts the believer's past enslavement to sin with their new freedom. This freedom is not merely a release from guilt but a liberation from the power and dominion of sin. The concept of being "set free" echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>, "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." Historically, the Roman audience would understand the significance of freedom, as slavery was a common institution in their society. This freedom is a spiritual emancipation, signifying a break from the bondage of sin that once controlled their lives.<p><b>and have become slaves to God</b><br>The paradox of being "slaves to God" emphasizes total devotion and submission to God's will. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, slavery was a familiar concept, and Paul uses it to illustrate the believer's new allegiance. Unlike the oppressive slavery to sin, being a slave to God is a position of honor and purpose. This servitude leads to true freedom, as it aligns with God's righteous and loving nature. The imagery of slavery to God is also seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>, where Paul states, "For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord."<p><b>the fruit you reap leads to holiness</b><br>The "fruit" signifies the visible outcomes or results of a life dedicated to God. In biblical terms, fruit often represents the evidence of one's spiritual condition (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>). Holiness, or sanctification, is the process of becoming more like Christ, set apart for God's purposes. This transformation is ongoing and is a work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life. The agricultural metaphor of reaping fruit would resonate with Paul's audience, who were familiar with farming practices. This process of bearing fruit is also discussed in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruit of the Spirit is listed.<p><b>and the outcome is eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is the ultimate promise and hope for believers. It is not just an unending existence but a quality of life that begins now and continues forever in the presence of God. This assurance of eternal life is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life." The outcome of a life lived in holiness and submission to God is this eternal reward, contrasting with the wages of sin, which is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). This promise of eternal life fulfills the prophecies and covenants of the Old Testament, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>A central theme in Romans, representing the moral failing and separation from God that humanity experiences.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and the one to whom believers are now enslaved, in contrast to their former enslavement to sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The ultimate outcome and promise for believers who live in holiness and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_from_sin.htm">Freedom from Sin</a></b><br>Believers are no longer under the dominion of sin.
