The concept of sin taking an opportunity suggests that sin exploits the law to provoke disobedience. This reflects the idea that the law, while holy and good, can be manipulated by sin to incite rebellion. This echoes <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where the serpent uses God's command to deceive Eve. The law, intended to guide, becomes a tool for sin to exert its influence, highlighting human nature's tendency to rebel against restrictions.<p><b>deceived me</b><br>The deception here is reminiscent of the serpent's deception of Eve in the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>). Sin's deceitfulness lies in its ability to make the forbidden seem desirable, promising life but delivering death. This deception is a recurring theme in Scripture, warning believers of sin's cunning nature (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>). The law, meant to reveal sin, becomes a means by which sin tricks individuals into transgression, illustrating the need for discernment and reliance on God's wisdom.<p><b>and through the commandment put me to death</b><br>The phrase "put me to death" signifies the spiritual death that results from sin. <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> states, "For the wages of sin is death," underscoring the fatal consequence of sin. The commandment, while good, exposes sin, and without the redemptive work of Christ, leads to condemnation. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of the law's inability to save, pointing to the necessity of Jesus' sacrifice for salvation. The law reveals sin but cannot redeem, emphasizing the need for grace through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman Christians, explaining the relationship between the law and sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>Personified in this passage, sin is depicted as an active force that uses the law to deceive and bring about spiritual death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites.

Yet this grim diagnosis drives us to the Savior who fulfills the law, breaks sin&#8217;s power, and grants life to all who trust Him (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1&#8211;2</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11-13) The cause of this miscarriage lay not with the Law but with Sin.
