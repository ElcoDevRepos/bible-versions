Paul is referencing <a href="/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>, emphasizing the accessibility and clarity of God's word. This approach is typical of Jewish rabbinical teaching, where questions are used to engage the audience and lead them to deeper understanding.<p><b>&#8220;The word is near you;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the immediacy and accessibility of God's message. In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses was assuring the Israelites that God's commandments were not beyond their reach. Paul uses this to illustrate that the message of salvation through faith in Christ is readily available to all, not requiring extraordinary efforts to obtain.<p><b>it is in your mouth and in your heart,&#8221;</b><br>The dual location of the word&#8212;in the mouth and heart&#8212;suggests both confession and belief. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>), where God's commandments are to be internalized and spoken. The heart represents the center of one's being, while the mouth signifies the outward expression of faith. This connection is further emphasized in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>, where confession and belief are linked to salvation.<p><b>that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:</b><br>Paul clarifies that the "word" he refers to is the gospel message he and others are preaching. This "word of faith" is the good news of Jesus Christ, which fulfills the law and prophets. The proclamation of this message is central to the mission of the early church, as seen in Acts and the epistles. It underscores the transition from the law to grace, emphasizing faith in Christ as the means of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome to explain the righteousness that comes from faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who are being instructed in the faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Referenced indirectly through the quotation from <a href="/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>, which Paul uses to illustrate the accessibility of God's word.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the original message in Deuteronomy was given, representing God's chosen people and their relationship with His word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_faith.htm">The Word of Faith</a></b><br>The central theme of the passage, referring to the message of the Gospel that Paul and others are preaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_accessibility_of_god's_word.htm">The Accessibility of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is not distant or unreachable; it is near and accessible to all who seek it.
