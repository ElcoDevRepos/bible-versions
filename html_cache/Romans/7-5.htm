In biblical context, "flesh" often symbolizes human weakness and propensity to sin (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>). Theologically, it contrasts with living according to the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-9</a>). Historically, this reflects the human condition post-Fall, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where humanity's disobedience led to a life dominated by sin.<p><b>the sinful passions aroused by the law</b><br>Here, "sinful passions" are the desires that lead to sin. The law, while holy and good (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), paradoxically highlights sin by defining it (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). This phrase suggests that the law, by prohibiting certain actions, can inadvertently provoke sinful desires, a concept Paul elaborates on in <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-8</a>. This reflects the human tendency to rebel against restrictions, a theme seen throughout Israel's history (Exodus 32).<p><b>were at work in our bodies</b><br>This indicates the active presence of sin within human nature, affecting physical actions and decisions. The "bodies" here symbolize the whole person, emphasizing that sin impacts every aspect of human life. This aligns with Paul's teaching in <a href="/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12-13</a>, where he warns against letting sin reign in mortal bodies. Theologically, it underscores the need for redemption and transformation through Christ.<p><b>bearing fruit for death</b><br>The metaphor of "bearing fruit" suggests outcomes or consequences. In this context, the result of living according to the flesh is spiritual death, as opposed to the life-giving fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). This echoes the warning in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> that the wages of sin is death. It highlights the ultimate consequence of sin, reinforcing the necessity of salvation through Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman Christians, explaining the relationship between the law, sin, and grace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites and is central to understanding sin and righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinful_passions.htm">Sinful Passions</a></b><br>The desires and inclinations that lead individuals away from God's will, often exacerbated by the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Represents spiritual death, the ultimate consequence of living in sin and apart from God's grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_role_of_the_law.htm">Understanding the Role of the Law</a></b><br>The law reveals sin but does not have the power to save.

Before that mortification of the flesh which proceeds from our relation to the death of Christ, we bore a fruit generated through our carnal appetites by the Law, and the only being to whose honour and glory they contributed was Death.<p>The sins committed under the old dispensation are regarded as due to a two-fold agency--on the one hand to the Law (the operation of which is described more particularly in <a href="/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7-8</a>), and on the other hand to the flesh, which was only too susceptible to any influence that would call out its sinful impulses. Those impulses have now been mortified, as if by a course of asceticism, through union with the death of Christ.<p>The "body" is regarded by St. Paul as a neutral principle, which is not in itself either good or bad. It is simply the material frame of men, which though itself "of the earth earthy" is capable of becoming a dwelling-place for the Spirit, and being put to holy uses. The "flesh" is the same material frame regarded as the seat of sinful appetites, and with a tendency to obey the lower rather than the higher self.
