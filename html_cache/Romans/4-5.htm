In the context of Paul's letter to the Romans, he is addressing the Jewish understanding of the law and works as a means to righteousness. The idea that righteousness can be obtained without works was revolutionary, challenging the prevailing Jewish belief that adherence to the law was necessary for justification. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which states that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works.<p><b>but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly</b><br>The focus here is on faith in God, who justifies the ungodly. This is a radical statement, as it suggests that God declares the unrighteous as righteous through faith. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). The term "ungodly" underscores the idea that God's grace is extended to those who are not inherently righteous, highlighting the transformative power of faith in Christ.<p><b>his faith is credited as righteousness</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the doctrine of imputed righteousness, where faith is counted as righteousness. This is a key tenet of Christian theology, emphasizing that righteousness is not earned but granted by God through faith. This concept is further supported by <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, which speaks of Christ becoming sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God. The use of the term "credited" suggests a legal or accounting metaphor, indicating that righteousness is accounted to the believer's "ledger" through faith, not through personal merit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Abraham is a central figure in <a href="/bsb/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>.
