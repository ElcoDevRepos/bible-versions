Throughout the Old Testament, prophets were often persecuted and killed for delivering God's messages, as seen in the cases of prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>) and Zechariah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>). This highlights the spiritual rebellion and hardness of heart that plagued Israel, a theme that is echoed in Jesus' lament over Jerusalem in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>. The killing of prophets serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of speaking truth in a world resistant to God's word.<p><b>and torn down Your altars.</b><br>The destruction of altars signifies a rejection of true worship and a turning away from God. In the Old Testament, altars were central to worship and sacrifice, representing a place of communion with God (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The tearing down of altars indicates a deliberate move towards idolatry and false worship, as seen in the actions of kings like Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>). This act of desecration underscores the spiritual apostasy that Elijah confronted during his ministry, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>.<p><b>I am the only one left,</b><br>Elijah's lament of being the sole remaining prophet reflects his deep sense of isolation and despair. This feeling of being alone in faith is a common experience for those who stand for God in hostile environments. However, God reassures Elijah that he is not alone, revealing that there are still 7,000 in Israel who have not bowed to Baal (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). This serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the remnant He preserves, a theme Paul emphasizes in <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>.<p><b>and they are seeking my life as well&#8221;?</b><br>Elijah's fear for his life is rooted in the intense persecution he faced from Jezebel and Ahab, who sought to kill him after his victory over the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19:1-2</a>). This pursuit of Elijah's life illustrates the cost of prophetic ministry and the reality of spiritual warfare. It also foreshadows the persecution faced by Jesus and His followers, as Jesus warned in <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>. Elijah's experience is a type of Christ, who was also rejected and pursued unto death, yet ultimately victorious.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who felt isolated and threatened by the Israelites' rebellion against God.

Elijah&#8217;s cry begins by addressing God personally: &#8220;Lord.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The appeal is made to the covenant-keeping God who hears and answers (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Paul&#8217;s citation of Elijah&#8217;s prayer (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>) reminds us that the entire drama is lived out before a sovereign Lord who remains on the throne (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>).<p>&#8211; By retaining the direct address, Paul underscores that Israel&#8217;s story&#8212;and ours&#8212;must be brought to God first, not merely analyzed by human wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they have killed Your prophets</b><p>&#8211; Elijah laments that God&#8217;s spokesmen have been silenced: &#8220;they have killed Your prophets.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a> describes how &#8220;they mocked God&#8217;s messengers, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes the charge in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>, &#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The statement is historically literal: under Ahab and Jezebel, many prophets really were executed (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Spiritually, it shows how hardened hearts fight the very voice meant to save them (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul&#8217;s point in <a href="/bsb/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a> is that this hostility did not annul God&#8217;s plan; He preserved a remnant then, and He preserves one now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and torn down Your altars</b><p>&#8211; Altars marked places of true worship (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>;

Destroying them was an attempt to erase God&#8217;s presence from the land.<p>&#8211; <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-5</a> records similar desecration in Manasseh&#8217;s day.<p>&#8211; Even when visible reminders of faith are demolished, God Himself endures (<a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-27</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul wants his readers to see that apostasy may appear overwhelming, yet it never empties God&#8217;s plan of power (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, &#8220;So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am the only one left</b><p>&#8211; Elijah felt utterly alone: &#8220;I alone am left&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Our emotions can mislead us, but God corrects our perspective. He told Elijah, &#8220;Yet I have reserved seven thousand&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul uses this to reassure Jewish and Gentile believers alike that God always keeps a faithful core, even when culture looks bankrupt (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Application: personal isolation does not equal divine abandonment (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>, &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they are seeking my life as well</b><p>&#8211; Jezebel swore to kill Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>).

What can man do to me?&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Paul had faced similar danger (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-13</a>) yet trusted God&#8217;s preservation.<p>&#8211; For believers today, the verse reminds us that hostility may continue, but God&#8217;s secure plan remains (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/11-3.htm">Romans 11:3</a>, quoting Elijah, expresses a prophet&#8217;s honest despair in the face of national apostasy and personal danger.
