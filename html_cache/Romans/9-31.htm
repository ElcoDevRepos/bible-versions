In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing the nation of Israel, which had a special covenant relationship with God. Historically, Israel was chosen to be God's people, receiving the Law through Moses at Mount Sinai. This covenant relationship is central to understanding Israel's pursuit of righteousness. The nation of Israel is often seen as a type of the Church, with its history serving as a foreshadowing of the spiritual journey of believers.<p><b>who pursued a law of righteousness</b><br>The phrase "pursued a law of righteousness" indicates Israel's attempt to achieve righteousness through adherence to the Mosaic Law. The Law, given in the Old Testament, was intended to guide Israel in living a life pleasing to God. However, the Law also highlighted human inability to achieve perfect righteousness on their own. This pursuit reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of the Law, which was to point to the need for a Savior. The pursuit of righteousness through the Law is contrasted with the righteousness that comes by faith, as seen in the lives of Abraham and other patriarchs.<p><b>has not attained it</b><br>Despite their efforts, Israel did not attain the righteousness they sought. This failure is not due to the Law itself but to the reliance on human effort rather than faith. The concept of attaining righteousness is central to Paul's argument in Romans, where he emphasizes that true righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not through works of the Law. This echoes the prophetic writings, such as <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, which declare that human righteousness is like "filthy rags" before God. The inability to attain righteousness through the Law underscores the necessity of Christ's atoning sacrifice, fulfilling the Law and providing the means for true righteousness through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who were given the Law through Moses and sought righteousness through adherence to it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>The Mosaic Law, which includes the commandments and ordinances given to Israel, intended to guide them in righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness.htm">Righteousness</a></b><br>The state of being morally right or justifiable, which Israel sought through the Law but did not achieve.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitation_of_the_law.htm">The Limitation of the Law</a></b><br>The Law was never intended to be the ultimate means of achieving righteousness.
