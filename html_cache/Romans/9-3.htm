This echoes Moses' intercession for Israel in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>, where he offers to be blotted out of God's book for the people's sake. Theologically, it highlights the sacrificial love that mirrors Christ's own sacrifice. The concept of being "cursed" and "cut off" is significant in Jewish thought, often associated with being outside the covenant community, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, where a hanged man is considered cursed by God.<p><b>for the sake of my brothers,</b><br>The term "brothers" here refers to the speaker's fellow Israelites, emphasizing a familial bond. This reflects the strong sense of community and identity within the Jewish people, who are bound by shared ancestry and covenant with God. The speaker's willingness to sacrifice for his "brothers" underscores the importance of kinship and loyalty, which are central themes in the Hebrew Scriptures, as seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers in Genesis.<p><b>my own flesh and blood,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical and ethnic connection to the people being referred to. It highlights the speaker's deep personal connection and responsibility towards his fellow Jews. The use of "flesh and blood" underscores the humanity and shared heritage, reminiscent of the covenantal promises made to Abraham and his descendants in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>. This connection is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus' genealogy is traced to emphasize His fulfillment of the promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

could wish</b><p>Paul opens with a startling admission of personal desire&#8212;&#8220;For I could wish.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;He is not stating a doctrinal possibility but revealing the depth of his heart.<p>&#8226;&#8194;Cross reference: In <a href="/romans/10-1.htm">Romans 10:1</a> he says, &#8220;Brothers, my heart&#8217;s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is for their salvation,&#8221; showing consistency in yearning for his people.<p>&#8226;&#8194;This echoes Moses&#8217; plea, &#8220;Yet now, if You would only forgive their sin&#8212;but if not, please blot me out of the book You have written&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>), underscoring a long-standing biblical pattern: God&#8217;s servants often express willingness to suffer for others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I myself</b><p>Paul emphasizes personal involvement&#8212;&#8220;that I myself.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;The repetition underscores sincerity; it is not a theoretical statement about &#8220;someone else.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;<a href="/2_corinthians/12-15.htm">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>: &#8220;So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s ministry is consistently self-sacrificial.<p>&#8226;&#8194;His use of &#8220;myself&#8221; signals ownership of the burden, not delegation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were cursed and cut off from Christ</b><p>Here Paul ventures into the unimaginable: being &#8220;cursed and cut off from Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> states, &#8220;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us.&#8221; Paul is willing, hypothetically, to undergo what Christ has already borne.<p>&#8226;&#8194;This mirrors <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>: &#8220;Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;Important clarity: Paul knows such self-substitution is impossible&#8212;only Christ can bear the curse&#8212;but the statement reveals the extreme measure of love in his heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the sake of my brothers</b><p>His motive is explicit: &#8220;for the sake of my brothers.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a> notes their zeal without knowledge; Paul longs to bridge that gap.<p>&#8226;&#8194;<a href="/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1&#8211;5</a> demonstrates his kinship and shared history with them, enhancing the authenticity of his concern.<p>&#8226;&#8194;The phrase reveals missionary passion: personal loss counted acceptable if it meant corporate gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my own flesh and blood</b><p>Paul identifies these brothers as literal Israelites&#8212;&#8220;my own flesh and blood.&#8221;<p>&#8226;&#8194;He stresses lineage, not merely spiritual kinship (cf. <a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a>, &#8220;I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham&#8221;).<p>&#8226;&#8194;<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4&#8211;5</a> lists his credentials, showing his deep ties to Israel.<p>&#8226;&#8194;Yet <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a> will clarify that true Israel also involves those of faith, blending physical and spiritual realities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a> exposes Paul&#8217;s profound, Christ-like love: he is willing, in theory, to accept personal damnation if it would rescue his fellow Israelites. While such a trade is impossible&#8212;salvation rests solely on Christ&#8217;s finished work&#8212;the verse highlights the apostle&#8217;s sacrificial heart, echoing Moses&#8217; intercession and Christ&#8217;s own substitutionary love. It challenges believers to cultivate a compassion so intense that personal comfort becomes secondary to the eternal well-being of others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I could wish</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">I could have wished.</span> The wish, of course, related to what was really impossible.
