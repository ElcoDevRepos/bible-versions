In biblical times, olive trees were common in the Mediterranean region, and wild olive trees were less desirable due to their inferior fruit. The wild olive tree symbolizes the Gentiles' previous state of spiritual barrenness and separation from God's covenant with Israel. This imagery is consistent with <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>, which describes Gentiles as being "separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel."<p><b>and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated</b><br>Grafting is an agricultural practice where a branch from one tree is inserted into another tree so that it can grow and bear fruit. Here, the cultivated olive tree represents Israel, God's chosen people. The act of grafting Gentiles into this tree "contrary to nature" highlights the miraculous and gracious nature of their inclusion into God's covenant community. This reflects the theme of God's grace and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<p><b>how much more readily will these, the natural branches,</b><br>The "natural branches" refer to the Jewish people, who are the original recipients of God's promises and covenants. Historically, Israel is the nation through which God revealed His law and prophets. The natural branches have a heritage and history with God, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>, where Israel is described as a chosen people.<p><b>be grafted into their own olive tree!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the hope and possibility of Israel's restoration. The natural branches being grafted back into their own olive tree signifies the potential for Jewish people to return to faith in Christ and be restored to their covenant relationship with God. This aligns with the prophetic vision of Israel's future redemption found in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-28</a>, where God promises to gather His people and restore them.

St. Paul announces it as a "mystery," which his readers may be ignorant of, but which he wishes them to know. By the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as used by St. Paul, is meant something hidden from man in the Divine counsels till made known by revelation (see <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7, 10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; and, in this Epistle, <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> - a passage which expresses clearly the apostle's meaning in his use of the word). In the LXX. it denotes any Divine secret, which may or may not be made known to man (cf. <a href="/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18, 19</a>, etc.; <a href="/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>; Wisd. 2:22; Ecclus. 22:22 Ecclus. 27:16). So also in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>) it is said to be given to the disciples to know the <span class="accented">mysteries</span> of the kingdom of heaven, but to others in parables. In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> were Divine secrets (as in the Eleusinian Mysteries) which were revealed to the initiated alone. St. Paul uses the word with the same essential meaning; only he speaks of <span class="accented">mysteries</span> which had already been revealed to himself and others by the Spirit, and has ever in view the Divine purposes, previously unknown, for the salvation of mankind. Thus in <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; and Ephesians 3:3, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, he speaks of the Divine purpose to "gather in one all things in Christ," and that "the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs," etc., as a <span class="accented">mystery</span>, "not made known in other ages unto the sons of men," but now revealed to the "holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." (The other passages in which St. Paul uses the word are <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>.) Here he announces the Divine purpose to save "all Israel" at last through the calling of the Gentiles as a <span class="accented">mystery</span> which has been revealed to himself and others, and which he desires the Gentile Christians to be aware of, lest they should be "wise in their own conceits," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presume on their present position of privilege through ignorance of what is in store for Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
