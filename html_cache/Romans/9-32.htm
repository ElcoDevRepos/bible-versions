It prompts reflection on the reason for Israel's failure to attain righteousness. The question sets the stage for the explanation that follows, emphasizing the importance of understanding the root cause of their spiritual misstep.<p><b>Because their pursuit was not by faith,</b><br>Paul highlights the central issue: the lack of faith. In the broader context of Romans, faith is the means by which righteousness is attained (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>). The Jewish people, in this context, were attempting to achieve righteousness through adherence to the law rather than through faith in God. This reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of the law, which was to lead them to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p><b>but as if it were by works.</b><br>This phrase underscores the mistaken approach of seeking righteousness through human effort and adherence to the law. The works-based approach contrasts with the faith-based righteousness that Paul advocates. This reflects a broader biblical theme where human efforts are insufficient for salvation (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The reliance on works is a common pitfall that Paul addresses in several of his letters, emphasizing that salvation is a gift from God.<p><b>They stumbled over the stumbling stone,</b><br>The "stumbling stone" is a metaphor for Jesus Christ, who is both a cornerstone and a stumbling block (<a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14, 28</a>:16; <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-8</a>). The Jewish people, expecting a different kind of Messiah, failed to recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of prophecy. This stumbling is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and highlights the paradox of Christ's role: He is the foundation for those who believe and a stumbling block for those who do not. This imagery is rich in biblical symbolism, illustrating the division between those who accept Christ and those who reject Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the church in Rome, explaining the righteousness that comes from faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, which Paul discusses in terms of their pursuit of righteousness and their stumbling over Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stumbling_stone.htm">The Stumbling Stone</a></b><br>A metaphor for Jesus Christ, whom Israel failed to recognize as the Messiah due to their reliance on the law and works.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_vs._works.htm">Faith vs. Works</a></b><br>The pursuit of righteousness must be grounded in faith, not in human efforts or adherence to the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_christ.htm">Recognizing Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is the cornerstone of our faith.

Here, as throughout the Epistle, the apostle's position is supported by an Old Testament reference. In this instance it is to two passages of Isaiah intermingled (Isaiah 28:16 and Isaiah 8:14). The way in which they are fused is illustrative of St. Paul's way, elsewhere apparent, of referring to Scripture. As a rule, he quotes the LXX., but often varies from it, and sometimes so as to be closer to the Hebrew. Sometimes he seems to be quoting from memory, as one who is familiar with the general drift of prophecy on the subject in hand, and satisfied if the form of his quotation expresses such general drift. In the ease before us, he follows the Hebrew in <a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>:14, and the LXX. 2:28:16, where for the Hebrew expression rendered "shall not make haste," the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, apparently with the same essential meaning; for "make haste" seems to signify "haste away in terror and confusion." The two texts combined express the idea of a stone being laid by the Lord in Zion, which should be the support of the faithful, but a stumbling-block to others. It is not necessary to inquire whether the texts themselves have in the original any obvious Messianic reference. Enough that they denote God's plan of dealing with his people. But to understand the full idea in the apostle's mind, when he speaks of "the stone of stumbling," we must take into account also <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, and our Lord's language, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42, 44</a> and <a href="/luke/20-17.htm">Luke 20:17, 18</a>. In the Psalms we find the figure of "the stone" used thus: "The stone which the builders refused is become the head <span class="accented">stone</span> of the corner;" and in the Gospels our Lord refers to this text as de. noting himself, and subjoins, with reference to Isaiah, the idea of the same stone being one on which some should fall and be broken, with the additional conception of its crushing those on whom itself should fall. The same view essentially is expressed in Simeon's words (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>), that "this Child" should be for the fall as well as for the rising again of many in Israel; and it is repeated definitely in <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> (cf. also <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Why [not]?</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Because [their pursuit was]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
