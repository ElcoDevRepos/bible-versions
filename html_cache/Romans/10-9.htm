The phrase "Jesus is Lord" is a profound statement of faith, acknowledging Jesus' divinity and authority. In the Roman context, declaring Jesus as Lord was countercultural, as it challenged the imperial cult that revered Caesar as lord. This confession aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>, where every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. The act of confessing is not merely verbal but reflects a deep-seated belief and allegiance to Christ.<p><b>and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead,</b><br>Belief in the resurrection is central to Christian faith, as it validates Jesus' victory over sin and death. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the core of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. This belief is not superficial but a profound trust in the historical and spiritual reality of the resurrection. The resurrection is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, and is foundational to the gospel message as outlined in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>. The resurrection assures believers of their future resurrection and eternal life.<p><b>you will be saved.</b><br>Salvation here encompasses deliverance from sin, reconciliation with God, and the promise of eternal life. It is both a present reality and a future hope. The assurance of salvation is based on faith in Christ's finished work, not human effort, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. This promise of salvation is inclusive, available to all who believe, as emphasized in <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
