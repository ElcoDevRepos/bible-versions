It connects to the preceding verses, which discuss the acceptance of differing convictions among believers. The context emphasizes unity and the understanding that Christ's actions have a profound purpose for all believers.<p><b>Christ died</b><br>The death of Christ is central to Christian theology, signifying the atonement for sin. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. Christ's death is the ultimate sacrifice, replacing the need for continual animal sacrifices as outlined in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>and returned to life</b><br>The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Christ's victory over death and sin. It fulfills prophecies like <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and is a testament to His divine nature. The resurrection is also a promise of eternal life for believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>.<p><b>that He might be the Lord</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Christ's authority and sovereignty.
