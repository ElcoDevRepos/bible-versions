This rejection led to the crucifixion, which opened the way for salvation to be offered to all nations. The "riches for the world" signifies the spread of the Gospel beyond the Jewish people to the Gentiles, fulfilling the Abrahamic promise that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This event is pivotal in the history of salvation, as it marks the transition from the Old Covenant, centered on Israel, to the New Covenant, which includes all peoples.<p><b>and their failure means riches for the Gentiles</b><br>The "failure" of Israel to recognize Jesus as the Messiah resulted in the Gospel being preached to the Gentiles. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The "riches for the Gentiles" refers to the spiritual blessings and the inheritance of eternal life now available to them. This was a radical shift in the early church, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles, where the inclusion of Gentiles was a significant theological and cultural development (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><b>how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</b><br>The "fullness" of Israel points to a future time when Israel will recognize Jesus as the Messiah, leading to even greater blessings for the world. This is often interpreted as a prophetic reference to the end times when Israel will experience a spiritual revival. The "greater riches" suggest an even more profound impact on the world, possibly indicating a time of unprecedented spiritual awakening and blessing. This concept is echoed in the prophetic writings of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, which speaks of Israel's future repentance and acceptance of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the church in Rome, which consisted of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, whose partial hardening and rejection of the Messiah led to the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's salvation plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who have been grafted into the blessings of God's covenant through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, a diverse community of Jewish and Gentile Christians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_history.htm">Salvation History</a></b><br>The unfolding plan of God to bring salvation to all humanity, including the pivotal role of Israel and the inclusion of the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_riches_of_god's_grace.htm">The Riches of God's Grace</a></b><br>God's grace is abundantly available to all, both Jews and Gentiles.

And, on the other hand, he looks forward to their full and complete restoration, when every Jew shall be a member of the Messianic kingdom, and there shall not be one missing. The full "complement," as it were, of the nation is what is meant by "fulness;" its temporary reduction and degradation is expressed by "diminishing."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
