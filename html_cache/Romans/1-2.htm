This promise is rooted in the Old Testament, where God foreshadowed the coming of a Savior. <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> is often seen as the first messianic prophecy, indicating the defeat of sin through the seed of the woman. The promise of the gospel is not a new development but a fulfillment of God's eternal plan, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant, and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the crucifixion in detail.<p><b>through His prophets</b><br>The prophets played a crucial role in conveying God's messages to His people. Figures such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were instrumental in revealing God's plans and promises. The prophets often spoke of a coming Messiah who would bring salvation and establish God's kingdom. For example, <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> speaks of a child born to us, a son given, who will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God. The prophets' messages were not only for their immediate context but also pointed forward to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ.<p><b>in the Holy Scriptures</b><br>The term "Holy Scriptures" refers to the sacred writings of the Old Testament, which were regarded as divinely inspired and authoritative. These texts were meticulously preserved and revered by the Jewish people. The Scriptures contain numerous prophecies and types that point to Jesus Christ. For instance, the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice. The Scriptures serve as a testament to God's faithfulness and the unfolding of His redemptive plan throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate author of the promise, who communicated His plan of salvation through the prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers of God in the Old Testament who foretold the coming of the Messiah and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_scriptures.htm">Holy Scriptures</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament writings, which contain the prophecies and promises of God regarding salvation and the coming of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithfulness_of_god.htm">The Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>God's promises are reliable and trustworthy.

Notice how Scripture itself frames that news:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures&#8230; He was buried&#8230; He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>)<p>The gospel, then, is not advice about how to live better&#8212; it is God&#8217;s announcement that He has acted in history to save sinners through the death and resurrection of His Son. Everything else in Romans flows from this core message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He promised beforehand</b><p>Paul immediately reminds us that the gospel is no afterthought; God pledged it long before Jesus was born.<p>&#8226; Right after the fall, the LORD said the woman&#8217;s seed &#8220;will crush your head.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>)<p>&#8226; To Abraham He declared, &#8220;All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a> shows this was the gospel in advance.)<p>&#8226; To David He promised a descendant whose &#8220;throne&#8230; [will be] forever.&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>)<p>By stressing &#8220;promised beforehand,&#8221; Paul underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness. The gospel fulfills a plan that spans the ages, proving we can trust every word He gives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through His prophets</b><p>God did not keep His plan hidden; He spoke &#8220;through His prophets.&#8221; Consider a sampling:<p>&#8226; Isaiah painted the suffering Servant: &#8220;He was pierced for our transgressions.&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>)<p>&#8226; Micah pinpointed Messiah&#8217;s birthplace: &#8220;Out of you, Bethlehem&#8230; will come forth for Me One to be ruler.&#8221; (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>)<p>&#8226; David, writing a thousand years before Christ, described crucifixion details: &#8220;They have pierced my hands and feet.&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>)<p>&#8226; Peter later affirmed, &#8220;All the prophets testify about Him.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-43.htm">Acts 10:43</a>)<p>These prophetic voices weave a unified testimony. When Jesus fulfills their words, the truthfulness of Scripture shines and our confidence in the gospel deepens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Holy Scriptures</b><p>Finally, Paul anchors everything &#8220;in the Holy Scriptures.&#8221; He means the inspired, written Word that cannot fail.<p>&#8226; &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed.&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>)<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself &#8220;explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>)<p>&#8226; The prophets &#8220;searched and investigated carefully&#8221; the salvation now revealed. (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>)<p>By pointing to the Scriptures, Paul calls believers to measure every claim, experience, and doctrine against the infallible Word. The gospel is not grounded in human opinion; it rests on the solid rock of God&#8217;s written revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/1-2.htm">Romans 1:2</a> shows the gospel is:<p>&#8226; good news focused on Jesus,<p>&#8226; faithfully promised long ago,<p>&#8226; proclaimed through the prophets,<p>&#8226; preserved in the Holy Scriptures.<p>God&#8217;s age-old plan, foretold and recorded without error, has now come to pass in Christ. Therefore we rejoice, resting in the certainty that the same trustworthy God who spoke beforehand will complete His saving work in us today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Which he had promised.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">which He promised before by His prophets in holy writ.</span> There is a nicety of meaning expressed by the absence of the article before this last phrase. A slight stress is thus thrown upon the epithet "holy." It is not merely "in certain books which go by the name of holy scriptures," but "in certain writings the character of which is holy." They are "holy" as containing the promises referred to in the text, and others like them. It will thus be seen how even this faint shade of meaning works into the general argument. The writings in which the promises are contained, like the promises themselves, their fulfilment, and the consequences which follow from them, all are part of the same exceptional divine scheme.<p>The prophetic writings describe not only salvation, the <span class= "ital">substance</span> of the gospel, but also the <span class= "ital">preaching</span> of salvation, the gospel itself. (See <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm" title="Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.">Isaiah 40:2</a>, "Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem," and following verses; <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm" title="He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.">Isaiah 42:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm" title="Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.

Here the parenthetical passage begins, extending to the end of ver. 6. It is unnecessary to complicate it by connecting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> with the previous <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It goes more naturally with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, denoting the subject of the Old Testament promises. By <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are meant not only the sacred writers distinctively so called, but (as in <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) all who spoke of old under Divine inspiration, as by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is signified the Old Testament generally. This intimation of the gospel being the fulfilment of prophecy is fitly introduced here, as preparing the reader for the argument of the Epistle, in the course of which the doctrine propounded is shown to be in accordance with the Old Testament, and in fact anticipated therein. This is, indeed, a prominent point in the general teaching of apostles and evangelists. They announce the gospel as the fulfilment of prophecy, and the true completion of all the ancient dispensation; and it is to the Old Testament that, in addressing Israelites, they ever in the first place appeal. Thus St. Peter (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>; <a href="/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>; <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>); thus Stephen (<a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.); thus St. Paul at Antioch in Pisidia, at Thessalonica, and before Agrippa (<a href="/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; <a href="/acts/26-6.htm">Acts 26:6, 22</a>); thus Philip to the Ethiopian proselyte (<a href="/acts/8-35.htm">Acts 8:35</a>); thus Apollos at Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>). Our Lord himself had done the same, as in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>; <a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 44</a>; <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>. All this is important as showing how the old and new dispensations are regarded together as parts of a whole, the old one being but the needful preparation for a fulfilment in the new, and so becoming intelligible; and thus how "through all the ages one eternal purpose runs." There was also a providential preparation in the Gentile world, though not so direct and obvious, and though, of course, not similarly noticed in addresses to disciples of the Law. But St. Paul intimates it; as in his speech on Areopagus, and also, as will be seen, in this Epistle. Even the gospel (it may be further observed) is set forth as but a further stage of progress towards a final consummation, as the dawn only of a coming daybreak. We have still but an earnest of our inheritance; the "earnest expectation of the creature" still awaits "the manifestation of the sons of God." Meanwhile, in the revelation already made through Christ, and the redemption accomplished by him, we are taught to cling to our faith in a Divine purpose throughout the world's perplexing history - that of resolving at last all discords into eternal harmony, and making manifest "one great love, embracing all." This grand view of a providential order leading to a final consummation (though how and when we know not) pervades St. Paul's writings, and should be kept in mind for a proper understanding of this Epistle. God's promises through his prophets in Holy Scripture are said to have been "concerning his Son;" and a question hence arises as to the exact sense in which "his Son" is to be here understood; a consideration of which question may help our interpretation of the expression in the following verse, which is not without difficulty, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. We may distinguish between three senses in which Christ is called "the Son of God." <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> With reference to his Divine pre-existence, the term expressing his relation to the Father from eternity, like the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (and probably the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) of St. John. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> With reference to his incarnation, as being conceived by the Holy Ghost; as in <a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> With reference to the position assigned to the Messiah in psalm and prophecy, as the <span class="accented">Son</span> exalted to the right hand of God, and crowned with glory. It is with the last of these three references that the title is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews; where the ideal of sonship, found in the Old Testament, and imperfectly typified by the theoretic position of the theocratic kings, is regarded as prophetic, and pointing to Christ, in whom alone it is shown to be fulfilled. Hence in that Epistle his exaltation to the rank and dignity of <span class="accented">Son</span> is regarded as subsequent to his human obedience, and even the consequence and reward of it. It was "<span class="accented">because</span> <span class="accented">of</span> the suffering of death (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)" that he has been "crowned with glory and honour" (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>); it was after he had made a purification of sins that he "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high," having "inherited" that "more excellent name" - the name of Son (<a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). It is by no means implied that the said Epistle does not recognize a true Sonship of Christ <span class="accented">before</span> his exaltation; he was all along "the Son" (cf. <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, etc.), though not enthroned as such over mankind and all creation till after his resurrection; and, further, the essential doctrine of his pre-existent and eternal Sonship. in the first of the senses noted above, is distinctly taught (as in ch. 1:3), though not there by the use of the term "Son." All we say is that this word is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews to denote Christ's position and office as the royal High Priest of humanity, exalted, after suffering, to the right hand of God, rather than his original Divine Personality; such being the significance of the title in the prophetic anticipations of the Messiah. Now, this being so, and it being the promises made "through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures concerning his Son" that are being spoken of in the passage before us, it may seem at first most probable that the idea here implied by the word "Son" is the same as in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and no more. We ought, however, to take further into account what St. Paul himself seems to signify by the term when he uses it elsewhere. It does not follow that his own conception of its significance was confined to what was apparent in "the prophets." Reading them in the light of the gospel revelation, he may have seen in their language more implied than it distinctly expressed, and himself intended to imply more. The passages in his Epistles, apart from this chapter, where Christ is called God's Son are these:  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He promised beforehand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#960;&#951;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(proep&#275;ngeilato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4279.htm">Strong's 4279: </a> </span><span class="str2">To promise beforehand.
