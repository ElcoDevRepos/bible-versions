In the context of <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a>, Paul is addressing the concept of dying to sin. The "if" here is not expressing doubt but is a rhetorical device to affirm a truth. The death with Christ is symbolic of the believer's baptism, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>, where baptism represents being buried with Christ. This death signifies the end of the believer's old life of sin, paralleling Christ's physical death on the cross. Theologically, this is rooted in the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, where Christ's death paid the penalty for sin, allowing believers to be justified before God.<p><b>we believe that we will also live with Him</b><br>This phrase speaks to the hope and assurance of eternal life. The future tense "will also live" points to the resurrection life that believers are promised. This is not only a future hope but also a present reality, as believers are called to live a new life empowered by the Holy Spirit. Theologically, this connects to the resurrection of Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>, where Christ's resurrection ensures that death no longer has dominion over Him, and by extension, over those who are in Him. This living with Christ is both a present spiritual reality and a future physical reality, as believers anticipate the resurrection of their own bodies. This promise is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a> and <a href="/colossians/3.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>, which affirm the believer's participation in Christ's resurrection life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus)</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus Christ is the Son of God, whose death and resurrection are foundational to Christian belief.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in Rome.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death_and_resurrection.htm">Death and Resurrection</a></b><br>The events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection are pivotal, symbolizing the believer's spiritual death to sin and new life in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, baptism is a significant event symbolizing the believer's identification with Christ's death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/union_with_christ.htm">Union with Christ</a></b><br>Believers are united with Christ in His death and resurrection.
