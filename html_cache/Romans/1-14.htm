This obligation is not self-imposed but divinely mandated, reflecting his calling as an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). The term "obligated" suggests a debt that must be repaid, indicating Paul's commitment to share the gospel with all people.<p><b>both to Greeks and non-Greeks</b><br>The phrase highlights the universal scope of Paul's mission. "Greeks" refers to those who were part of the Hellenistic culture, which was dominant in the Roman Empire. "Non-Greeks" (or "barbarians" in some translations) refers to those outside this cultural sphere. This distinction underscores the inclusivity of the gospel, breaking down cultural and ethnic barriers (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>both to the wise and the foolish</b><br>Paul's message is for all intellectual and social classes. "The wise" could refer to the educated and philosophically inclined, while "the foolish" might denote those without formal education or societal status. This reflects the biblical principle that God's wisdom often confounds human wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>).

The gospel was at first most readily received by the poor and unlearned, but it did not therefore follow that culture and education were by any means excluded. St. Paul himself was a conspicuous instance to the contrary.
