Paul is reflecting on his own experience with the law. In the broader context of Romans, Paul often uses personal experiences to illustrate theological truths. This discovery is not just intellectual but experiential, highlighting the internal struggle with sin.<p><b>that the very commandment</b><br>The commandment refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to guide the Israelites in living a life pleasing to God. The law is holy and righteous, as Paul affirms elsewhere, but it also serves to reveal sin. The commandment is not inherently flawed; rather, it is the human response to it that is problematic.<p><b>that was meant to bring life</b><br>The law was intended to lead to life by guiding people in righteousness. In <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>, it is stated, "Keep my decrees and laws, for the person who obeys them will live by them." The law was a covenantal gift to Israel, meant to set them apart and lead them to a life of blessing and relationship with God.<p><b>actually brought death</b><br>This paradox highlights the law's role in revealing sin and its consequences. Instead of bringing life, the law exposes human inability to fully comply, thus leading to spiritual death. Paul elaborates on this in <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, where he explains that the law was added so that trespass might increase, but where sin increased, grace increased all the more. The law, therefore, serves to show the need for a savior, pointing to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers life through grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, explaining the relationship between the Law and sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to Israel, which was intended to guide the people in righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The transgression of God's law, which Paul discusses as being revealed and exacerbated by the Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Spiritual death, which is the separation from God, resulting from sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_law.htm">The Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>The Law was given to guide us toward righteousness, but it also reveals our sinful nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradox_of_the_law.htm">The Paradox of the Law</a></b><br>While the Law is holy and good, it inadvertently becomes a tool that sin uses to bring about spiritual death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_a_savior.htm">The Need for a Savior</a></b><br>Recognizing the Law's inability to save us points us to our need for Jesus Christ, who fulfills the Law and offers life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_death.htm">Understanding Spiritual Death</a></b><br>Spiritual death is a separation from God, which the Law highlights by exposing sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_the_spirit.htm">Living in the Spirit</a></b><br>Believers are called to live by the Spirit, which brings life and peace, contrasting the death brought by the Law.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_7_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 7:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_10_Law_s_unintended_death.htm">How does Romans 7:10 illustrate the law's unintended consequence of bringing death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_10_Sin_s_impact_via_the_law.htm">What does Romans 7:10 reveal about the nature of sin and the law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_10_vs_God_s_command_purpose.htm">How can we reconcile Romans 7:10 with the purpose of God's commandments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_10_and_grace_in_6_14_link.htm">How does Romans 7:10 connect to the concept of grace in Romans 6:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Romans_7_10_boost_faith_in_Christ.htm">How can understanding Romans 7:10 help us rely more on Christ's righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_10_Law_s_link_to_death.htm">How does Romans 7:10 relate to the concept of the law bringing death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Paul_say_law_leads_to_death.htm">Why does Paul describe the commandment as leading to death in Romans 7:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_10_Sin_law_s_theological_role.htm">What is the theological significance of Romans 7:10 in understanding sin and the law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_essence_of_manhood.htm">What defines the essence of being a man?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_bible_question_answers.htm">What are the answers to Bible questions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_2_kings_10_1-11_justify_killing.htm">How does 2 Kings 10:1-11 reconcile mass slaughter with the broader biblical prohibition against murder?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_true_christian.htm">What defines a true Christian?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Romans 7:10 Mean</div><b>So I discovered</b><p>Paul speaks from lived experience.
