The Apostle Paul is extending the example of Abraham's faith to all believers, not just to the Jewish people. This reflects the universal nature of the gospel, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that there is neither Jew nor Greek in Christ. The promise of righteousness through faith is available to all who believe, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries.<p><b>to whom righteousness will be credited</b><br>The concept of righteousness being credited is central to Paul's argument about justification by faith. This is a legal term, implying that righteousness is accounted or imputed to believers, not based on their works but through faith. This mirrors <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness. It underscores the doctrine of imputed righteousness, where believers are seen as righteous before God because of their faith in Christ, not because of their own merit.<p><b>for us who believe in Him</b><br>Faith is the key component here, specifically faith in God. This belief is not a general faith but a specific trust in the God who fulfills His promises. The focus on belief aligns with <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. This faith is active and personal, requiring a response to the revelation of God in Christ.<p><b>who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith, as it validates Jesus' divinity and the efficacy of His atoning work. The phrase highlights God's power and faithfulness, as He raised Jesus, confirming the truth of Jesus' claims and the hope of eternal life for believers. This connects to <a href="/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>, where Paul argues that if Christ has not been raised, faith is futile. The resurrection is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection assures believers of their future resurrection and eternal life with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome to explain the doctrine of justification by faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Although not mentioned directly in this verse, Abraham is the central figure in <a href="/bsb/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>, used as an example of faith credited as righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "our Lord," Jesus is the one whom God raised from the dead, and belief in Him is the basis for righteousness being credited to believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who raised Jesus from the dead, demonstrating His power and the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who are being taught about the righteousness that comes through faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_righteousness.htm">Faith and Righteousness</a></b><br>Just as Abraham's faith was credited as righteousness, so too is our faith in Jesus credited to us.
