Abraham's role as "father" emphasizes his foundational position in the faith and covenantal history of Israel.<p><b>who not only are circumcised</b><br>This highlights that mere physical circumcision is not sufficient for righteousness. The Jewish people, while marked by this sign, are called to a deeper spiritual reality.
