The mystery of the Gospel, once hidden, is now disclosed through Jesus Christ. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>, where Paul speaks of the mystery made known by the Spirit. The revelation signifies the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, previously concealed but now manifest in the New Testament era.<p><b>and made known through the writings of the prophets</b><br>The writings of the prophets refer to the Old Testament Scriptures, which foretold the coming of the Messiah and the salvation He would bring. <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> are examples of prophetic writings that pointed to Christ. This phrase underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, affirming that the Gospel was always part of God's plan, as seen in <a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, where Jesus explains the Scriptures concerning Himself.<p><b>by the command of the eternal God</b><br>This highlights God's sovereign authority and eternal nature. The command signifies divine initiative and purpose, emphasizing that the revelation of the Gospel is not a human invention but a divine mandate. This aligns with God's unchanging nature, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, and His eternal purpose, as described in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.<p><b>in order to lead all nations</b><br>The phrase reflects the universal scope of the Gospel. God's plan of salvation extends beyond Israel to include all ethnicities and peoples, fulfilling the promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> that all nations would be blessed through him. This global mission is echoed in the Great Commission of <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>to the obedience that comes from faith&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that true obedience to God stems from faith, not merely adherence to the law. It reflects the transformative power of faith in Christ, leading to a life of obedience. This concept is central to Paul's theology, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>, where he speaks of bringing about the obedience of faith among the Gentiles. It underscores the idea that faith and works are interconnected, with genuine faith producing a life of obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, who is writing to the believers in Rome to explain the gospel and its implications for both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets whose writings foretold the coming of the Messiah and the revelation of God's plan for salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eternal_god.htm">The Eternal God</a></b><br>The sovereign and timeless God who commands and orchestrates the revelation of His plan for humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations (Gentiles)</a></b><br>Represents all people groups outside of Israel, highlighting the universal scope of the gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_of_faith.htm">Obedience of Faith</a></b><br>The intended response to the gospel, which involves both belief in Christ and a life that reflects that faith through obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The gospel is for all people, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.
