God is the one who offers Jesus Christ as a solution to humanity's sin problem. This aligns with the overarching biblical narrative of God taking the first step in the redemption process, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God gives His only Son. The presentation of Christ is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of a suffering servant provided by God.<p><b>as an atoning sacrifice</b><br>The term "atoning sacrifice" refers to the concept of propitiation, which involves appeasing the wrath of God due to sin. This is rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, particularly the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), where the high priest would offer sacrifices to atone for the sins of the people. Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of these sacrifices, as He is the perfect and final offering for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>in His blood</b><br>The mention of "His blood" underscores the necessity of a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, as established in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, which states that life is in the blood and it is given on the altar to make atonement. The shedding of Jesus' blood is central to the New Covenant, as highlighted in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>, where Jesus speaks of His blood being poured out for the forgiveness of sins.<p><b>through faith</b><br>Faith is the means by which individuals receive the benefits of Christ's atoning sacrifice. This emphasizes the personal response required to access salvation, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which states that salvation is by grace through faith. Faith is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Christ's finished work.<p><b>in order to demonstrate His righteousness</b><br>God's righteousness is demonstrated in the act of providing Jesus as a sacrifice. This shows that God is just and upholds His moral law while also being the justifier of those who have faith in Jesus (<a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>). It highlights the balance between God's justice and mercy, ensuring that sin is punished while providing a way for sinners to be reconciled to Him.<p><b>because in His forbearance</b><br>Forbearance refers to God's patience and restraint in delaying judgment. Throughout history, God has shown patience, allowing time for repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). This patience is evident in the Old Testament, where God often withheld immediate judgment on Israel despite their repeated disobedience.<p><b>He had passed over the sins committed beforehand</b><br>This phrase connects to the concept of God's temporary overlooking of sins before Christ's sacrifice. It reflects the idea that the full penalty for sin was not exacted until Jesus' atoning death. The "passing over" is reminiscent of the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where the blood of the lamb spared the Israelites from judgment, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who orchestrates the plan of salvation and demonstrates His righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, presented as the atoning sacrifice for humanity's sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/atoning_sacrifice.htm">Atoning Sacrifice</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus' sacrificial death, which satisfies the requirements of God's justice and allows for the forgiveness of sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/faith.htm">Faith</a></b><br>The means by which believers receive the benefits of Christ's atoning sacrifice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sins_committed_beforehand.htm">Sins Committed Beforehand</a></b><br>Refers to the sins committed by humanity before the coming of Christ, which God, in His forbearance, had passed over.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>Jesus' sacrifice is central to Christian faith, fulfilling the Old Testament sacrificial system and providing a way for reconciliation with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_the_key.htm">Faith as the Key</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of faith in receiving the benefits of Christ's atoning work.

At the cross justice and mercy meet, inviting every believer into confident, eternal peace with a holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25, 26) The death of Christ had a twofold object or final cause:--(1) It was to be, like the sacrifices of the old covenant, an offering propitiatory to God, and actualised in the believer through faith. (2) It was to demonstrate the righteousness of God by showing that sin would entail punishment, though it might not be punished in the person of the sinner. The apparent absence of any adequate retribution for the sins of past ages made it necessary that by one conspicuous instance it should be shown that this was in no sense due to an ignoring of the true nature of sin. The retributive justice of God was all the time unimpaired. The death of Christ served for its vindication, at the same time that a way to escape from its consequences was opened out through the justification of the believer.<p>Precisely in what sense the punishment of our sins fell upon Christ, and in what sense the justice of God was vindicated by its so falling, is another point which we are not able to determine. Nothing, we may be sure, can be involved which is in <span class= "ital">ultimate</span> conflict with morality. At the same time, we see that under the ordinary government of God, the innocent suffer for the guilty, and there may be some sort of transference of this analogy into the transcendental sphere. Both the natural and the supernatural government of God are schemes "imperfectly comprehended." In any case, Christ was innocent, and Christ suffered. On any theory there is a connection between His death and human sin. <span class= "ital">What</span> connection, is a question to which, perhaps, only a partial answer can be given. Some weighty remarks on this subject will be found in Butler's <span class= "ital">Analogy of Religion,</span> Part II., Romans 5 (latter part).<p>(25) <span class= "bld">Hath set forth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">set forth, publicly exhibited,</span> in the single act of the death upon the cross.<p><span class= "bld">A propitiation.</span>--The Greek word properly means "that which renders propitious." Here, "that which renders God propitious." In some way, which is not explained at all in this passage, and imperfectly explained elsewhere, the death of Christ did act so as to render God "propitious" towards men. He became more ready to pardon as they became more anxious to be pardoned.<p>There is a remarkable use of the same Greek word in the LXX. version of the Old Testament to express the <span class= "ital">mercy-seat, i.e.,</span> the lid or covering of the ark which was sprinkled by the high priest with the blood of the victim on the Day of Atonement. Some have thought that there is a reference to this here. Christ is the <span class= "ital">mercy-seat</span> of the New Covenant. It is upon Him, as it were, that the divine grace, drawn forth by His own atoning blood, resides. It would hardly be a conclusive objection to this view that, according to it, Christ would be represented as at once the victim whose blood is sprinkled and the covering of the ark on which it is sprinkled; for a similar double reference certainly occurs in <a href="/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>, where Christ is typified at one and the same time both by the victim whose blood is shed and by the high priest by whom it is offered. There seem to be, however, on the whole, reasons for supplying rather the idea of "sacrifice," which is more entirely in keeping with the context, and is especially supported by the two phrases, "whom God hath set forth (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> exhibited <span class= "ital">publicly,</span> whereas the ark was confined to the secrecy of the Holy of Holies), and "in His blood." We should translate, therefore, <span class= "ital">a propitiatory</span> or <span class= "ital">expiatory </span>(<span class= "ital">sacrifice</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Through faith.</span>--Faith is the <span class= "ital">causa apprehendens</span> by which the proffered pardon takes effect upon the soul of the believer.<p><span class= "bld">In his blood.</span>--On the whole, it seems best not to join these words with "through faith," but to refer them to the main word of the sentence. "Whom God set forth by the shedding of His blood to be a propitiatory offering through faith." It was in the shedding of the blood that the essence of the atonement exhibited upon the cross consisted. No doubt other portions of the life of Christ led up to this one; but this was the culminating act in it, viewed as an atonement.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">presented</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(proetheto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4388.htm">Strong's 4388: </a> </span><span class="str2">To purpose, design beforehand, determine.
