The concept of wages is used here to illustrate a principle of justice and fairness. Biblically, this idea is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, which emphasizes the importance of paying workers their due wages. Theologically, this sets up a contrast between human effort and divine grace.<p><b>are not credited as a gift</b><br>The term "credited" is an accounting term, suggesting a transaction or reckoning. In the cultural context of Paul's time, a gift (Greek: "charis") was something given freely, without expectation of repayment. This phrase highlights the distinction between earning something through work and receiving something freely. This is a key theme in Paul's letters, particularly in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God, not a result of works.<p><b>but as an obligation</b><br>The word "obligation" implies a debt or duty that must be fulfilled. In the Roman legal system, obligations were binding and enforceable. This phrase underscores the idea that if salvation were based on works, it would be something owed, not freely given. This contrasts with the biblical teaching of grace, where God&#8217;s favor is unmerited. Theologically, this points to the futility of trying to earn God's favor through human effort, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>, which states that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological writings.

This highlights the distinction between earning wages through works and receiving righteousness as a gift through faith. Justification is not something we earn; it is a gift from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_grace.htm">The Nature of Grace</a></b><br>The Greek word for "gift" (charis) underscores the unmerited favor of God.

It therefore carries with it no ground of boasting.<p>The proposition is put in a general form. Those who base their claim on works have a right to their reward. It is not conceded to them by any sort of imputation, but is their <span class= "ital">desert.</span> On the other hand (<a href="/romans/4-5.htm" title="But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.">Romans 4:5</a>), those who rely only upon faith, even though ungodly themselves, have righteousness imputed to them. This latter was Abraham's case, and not the former. (The specific application to Abraham is not expressed, but implied.)<p><span class= "bld">The reward.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">his wages.</span> The relation between what he receives and what he does is that of wages for work done. He can claim it, if need be, in a court of law.

The expression, "him that worketh" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), evidently means him that works with a view to a reward which he can claim; or, as Luther explains it, "one who deals in works;" or, as we might say with the same signification, "the worker." (For a like use of the present participle, cf. <a href="/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>.)

Thus there is here no denial of the necessity of good works. <span class="accented">It is the principle only of justification</span> that is in view. "Neque enim fideles vult esse ignavos; sed tantum mercenarias esse vetat, qui a Deo quicquam reposcant quasi jure debitum" (Calvin). One view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>, being meant as an illustration, thus: The workman's wage is due to him, and not granted as a favour (so Afford).
