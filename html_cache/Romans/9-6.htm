The context is Paul's discussion of the Jewish people's rejection of Christ and the implications for God's promises. Historically, God's word to Israel included covenants and promises, such as those made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The assertion that God's word has not failed emphasizes the faithfulness of God despite apparent contradictions. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which assures that God's word will accomplish its purpose. Theologically, it underscores the belief that God's promises are fulfilled in ways that may not align with human expectations.<p><b>For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of a distinction between physical and spiritual Israel. Paul is addressing the idea that mere physical descent from Abraham does not guarantee inclusion in the true people of God. This distinction is rooted in the Old Testament, where God often emphasized faith and obedience over mere lineage (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). Theologically, this points to the idea of a remnant, a theme found in the prophets, such as <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, where only a remnant of Israel will return. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>, where those who have faith are considered children of Abraham. This concept is crucial for understanding the nature of the church as the true Israel, a spiritual community defined by faith in Christ rather than ethnic heritage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the Book of Romans, addressing the church in Rome and explaining the righteousness of God and the role of Israel in God's plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to both the physical descendants of Jacob (Israel) and the spiritual Israel, which includes those who are part of God's covenant through faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_word.htm">God's Word</a></b><br>The promises and covenants made by God, particularly those concerning Israel and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_israel.htm">Understanding True Israel</a></b><br>Not all physical descendants of Israel are part of the spiritual Israel.

The promise of God was indeed given to Israel, but that did not mean roundly all who could claim descent from Jacob without further limitation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - (2) (<span class="accented">a</span>) After this avowal of his deep sorrow, and his reasons for feeling it, the apostle now proceeds to deal with the subject. First (as has been said above) he shows (vers. 6-13) that the present exclusion of the great majority of the Jews from Christian privileges does not imply any <span class="accented">unfaithfulness</span> on God's part to his ancient promises; and thus it follows that the fact of their exclusion is no proof of the gospel not being the true fulfilment of those promises. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it is not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect</span> (or, <span class="accented">hath come to naught</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For they are not all Israel who are of Israel: neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called</span>. The promises to the patriarchs never, from the first, implied the inheritance of them by all the physical descendants of those patriarchs; even in Israel there is a recognized distinction between being of the race of Israel and being the true Israel of God; in the original promise to Abraham the descendants of Ishmael (though equally with those of Isaac, his physical seed) were excluded. And so even the race of Israel is but a part of the whole seed of Abraham, to whom the promise was made. Hence it follows that the present exclusion of the majority of even the race of Israel from the inheritance of the promises is not inconsistent with the original purport of those promises. The quotation from <a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>, "In Isaac," etc., is properly (as in the original Hebrew) "In Isaac shall a seed be named to thee;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "In Isaac it shall come to pass that posterity of thine shall have the name and position of <span class="accented">the seed of Abraham</span>, and be recognized as the inheritors of the promise" (Meyer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[It is] not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#967;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouch)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
