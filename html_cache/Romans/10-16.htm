In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing the Jewish rejection of the gospel. Historically, the Jewish people were God's chosen nation, entrusted with the Law and the Prophets. However, many did not accept Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant being rejected. This rejection is not unique to the Jews; it reflects a broader human tendency to resist divine truth, as seen throughout biblical history.<p><b>For Isaiah says,</b><br>Paul references the Old Testament to validate his point, showing continuity between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament message. Isaiah, a major prophet, spoke to Israel during a time of spiritual decline, calling them back to faithfulness. By citing Isaiah, Paul underscores the prophetic nature of Israel's unbelief and the consistency of God's message across time.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, who has believed our message?&#8221;</b><br>This quote is from <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, a chapter that vividly describes the suffering and rejection of the Messiah. The rhetorical question emphasizes the widespread disbelief and lack of acceptance of God's revelation. In the New Testament, this disbelief is seen in the rejection of Jesus by many of His contemporaries. The phrase also points to the fulfillment of prophecy in Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's message. The question reflects a lament over the hardness of human hearts, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-38</a>, where despite Jesus' miracles, many still did not believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman church, explaining the righteousness that comes from faith and the importance of spreading the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>An Old Testament prophet whose writings are frequently quoted in the New Testament.

Just as Isaiah had said.<p>The argument does not run quite smoothly. The Apostle has two thoughts in his mind: (1) the necessity that the gospel should be preached before it could be believed; (2) the fact that, although it was preached (and accepted by many among the Gentiles), it was not accepted by the Jews.

The "sound" and the "words" in the psalm are those of the heavens and the firmament. But in the second part of the psalm, beginning at ver. 7, the psalmist passes from God's revelation of himself in nature to his revelation of himself in his Word. Still the psalm itself cannot well be understood as intimating the universal proclamation of the gospel. Nor is it necessary to suppose that St. Paul so understood it. Enough for him that the words he quotes express admirably what he desires to say. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/10-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(All&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
