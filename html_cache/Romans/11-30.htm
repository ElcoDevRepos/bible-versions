Historically, Gentiles were not part of God's chosen people and were often seen as living in idolatry and immorality. This disobedience is a common theme in the New Testament, where Gentiles are described as being "without hope and without God in the world" (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>). The transformation from disobedience to obedience is a key aspect of the Christian message, highlighting the power of the Gospel to change lives.<p><b>have now received mercy</b><br>The concept of mercy is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing God's compassion and forgiveness. In the context of Romans, mercy is extended to the Gentiles as part of God's redemptive plan. This mercy is not earned but is a gift from God, reflecting His grace and love. Theologically, this aligns with the idea that salvation is available to all, regardless of their past, through faith in Jesus Christ. This mercy is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>, where God promises to show mercy to those who were not His people.<p><b>through their disobedience</b><br>This refers to the disobedience of Israel, God's chosen people, who rejected Jesus as the Messiah. This rejection led to the opening of the Gospel to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>, where Paul and Barnabas declare that they are turning to the Gentiles after being rejected by the Jews. This shift is part of God's sovereign plan, using Israel's disobedience to bring salvation to the Gentiles. It also serves as a reminder of the mystery of God's ways, where He can use human disobedience to fulfill His divine purposes, as seen throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, both Jews and Gentiles, explaining the mystery of God's plan for Israel and the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who have received the gospel and mercy from God, despite their previous disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, whose disobedience has led to the extension of mercy to the Gentiles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign being who orchestrates the plan of salvation, extending mercy to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disobedience.htm">Disobedience</a></b><br>The state of rebellion against God, which both Jews and Gentiles have experienced, leading to the opportunity for mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_mercy.htm">Understanding Mercy</a></b><br>Recognize that mercy is not earned but given by God, even when we are in a state of disobedience.
