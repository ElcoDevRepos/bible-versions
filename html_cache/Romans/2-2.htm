It reflects the apostle Paul's confidence in the knowledge of God's character and His righteous standards. This assurance is rooted in the teachings of the Old Testament and the revelation of God's nature throughout Scripture.<p><b>that God&#8217;s judgment</b><br>God's judgment refers to His divine assessment and decision-making regarding human actions. In the biblical context, judgment is a central theme, highlighting God's role as the ultimate judge of all creation. This judgment is consistent with His holiness and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.<p><b>against those who do such things</b><br>"Such things" refers to the sinful behaviors listed in the preceding chapter, <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>, which includes idolatry, immorality, and various forms of wickedness.

The Jews, it seems, had an idea that the Gentiles only would be judged, while they would be able to claim admission into the Messianic kingdom as theirs by right of birth.<p><span class= "bld">According to truth.</span>--The principle on which God's judgment will proceed will be that of truth or reality, as opposed to appearance, worldly status, formal precedence, &c.
