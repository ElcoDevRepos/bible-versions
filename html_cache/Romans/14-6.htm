This phrase emphasizes that the motivation behind observing these days should be to honor the Lord. The context of <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a> addresses disputes between Jewish and Gentile believers, where Jewish Christians might continue to observe traditional holy days. The key point is the intention behind the observance, aligning with <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>, which speaks of such practices as a shadow of things to come, with the substance belonging to Christ. The focus is on personal conviction and honoring God, rather than legalistic adherence.<p><b>he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God;</b><br>This phrase addresses the issue of dietary practices, which was a significant point of contention in the early church. Some believers, particularly Gentiles, felt free to eat all foods, while others, often Jewish Christians, adhered to dietary laws. The act of eating is sanctified by giving thanks to God, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4-5</a>, which states that everything created by God is good and should be received with thanksgiving. The emphasis is on gratitude and the recognition of God's provision, rather than the specific food consumed.<p><b>and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</b><br>Abstaining from certain foods or practices is also presented as a valid expression of faith, provided it is done with the intention of honoring the Lord. This reflects the principle of Christian liberty, where believers are free to follow their conscience in matters not explicitly commanded or forbidden by Scripture. The act of abstaining, like eating, is validated by the giving of thanks to God, highlighting the importance of a thankful heart. This aligns with the teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, which instructs believers to do everything for the glory of God, whether eating or drinking.

Paul is addressing believers who set aside certain days for worship or fasting. Their motivation matters more than the calendar itself.<p>&#8226; When they dedicate a day, they are intentionally honoring Christ, echoing <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>, &#8220;This is the day the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s goal is unity, not uniformity. <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16&#8211;17</a> warns against judging others over festivals, reminding us that &#8220;the substance belongs to Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse anchors every special observance in personal devotion: the day is the Lord&#8217;s, not a badge of superiority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God</b><p>&#8226; Believers who freely eat any food express their liberty by directing the act God-ward. &#8220;Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Gratitude is the distinguishing mark. Before the first bite, the eater pauses to thank God, aligning with <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, &#8220;For every creation of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s vision in <a href="/acts/10-13.htm">Acts 10:13&#8211;15</a> opened the door to eating formerly restricted foods, yet even that freedom is exercised in conscious reliance on the Lord.<p>&#8226; Liberty without thanksgiving drifts into self-indulgence; liberty with thanksgiving becomes worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God</b><p>&#8226; Some believers refrain from certain foods or practices, not out of fear, but out of reverence. <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a> models this spirit when Daniel &#8220;resolved in his heart&#8221; to abstain for God&#8217;s sake.<p>&#8226; Their abstinence is framed positively: they are offering a sacrifice of self-denial, just as <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> calls us to present our bodies &#8220;as a living sacrifice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Thanksgiving remains central. Even while saying no, they say yes to God&#8217;s provision&#8212;much like <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, &#8220;The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Abstinence devoid of gratitude can harden into legalism; abstinence wrapped in gratitude deepens devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a> teaches that whether a believer marks a special day, enjoys a meal, or abstains from it, the decisive factor is the heart&#8217;s orientation toward the Lord, expressed through genuine thanksgiving. The passage invites every follower of Christ to let gratitude govern their freedoms and their restraints, fostering unity in the body while keeping Jesus at the center of every choice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Regardeth.</span>--Much as we might say, "he who minds the day," or directs his thoughts and feelings to it.<p><span class= "bld">He that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.</span>--This clause is omitted by the best MSS. and editors.<p><span class= "bld">For he giveth God thanks.</span>--By the saying of grace at meat, the meal, whatever it may be, is consecrated to God, and he who partakes of it shows that he does so in no irreverent spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord</span> (omit, as ill-supported, as well as unnecessary, <span class="accented">and he that regardeth not</span>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.); he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks</span>. Both parties are supposed to be equally desirous of serving God. The eater of whatsoever is set before him is so, as is shown by his thanking God for it - observe "for he giveth," etc. - and no creature of God can be polluting "if received with thanksgiving" (<a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>); the abstainer gives thanks too; and so his dinner of herbs is also hallowed to him. (Though it is not necessary to confine the thought to the practice of saying grace before meat, this is doubtless in view as expressing the asserted thankfulness. For proof of the custom, cf. <a href="/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4, 5</a>.)
