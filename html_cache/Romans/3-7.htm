In the broader context of Romans, Paul is discussing the relationship between human sin and divine justice. The idea that human falsehood can serve to accentuate God's truthfulness is a rhetorical argument Paul uses to address potential objections to his teachings. This reflects the Jewish understanding of God's faithfulness despite human unfaithfulness, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). The concept of God's truthfulness is central to His character, as seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> and <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the truth.<p><b>to the increase of His glory</b><br>The increase of God's glory through human actions, even sinful ones, is a complex theological concept. In the biblical narrative, God's glory is often revealed through His interactions with humanity, including judgment and redemption. The idea that God's glory can be increased through human sin is not to suggest that sin is good, but rather that God's ability to bring good from evil is a testament to His sovereignty and power. This is echoed in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph tells his brothers that what they intended for evil, God intended for good.<p><b>why am I still condemned as a sinner?</b><br>Paul anticipates the argument that if sin serves to highlight God's righteousness, it might seem unjust for God to condemn sinners. This rhetorical question underscores the justice of God in holding individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of the outcomes. The condemnation of sin is a consistent theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the need for repentance and the transformative power of grace. <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a> further clarifies that grace is not a license to sin, reinforcing the call to live righteously. The question also points to the necessity of Christ's atonement, as human efforts cannot achieve righteousness on their own, a theme central to the message of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome and discussing the righteousness of God and the sinfulness of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The audience of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile Christians, facing theological and practical challenges in understanding the gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Central to the discussion, as Paul is exploring the nature of God's truthfulness and righteousness in contrast to human sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_righteousness.htm">Understanding God's Righteousness</a></b><br>God's truth and righteousness are not dependent on human actions.
