In biblical context, "flesh" often refers to the sinful nature of humanity, which is in opposition to God's will. The Apostle Paul frequently uses this term to describe the human tendency to sin and live according to worldly desires. This distinction is crucial in understanding the transformation that occurs in a believer's life. The control by the flesh is characterized by actions and thoughts that are self-centered and contrary to God's commands.<p><b>but by the Spirit,</b><br>The "Spirit" here refers to the Holy Spirit, who empowers believers to live in accordance with God's will. This transformation is a key theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing the new life and freedom found in Christ. The Holy Spirit's role is to guide, convict, and enable believers to live righteously. This is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people.<p><b>if the Spirit of God lives in you.</b><br>This conditional statement highlights the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit as a defining characteristic of a true believer. The indwelling Spirit is a mark of God's ownership and a guarantee of eternal life, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>. The presence of the Spirit is not just a theological concept but a transformative reality that affects every aspect of a believer's life, enabling them to bear spiritual fruit as described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.<p><b>And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ,</b><br>This phrase underscores the necessity of the Holy Spirit for belonging to Christ. The "Spirit of Christ" is synonymous with the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the unity between Christ and the Spirit. This connection is vital for understanding the Trinitarian nature of God and the work of the Spirit in applying the redemptive work of Christ to believers. The absence of the Spirit indicates a lack of genuine faith and relationship with Christ.<p><b>he does not belong to Christ.</b><br>Belonging to Christ is a central theme in the New Testament, signifying a personal relationship with Jesus and inclusion in the body of believers. This phrase serves as a warning and a call to self-examination, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>. It stresses the importance of the Spirit's presence as evidence of salvation and union with Christ. This belonging is not just a matter of identity but also of allegiance and obedience to Christ as Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who indwells believers and empowers them to live according to God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Referring to Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity, whose life, death, and resurrection are the foundation of the faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flesh.htm">The Flesh</a></b><br>A term used by Paul to describe the sinful nature and human inclinations that are opposed to God's Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/indwelling_of_the_spirit.htm">Indwelling of the Spirit</a></b><br>The presence of the Holy Spirit is a defining mark of a true believer.

But</span> (not <span class="accented">now</span>, as in the Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his</span>. That is - Though I imply the possibility of even the baptized being still in the flesh, so as to be unable to please God, this is certainly not <span class="accented">your</span> condition; if, indeed (as is surely the case), your conversion was a reality, so that you have become really Christ's; for the Spirit of Christ (which is the Spirit of God) of necessity <span class="accented">dwells</span> (so as to be the ruling power) in all such as are really his (cf <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). We observe here how "the Spirit of Christ" is identified with "the Spirit of God," so as to imply the essential Deity of Christ, and also to lend support to the doctrine of the double procession of the Holy Ghost (cf. <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>). Observe, too, how persistently and continually the apostle presses his protest against antinomian abuse of the doctrine of grace, with which he began this section of his Epistle, at ch. 6:1, He never loses sight of it; it pervades the whole. If St. Paul, especially in this Epistle, is, on the one hand, the great exponent of the doctrine of justification by faith only, he is, on the other, no less the persistent preacher of the necessity of works. Sanctification is continually pressed as the necessary result, as well as evidence, of justification. He only shuts out human works from the office of justifying. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
