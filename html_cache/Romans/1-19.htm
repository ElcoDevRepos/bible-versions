This aligns with the concept of general revelation, where God's existence and attributes are evident in creation (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>). The idea is that God's nature and power are visible in the world around us, making it possible for everyone to have some understanding of Him.<p><b>is plain to them</b><br>The term "plain" indicates clarity and obviousness. This suggests that the knowledge of God is not hidden or obscure but is evident and understandable. This can be connected to the idea that humans are created in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), which includes the capacity to perceive and understand divine truths. The clarity of God's revelation in nature leaves humanity without excuse for unbelief.<p><b>because God has made it plain to them</b><br>This emphasizes God's active role in revealing Himself to humanity. It is not merely that the evidence of God is available, but that God Himself has ensured that this knowledge is accessible. This reflects God's desire for relationship and communication with His creation. Theologically, this can be linked to the concept of prevenient grace, where God initiates the revelation and relationship with humanity. This also ties into the broader biblical narrative where God continually reveals Himself through prophets, scripture, and ultimately through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome, addressing both Jewish and Gentile Christians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of a diverse group of believers in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who reveals Himself to humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/humanity.htm">Humanity</a></b><br>The general audience to whom God has made His nature evident.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The means through which God has revealed Himself, as implied in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_self-revelation.htm">God's Self-Revelation</a></b><br>God has made His existence and attributes evident to all people through creation.
