In the context of <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, Paul is addressing the partial hardening of Israel, which has led to some Jews being "broken off" from the covenantal blessings. This imagery of branches being broken off is consistent with Old Testament symbolism, where Israel is often depicted as an olive tree (<a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16-17</a>). The breaking off signifies a temporary setting aside due to unbelief, not a permanent rejection.<p><b>and you, a wild olive shoot,</b><br>The "wild olive shoot" represents Gentile believers who have come to faith in Christ. In ancient agriculture, wild olive trees were considered inferior and unproductive compared to cultivated ones. This metaphor highlights the unexpected and gracious inclusion of the Gentiles into the blessings originally given to Israel. It underscores the theme of God's grace extending beyond ethnic Israel to include all nations, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>have been grafted in among the others</b><br>Grafting is an agricultural practice where a branch from one tree is inserted into another tree so that it can grow and produce fruit. This process symbolizes the inclusion of Gentiles into the spiritual blessings and promises given to Israel. Theologically, it emphasizes the unity of Jews and Gentiles in the body of Christ, as both are now part of the same spiritual family (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>). This inclusion is not based on heritage or works but on faith in Jesus Christ.<p><b>to share in the nourishment of the olive root,</b><br>The "olive root" represents the patriarchs and the covenants God made with them, particularly the Abrahamic covenant. The nourishment signifies the spiritual blessings and promises that flow from these covenants, including salvation and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. By being grafted in, Gentile believers partake in these blessings, becoming heirs to the promises of God (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>). This sharing in the nourishment underscores the continuity of God's redemptive plan and the fulfillment of His promises through Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the church in Rome, which consisted of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_olive_tree.htm">The Olive Tree</a></b><br>Symbolizes the people of God, originally representing Israel, but now inclusive of Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_broken_branches.htm">The Broken Branches</a></b><br>Represents the Jews who have rejected the Gospel and thus have been temporarily set aside.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wild_olive_shoot.htm">The Wild Olive Shoot</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Gentiles who have been grafted into the people of God through faith in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_olive_root.htm">The Olive Root</a></b><br>Represents the patriarchs and the promises of God, the spiritual heritage and blessings that come from being part of God's covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_spiritual_heritage.htm">Understanding Our Spiritual Heritage</a></b><br>Recognize that as Gentile believers, we are grafted into the rich spiritual heritage of Israel, sharing in the promises given to the patriarchs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_gratitude.htm">Humility and Gratitude</a></b><br>Approach our inclusion in God's family with humility and gratitude, acknowledging that it is by grace, not by our own merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>Embrace the unity we have in Christ, celebrating the diversity of the body of believers while maintaining the unity of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_in_faith.htm">Fruitfulness in Faith</a></b><br>As branches grafted into the olive tree, we are called to bear fruit, living lives that reflect the character and mission of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/warning_against_arrogance.htm">Warning Against Arrogance</a></b><br>Be cautious of spiritual pride, remembering that our position in God's family is a result of His mercy and not our own doing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_11_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 11:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_17_Gentiles_in_God_s_covenant.htm">How does Romans 11:17 illustrate the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_grafted_in_show_God_s_grace.htm">What does being "grafted in" teach about God's grace and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_arrogance_as_wild_olive_shoots.htm">How can we avoid arrogance as "wild olive shoots" in Romans 11:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_17_Eph_2_11-13_Unity_in_Christ.htm">How does Romans 11:17 connect with Ephesians 2:11-13 on unity in Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_nurture_faith_as_a_root.htm">How can we nurture our faith as part of the "nourishing root"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_grafted_in_in_Romans_11_17.htm">What does Romans 11:17 mean by "grafted in" regarding Gentiles and Jews?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_17_and_spiritual_equality.htm">How does Romans 11:17 challenge the idea of spiritual superiority among believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Key_context_for_Romans_11_17.htm">What historical context is essential to understanding Romans 11:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/romans_11_17-18__grafting_as_spiritual_change.htm">Romans 11:17&#8211;18 &#8211; How can the metaphor of grafting branches represent a real spiritual transformation without conflicting scientific understanding of plant biology?

It is held conditionally on the tenure of faith. He ought, therefore, anxiously to guard against any failure in faith. For the moment God has turned towards him the gracious side of His providence, as towards the Jew He has turned the severe side. But this relation may easily be reversed, and the Jew received back into the favour which he once enjoyed.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">but.</span><p><span class= "bld">Among them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> among the branches of the olive-tree generally, both those which are broken off and those which are suffered to remain. This seems on the whole the more probable view; it would be possible to translate the words, <span class= "ital">in place of them</span> (the branches broken off).<p><span class= "bld">Partakest of the root and fatness</span>.--The meaning of this is sufficiently obvious as it stands. If, as perhaps is probable, we ought to drop the second "and," reading, "of the root of the fatness," the sense is that the rich flow of sap in which the wild olive par-takes does not belong to the wild olive itself, but is all drawn from the root.<p>The evidence for the omission of the second "and" is that of the Vatican, Sinaitic, and rescript Paris manuscript--a strong combination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the stock of a wild olive tree; cf. ch. Romans 11:24) <span class="cmt_word">wast grafted in among them, and wast made partaker with them of the root and the fatness of the olive tree, boast not against the branches. But if thou boastest, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee</span>. In thus addressing the Gentile in the second person singular, the apostle brings his warning home to any individual Gentile Christian who might be inclined to boast; though regarding him still as representing Gentile believers generally. They are compared to slips of the wild olive tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleaster</span>), which was unproductive (cf. "Infelix superat foliis oleaster amaris"), acquiring richness and fertility by being grafted into the cultivated tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleo</span>). Whether or not such a reversal of the usual system of grafting would have the imagined effect does not matter, as long as the illustration serves St. Paul's purpose well, and helps us to grasp, his conception. The common process is - <p><span class="accented">"... to marry<br />A gentle scion to the wildest stock,<br />And make conceive a bark of baser kind,<br />By bud of nobler race."</span> In the illustration before us a scion of wildest stock is supposed to be made to conceive through the stock of nobler race to which it is united. The selecting the olive tree for illustration is happy, inasmuch as it was not only a characteristic produce of Palestine, but also regarded as symbolical of a plant of grace; cf. <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, "I am a green olive tree in the house of God;" also <a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>. See also the parable of Jotham (<a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>), where the trees apply first to the olive tree to be their king; and observe also there the word "fatness," used here also by St. Paul: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; (LXX.). The "branches" against which the ingrafted scion is warned not to boast are not exclusively either the broken-off or the remaining ones, but, as the sequel shows, the natural branches of the tree generally. The Gentile Christian is not to contemn the race of Israel because so large a portion of it is at present apart from the Church and under judgment; for it is, after all, from the stock of Israel, into which he has been engrafted, that he derives all his own fertility. As to the Christian Church being ever regarded as derived from that of Israel, the fulfilment and outcome of the ancient covenant, see note on Romans 1:2; and cf. <a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, "For salvation is of the Jews." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
