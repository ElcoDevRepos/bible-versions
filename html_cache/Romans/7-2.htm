The Apostle Paul uses this analogy to illustrate the binding nature of the law. In Jewish tradition, as seen in the Torah, marriage was a covenant that could only be dissolved by death or a formal divorce. This reflects the permanence and seriousness of the marital bond. The law here refers to the Mosaic Law, which governed many aspects of life, including marriage. This phrase emphasizes the lifelong commitment expected in marriage, paralleling the binding nature of the law to those under it. The concept of being "bound" is also seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>, where Paul reiterates that a wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives.<p><b>But if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</b><br>Death is presented as the only natural means of dissolving the marriage covenant, which is consistent with both Jewish and Roman customs of the time. This release signifies freedom from the legal obligations that were once binding. In the broader theological context, Paul uses this analogy to explain how believers are released from the law through the death of Christ, allowing them to belong to another, namely Christ, who was raised from the dead (<a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>). This release from the law is a key theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, where Christ redeems believers from the curse of the law. The concept of being "released" is significant in understanding the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/married_woman.htm">Married Woman</a></b><br>Represents believers who are bound by the law, illustrating the relationship between law and grace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>Symbolizes the law to which the believer is bound until death, representing the old covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>The event that releases the woman from the law, symbolizing the believer's release from the law through Christ's death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_law's_purpose.htm">Understanding the Law's Purpose</a></b><br>The law serves as a guide to reveal sin, but it is not the means of salvation.

The Law is here represented by the husband, but the Apostle does not mean to say that the Law dies to the Christian, but the Christian to the Law. The proposition must therefore be understood to be stated in a somewhat abstract form. Relations of the kind indicated are terminated <span class= "ital">by death</span> (not necessarily the death of one party to them more than another). The relation of wife and husband ceases absolutely and entirely on both sides, and not merely so much of it as affects the person who dies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (this is an instance of the application of the general principle, adduced as suiting the subject in band) <span class="cmt_word">the woman that hath an husband</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, implying subjection, meaning properly, <span class="accented">that is under an husband</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is bound to her living husband; but if the husband die, she is loosed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; cf. ver. 6 and <a href="/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>. The word expresses the entire abolition of the claim of the husband's law over her) <span class="cmt_word">from the law of the husband. So then if, while the husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the Law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit unto God</span>. The general drift of the above verses is plain enough; namely, that, as in all cases death frees a man from the claims of human law, and, in particular, as death frees the wife from the claims of marital law, so that she may marry again, so the death of Christ, into which we were baptized, frees us from the claims of the law which formerly bound us, so that we may be married spiritually to the risen Saviour, apart from the old dominion of law, and consequently of sin. But it is not so easy to explain the intended analogy in precise terms, there being an apparent discrepance between the illustration and the application with regard to the parties supposed to die. Even before the application there is a seeming discrepance of this kind between the general statement of ver. 1 and the instance given in ver. 2. For in ver. 1 it is (according to the view we have taken of it) the death of the person who had been under law that frees him from it, whereas in ver. 2 it is the death of the husband (representing law) that frees the wife from the law she had been under. Hence the interpretation of ver. 1 above referred to, according to which <span class="accented">law</span>, and not a <span class="accented">man</span>, is the understood nominative to <span class="accented">liveth.</span> But, even if this interpretation were considered tenable, we should not thus get rid of the subsequent apparent discrepance between the illustration and the application. For in the former it is the death of the husband that frees the wife; whereas in the latter it seems to be the death of ourselves, who answer to the wife, in the death of Christ, that frees us. For that it is ourselves that are regarded as having died to the Law with Christ appears not only from other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> vers. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, in ch. 6.), but also, in the passage before us, from <span class="greek">&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 4, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 6. (The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Textus Receptus rests on no authority, being apparently only a conjecture of Beza's.) There are various ways of explaining. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That (notwithstanding the reasons against the supposition that have just been given) it is the <span class="accented">Law</span>, and not the <span class="accented">man</span>, that is conceived as having died in the death of Christ. <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a> and <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a> may be referred to as supporting this conception. Thus the illustration and the application are made to hang together, the law of the husband being regarded as having died in the husband's death, as <span class="accented">the Law</span> generally to us in Christ's death; and we have already seen how ver. 1 may be forced into correspondence. This view of the Law itself being regarded as having died has the weighty support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Ambrose, and other Greek Fathers. Chrysostom accounts for the apostle introducing a different conception in ver. 4: by suggesting that he avoided saying explicitly that the Law had died, for fear of wounding the Jews: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f6c;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. This explanation hardly commends itself as satisfactory; and besides, in addition to what has been already said, it may be observed that throughout the whole passage there is no phrase to suggest in itself the idea of the <span class="accented">Law's</span> death, but only of <span class="accented">some</span> death which emancipates from law (ver. I being taken in its natural sense, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, in ver. 4, being accepted as the undoubtedly true reading). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That in the illustration the wife is really supposed to die when the husband dies. The death of either party to the marriage-bond cancels it; and when one dies, the other virtually dies to the law that both were under. Thus the statement of principle in ver. 1, the particular illustration in vers. 2, 3, and the application are made to hang together. Meyer takes this view decidedly, and cites <a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, to show that the husband's death may be considered as implying the wife's death also. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That there is a discrepance between the illustration and the application, the husband being regarded as dying in the former, and ourselves, who represent the wife, in the latter; but that this is of no consequence; the idea, common to both, of <span class="accented">death</span> abrogating the claims of law being sufficient for the apostle's argument. Death, it may be said, however regarded in the application, is an ideal conception, and not an actual fact with respect to ourselves; and it is immaterial how it is regarded, as long as the idea comes out that through death, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ours in the death of Christ, we are freed from the dominion of law.
