The term "bold reminder" suggests that Paul is reiterating truths the Roman believers may already know but need to be reinforced. This reflects the pastoral role of Paul, who often revisited foundational teachings to ensure the church's stability. The use of "bold" indicates Paul's confidence in his apostolic authority and the importance of the message. This approach is consistent with other epistles where Paul addresses issues directly, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a> and <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, emphasizing the need for correction and encouragement.<p><b>because of the grace God has given me</b><br>Paul attributes his ability to write and instruct to the grace bestowed upon him by God. This grace refers to his calling as an apostle to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a> and <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7-8</a>. It underscores the divine empowerment and responsibility Paul feels in his ministry. The concept of grace is central to Paul's theology, emphasizing that his work is not by his own merit but through God's unmerited favor. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of grace as a gift from God, enabling believers to fulfill their God-given purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Romans.

In some passages the Apostle feels that he had gone beyond the modest limits which he might have seemed to mark out for himself by what he had just been saying. He had taken a liberty, but not too great a liberty. He had spoken to them rather pointedly at times, but he had been careful not to go too far. The reference may be supposed to be to exhortations such as those in Romans 13, 14, and in other parts of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">As putting you in mind.</span>--Another delicate expression. The Apostle has not been telling them of something that they did not know before, but merely reminding them of what they knew. And he claims the right to do this because of the special grace given to him as an Apostle. The Judaising section in the Church at Rome did not go so far as that in Galatia. It recognised the apostleship of St. Paul, and he knew that he could safely appeal to this recognition.<p><span class= "bld">Because of the grace.</span>--Comp.

Though the Church of Rome was not one of his own foundation, and he had no desire, there or elsewhere, to build on another man's foundation (ver. 20), yet his peculiar mission as apostle to the Gentiles gave him a claim to admonish them. The reason thus given is, it will be observed, a confirmation of the view, otherwise apparent, that the Roman Church consisted principally of Gentile believers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/15-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">However,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have written</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(egrapsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1125.htm">Strong's 1125: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to 'grave', especially to write; figuratively, to describe.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
