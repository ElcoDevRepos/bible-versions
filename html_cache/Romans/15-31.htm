Judea was a region with a strong Jewish presence, and many Jews were hostile to the Christian message, viewing it as a threat to their religious traditions. This reflects the tension between early Christians and Jewish authorities, as seen in <a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-36</a>, where Paul faces opposition in Jerusalem. The request for prayer underscores the power of intercession and the spiritual warfare faced by early Christians. It also highlights Paul's reliance on God's protection and the support of the Christian community.<p><b>and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there</b><br>Paul's service refers to the collection he was bringing to the Jerusalem church, gathered from Gentile believers in Macedonia and Achaia (<a href="/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>). This collection was a tangible expression of unity between Jewish and Gentile Christians, addressing the economic needs of the Jerusalem church. The acceptance of this gift was crucial for fostering unity and demonstrating the fruit of the Gospel among Gentiles. The term "saints" refers to the believers in Jerusalem, emphasizing their set-apart status in Christ. This phrase also reflects Paul's desire for harmony and mutual acceptance within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Christ is described as breaking down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Romans, seeking prayer for his safety and the success of his mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelievers_in_judea.htm">Unbelievers in Judea</a></b><br>Refers to those in Judea who opposed Paul's message and mission, often leading to persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Paul intended to deliver the collection for the saints, a central place for early Christianity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints_in_jerusalem.htm">Saints in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The early Christian believers in Jerusalem, many of whom were in need due to persecution and poverty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act Paul requests from the Roman believers, highlighting the importance of intercessory prayer in the Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercessory_prayer.htm">The Power of Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s request for prayer underscores the belief in the power of intercession.
