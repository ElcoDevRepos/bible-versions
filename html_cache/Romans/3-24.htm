In the Greco-Roman world, justification was a legal term, meaning to be declared righteous or acquitted. In the biblical context, it signifies being declared righteous by God. This justification is "freely" given, emphasizing that it is not earned by human effort or merit. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that salvation is a gift from God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The idea of being justified freely underscores the grace and generosity of God, contrasting with the works-based righteousness that was prevalent in Jewish law and other religious systems of the time.<p><b>by His grace</b><br>Grace is a fundamental attribute of God, referring to His unmerited favor towards humanity. In the Old Testament, grace is often associated with God's covenantal faithfulness and mercy (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). In the New Testament, grace is personified in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's favor and love. Theologically, grace is the means by which God provides salvation, underscoring that it is not based on human actions but on God's initiative. This grace is transformative, leading to a new life in Christ (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a>).<p><b>through the redemption</b><br>Redemption in the biblical sense refers to the act of buying back or liberating someone from bondage or slavery. In the Old Testament, the concept is vividly illustrated in the Exodus narrative, where God redeems Israel from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). In the New Testament, redemption is achieved through Jesus Christ, who liberates humanity from the bondage of sin and death. This redemption is a fulfillment of the messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who bears the sins of many.<p><b>that is in Christ Jesus</b><br>The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is a key Pauline expression, denoting the believer's union with Christ. This union is both legal and relational, signifying that believers are incorporated into the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. It is through this union that believers receive the benefits of Christ's redemptive work. Theologically, being "in Christ" means sharing in His righteousness, life, and inheritance (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>). This concept is central to understanding the Christian identity and the transformative power of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the Messiah and the means through which redemption and justification are provided to believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/justification.htm">Justification</a></b><br>A legal term used in the New Testament to describe the act of God declaring a sinner righteous through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>A term that refers to the act of buying back or liberating someone, often used in the context of Christ's sacrificial death freeing believers from sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_justification.htm">Understanding Justification</a></b><br>Justification is a legal declaration by God that a person is righteous.

The bondage is the state of sin and of guilt, with the expectation of punishment; the deliverance is the removal of this state, and the opening out, in its stead, of a prospect of eternal happiness and glory; the equivalent paid by Christ is the shedding of His own blood. This last is the pivot upon which the whole idea of redemption turned. It is therefore clear that the redemption of the sinner is an act wrought objectively, and, in the first instance, independently of any change of condition in him, though such a change is involved in the appropriation of the efficacy of that act to himself. It cannot be explained as a purely subjective process wrought in the sinner through the influence of Christ's death. The idea of dying and reviving with Christ, though a distinct aspect of the atonement, cannot be made to cover the whole of it. There is implied, not only a change in the recipient of the atonement, but also a change wrought without his co-operation in the relations between God and man. There is, if it may be so said, in the death of Christ something which determines the will of God, as well as something which acts upon the will of man. And the particular influence which is brought to bear upon the counsels of God is represented under the figure of a ransom or payment of an equivalent. This element is too essentially a part of the metaphor, and is too clearly established by other parallel metaphors, to be explained away; though what the terms "propitiation" and "equivalent" can mean, as applied to God, we do not know, and it perhaps does not become us too curiously to inquire. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 23.

The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) here used may indeed sometimes denote <span class="accented">deliverance</span> only (cf. <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>); but certainly, when used of the redemption of man by Christ, it implies <span class="accented">atonement</span> by the payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; the ransom paid being said to be <span class="accented">himself</span>, or (as in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>) <span class="accented">his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It does not follow that all conceptions of schools of theology as to how the atonement was efficacious for its purpose are correct or adequate. It must, from the very nature of the subject, remain to us a mystery. It may be enough for us to believe that whatever need the human conscience has ever felt of atonement for sin, whatever human want was expressed by world-wide rites of sacrifice, whatever especially was signified by the blood required for atonement in the Mosaic ritual, - all this is met and fulfilled for us in Christ's offering of himself, and that in him and through him we may now "come boldly to the throne of grace," having need of no other <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x2e;</span> 25 ("set forth," Authorized Version), may bear here its most usual classical sense of <span class="accented">exhibiting to view</span> ("ante omniam oculos possuit," Bengel); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the historical manifestation of the Redeemer. It may, however, mean "decreed," or "purposed" (cf. ch. 1:13; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems best taken as a neuter adjective used substantively, there being no instance of its application in the masculine to a person. Its ordinary use in the LXX (as also <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) is to designate the lid of the ark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mercy-seat), the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (which is added <a href="/exodus/25-17.htm">Exodus 25:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6</a>) being supposed to be always understood, though the usual designation is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Hence most commentators, including the Greek Fathers generally, understood <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in this sense here, Christ being regarded as the antitype of the mercy-seat, as being the medium of atonement and approach to God. The main objection to this view is that it involves an awkward confusion of metaphors, it being difficult to regard him who was at once the Victim whose blood was offered, and the High Priest who offered his own blood, <span class="accented">at the</span> mercy-seat, as being also the Mercy-seat itself. (Thus, however, Theodoret explains: "The mercy-seat of old was itself <span class="accented">bloodless, being</span> without life, but it received the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice. But the Lord Christ and God is at once Mercy-seat, High Priest, and Lamb.") The difficulty is avoided if we take the word here in the sense of <span class="accented">propitiatory offering</span>, which in itself it will bear, a noun, such as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, being supposed to be (cf. 4 Maccabees 17:22; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 16. c. 7; Dio Chrys., 'Orat.,' 11:1). Whatever its exact meaning, it evidently denotes a true fulfilment in Christ of the atonement for sin undoubtedly signified by the type; as does further <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which follows. For a distinct enunciation of the significance of bleed under the ancient ritual, as reserved for and expressing atonement, see especially <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. The meaning of the whole sacrificial ritual is there expressed as being that the life of man being forfeit to Divine justice, blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. Hence, in pursuance of this idea, the frequent references in the New Testament to Hebrews physical <span class="accented">blood-shedding</span> of Christ (cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"). It is not, however, implied that the material blood of Christ, shed on the cross, in itself cleanses the soul from sin, but only that it signifies to us the fulfilment in him of the type of an atoning sacrifice. As to the construction of ver. 25, it is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is to be taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, meaning "through faith in his blood" (an unusual expression, though grammatically correct, cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>), or with <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, such as apparently to signify "in his own blood," favours the latter connection (cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-25</a>, where the offering of Christ is distinguished from those of the Law in being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Thus the meaning will be that he was set forth (or purposed) as an <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, available for us through faith, and consisting in the offering of himself - in, the shedding of his own blood. <span class="cmt_word">For showing of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime in the forbearance of God, in order to the showing of his righteousness in the time that now is, so that he may be righteous, and justifying</span> (the word is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> preceding) <span class="cmt_word">him that is of faith in Jesus</span>. This translation differs materially from that of the Authorized Version, which is evidently erroneous, especially in the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by "for the remission." Our translators, in a way very unusual with them, seem to have missed the drift of the passage, and so been led to give the above untenable rendering in order to suit their view of it. It is to be observed that two purposes of the <span class="accented">setting forth</span> (or <span class="accented">purposing</span>) of Christ Jesus as <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> here declared, both denoted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is repeated, being governed in the first clause of the sentence by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and in the second by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>. Some say that the preposition is changed with no intended difference of meaning. But it is not St. Paul's way to use his prepositions carelessly. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause may be taken to denote the immediate purpose of the propitiation, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the second to have its proper significance of <span class="accented">aim</span> or <span class="accented">direction</span>, denoting a further intention and result, consequent on the first. The first purpose, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, was the vindication of God's righteousness with regard to the ages past, in that he had so long <span class="accented">passed over</span>, or left unvisited, the sins of mankind. The propitiation of Christ. at length <span class="accented">set forth</span> (or, as may be expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, all along <span class="accented">purposed</span>), showed that he had not been indifferent to these sins, though <span class="accented">in his forbearance</span> he had passed them over. Cf. <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; also <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, where the death of Christ, as the Mediator of the new covenant, is said to have been "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant," the meaning and efficacy of the "death" being thus regarded, in the first place, as retrospective (cf. also <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). But then there was a further grand purpose, expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the second clause that of providing a way of present justification for believers now, without derogation of the Divine righteousness. Such appears to be the meaning of this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and are] justified</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dikaioumenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1344.htm">Strong's 1344: </a> </span><span class="str2">From dikaios; to render just or innocent.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">freely</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#969;&#961;&#949;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;rean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1432.htm">Strong's 1432: </a> </span><span class="str2">As a free gift, without payment, freely.
