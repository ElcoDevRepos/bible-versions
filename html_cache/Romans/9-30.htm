In the context of the early church, this group was often seen as outsiders to the covenant promises given to Israel. The inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan of salvation was a radical concept, challenging Jewish expectations and highlighting the universal scope of the gospel.<p><b>who did not pursue righteousness,</b><br>Historically, Gentiles were not given the Law of Moses and thus did not actively seek righteousness through it.

It contrasts with the Jewish pursuit of righteousness through adherence to the Law, which was central to their identity and religious practice.<p><b>have obtained it,</b><br>This indicates a completed action, emphasizing the surprising reality that Gentiles have received what they did not actively seek.

He now takes up a point of view which is the direct opposite of this, and in explaining the <span class= "ital">causes</span> which led to the rejection of Israel, those which he puts forward are all such as depend for their validity on the freedom of the will. It is needless to say that this is abundantly recognised in other parts of St. Paul's writings, especially in the earnest practical exhortations which he addresses to his readers. This, then, must be taken to qualify the argument that has preceded. The freedom of the will and the absolute sovereignty of God are two propositions which, though apparently contradictory, are both really true at one and the same time. When stated singly, each is apt to appear one-sided. They are reconciled, as it were, beneath the surface, in some way inscrutable to us. Both rest on evidence that in itself is incontrovertible.<p>The great reason for the rejection of Israel and for the admission of the Gentiles is that the Gentiles did, and that they did not, base their attempts at righteousness upon faith. Righteousness is the middle term which leads to salvation. The Gentiles, without seeking, found; the Jews, seeking in a wrong way, failed to find it.<p>(30) <span class= "bld">Which followed not after righteousness.</span>--Not having a special revelation, and being inattentive to the law of conscience.<p><span class= "bld">Attained</span> <span class= "bld">to</span> <span class= "bld">righteousness.</span>--By accepting the offer of Christianity, and especially the Christian doctrine of justification by faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30</span> - <a href="/romans/10-21.htm">Romans 10:21</a>. - (3) The cause <span class="accented">is in the fault of the Jews themselves.</span> Hitherto the apostle has viewed his subject from the side of the Divine will and purpose (see note on ver. 19). He now views it from the side of human responsibility. The rejection of the Jews is now attributed, not to God's purpose to reject them, but to their own fault, in that they would not accept God's terms. "Hic expresse ponit causam reprobationis, quia scilicet nolint credere Evangelio. Ideo supra dixi, similitudinem de luto non ira accipiendam esse quasi non sit in ipsa voluntate hominis causa reprobationis" (Melancthon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then!

The idea is resumed in ch. 10:3.
