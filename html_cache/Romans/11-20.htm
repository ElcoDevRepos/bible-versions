In the context of <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, Paul is addressing the Gentile believers about the state of Israel. The "correctness" refers to the fact that Israel's unbelief led to their being "broken off" from the olive tree, a metaphor for God's covenant people.<p><b>They were broken off because of unbelief:</b><br>The "they" refers to the Jewish people who did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. This breaking off is a metaphorical expression indicating their separation from the blessings and promises of God due to their lack of faith. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where unbelief often led to Israel's downfall (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>). The imagery of the olive tree is significant in Jewish culture, symbolizing peace and prosperity, and is used here to illustrate the spiritual heritage from which they were severed.<p><b>But you stand by faith:</b><br>Paul contrasts the unbelief of some Jews with the faith of the Gentile believers. The "you" refers to the Gentiles who have been grafted into the olive tree, symbolizing their inclusion in God's covenant through faith in Christ. This echoes the theme of justification by faith found throughout Romans (e.g., <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>). The standing by faith emphasizes the grace of God, as it is not by works or heritage that one is included in God's people, but by faith alone.<p><b>Do not be arrogant, but be afraid:</b><br>Paul warns the Gentile believers against pride. The temptation to look down on the Jews for their unbelief is countered by a call to humility and reverence. This warning is consistent with biblical teachings on humility (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The fear mentioned here is not terror but a reverent awe of God, recognizing His sovereignty and the grace that allows them to stand. It serves as a reminder of the potential for falling away if one does not continue in faith, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings. In <a href="/bsb/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, he addresses the relationship between Israel and the Gentiles in God's salvation plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God in the Old Testament, Israel plays a central role in Paul's discussion in <a href="/bsb/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>. Paul speaks about the spiritual state of Israel and their temporary hardening.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are now included in God's salvation plan. Paul discusses how the Gentiles have been grafted into the spiritual blessings originally given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_the_foundation.htm">Faith as the Foundation</a></b><br><a href="/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a> states, "That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid." This highlights the importance of faith as the foundation of our relationship with God. Without faith, we risk being cut off from the spiritual blessings God offers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_salvation.htm">Humility in Salvation</a></b><br>The warning against arrogance reminds us that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of our own merit. We should approach our faith with humility, recognizing that it is by God's grace that we stand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_unbelief.htm">The Danger of Unbelief</a></b><br>The original Greek word for "unbelief" (apistia) underscores the seriousness of rejecting faith.

Gentiles now stand only by faith, a grace-gift that leaves no room for pride. Instead of boasting, believers cultivate a humble, reverent fear&#8212;aware that perseverance in faith is essential. This passage calls every follower of Jesus to gratitude, humility, and ongoing trust in the Savior. (For personal guidance, seek counsel from mature believers or pastoral leadership.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Well</span> - the fact of the case is as you say; but why? - <span class="cmt_word">because of unbelief they were broken off; and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee</span>. (So, rather than as in the Authorized Version, according to the best-supported readings.) Thou art on thy trial, as they were, and alike liable to be broken off for the like cause; their present rejection should inspire in thee, not boast-fullness, but fear. The question has been raised whether St. Paul (using, as he does, the terms <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) has now the election and final salvation of individuals in view, or still only the calling to a state of salvation of races or communities of men - of the Jewish race on the one hand, and Gentile Churches on the other. The whole purport of this section of the Epistle (ch. 9, 10, 11.) seems to demand the latter view. (As to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, see on ver. 17.) Besides, if by the broken-off branches were meant simply individual unbelievers, how could we explain their being "grafted in again" (vers. 23, 24), seeing that the contemplated restoration is regarded in vers. 25, 26 as something that is to take place in the possibly distant future, after "the fulness of the Gentiles" has come in? Thus this passage is really irrelevant to any doctrines about individual election and salvation that may have been built upon it. It is, however, important as confirming the general view of Divine election not being irrespective of the conditions of human faith and perseverance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That is correct:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kal&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2573.htm">Strong's 2573: </a> </span><span class="str2">Well, nobly, honorably, rightly.
