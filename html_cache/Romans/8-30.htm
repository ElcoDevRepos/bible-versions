This idea is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where believers are chosen before the foundation of the world. Predestination highlights God's foreknowledge and His intention to conform believers to the image of His Son, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>. It underscores the assurance of salvation, as God's plan is unchangeable and certain.<p><b>He also called</b><br>The calling of God refers to the effective call to salvation, where God draws individuals to Himself. This is not merely an invitation but a powerful summons that results in a response of faith. In <a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>, Jesus states that no one can come to Him unless the Father draws them, indicating the divine initiative in salvation. This calling is both personal and purposeful, leading to a transformed life in Christ.<p><b>those He called, He also justified</b><br>Justification is a legal term signifying a change in status before God, where the believer is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a central theme in Paul's writings, particularly in <a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>, where justification is described as a gift of grace through the redemption in Christ. It is based on the atoning work of Jesus, who bore the penalty for sin, allowing believers to be reconciled with God. Justification is immediate and complete, ensuring peace with God.<p><b>those He justified, He also glorified</b><br>Glorification is the final step in the process of salvation, where believers are fully conformed to the image of Christ. This future reality is assured and is often spoken of in the past tense to emphasize its certainty. <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a> speaks of the transformation of our lowly bodies to be like Christ's glorious body. Glorification includes the resurrection of the body and eternal life with God, fulfilling the hope of believers. It is the culmination of God's redemptive work, where His glory is fully revealed in His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who predestines, calls, justifies, and glorifies.

As <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a> says, He &#8220;called us with a holy calling&#8230; according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before time began.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He Called</b><p>- The same ones He predestined, &#8220;He also called.&#8221; This is more than a general invitation; it is the life-giving summons that awakens faith. Jesus illustrates it: &#8220;The sheep listen to His voice&#8230; He calls His own sheep by name and leads them out&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>- <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a> affirms, &#8220;God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son&#8230; is faithful.&#8221;<p>- The call guarantees a response because &#8220;He who calls you is faithful, and He will do it&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He Justified</b><p>- All whom He calls, &#8220;He also justified.&#8221; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a> states, &#8220;Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221;.<p>- Justification is God&#8217;s legal declaration that the believer is righteous, based solely on Christ&#8217;s finished work: &#8220;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>- Because it is God who justifies, &#8220;Who can bring an accusation against God&#8217;s elect?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>).

Each link is forged by God&#8217;s sovereign grace, ensuring that everyone He foreknows and chooses is summoned to faith, declared righteous, and ultimately brought into eternal glory. This truth anchors believers in unshakable confidence, fuels present perseverance, and directs our gaze toward the certain splendor that awaits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Predestinate.</span>--This is the term which seems most to interfere with human free-will. Foreknowledge does not interfere with free-will, because the foreknowledge, though prior in point of time, is posterior in the order of causation to the act of choice. A man does not choose a certain action because it is foreknown, but it is foreknown because he will choose it. Predestination (the word is not inadequately translated) appears to involve a more rigorous necessity. All we can say is that it must not be interpreted in any sense that excludes free-will. Free-will is a postulate on which all the superstructure of morals and religion must rest. The religious mind, looking back over the course by which it has been brought, sees in it predominating the hand of God; but however large the divine element in salvation may be, it must in the end be apprehended by faith, which is an act of free-will. And the subsequent actions of which faith is the moving cause, though done under a co-operating divine influence, yet belong to the sphere of human freedom. (See Note on <a href="/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6</a>.) It should be remembered that St. Paul is not now writing in the calm temper of philosophical analysis, but in an intense access of religious emotion, and therefore he does not stay to put in all the qualifying clauses that philosophy might require. It is well for mankind that he has done so. In all great and creative religious minds the consciousness of free-will has retired into the background.<p><span class= "bld">Called.</span>--By presenting to them the gospel, directly or indirectly, through the preaching of Christ and His Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Justified.</span>--In the Pauline sense, as in <a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span><p><span class= "bld">Glorified.</span>--Strictly, the glorifying of the Christian awaits him in the future, but the Apostle regards all these different acts as focused together as it were on a single point in the past.
