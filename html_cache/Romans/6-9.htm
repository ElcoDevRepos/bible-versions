The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. The resurrection is historically supported by multiple accounts in the Gospels (Matthew 28, <a href="/mark/16.htm">Mark 16</a>, <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, <a href="/john/20.htm">John 20</a>) and is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. The resurrection is also a type of the firstfruits, as Paul explains in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, indicating that Christ's resurrection is the first of many to come.<p><b>He cannot die again</b><br>This phrase underscores the permanence of Christ's victory over death. Unlike Lazarus or others who were raised from the dead only to die again, Christ's resurrection is eternal. This is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where the Messiah is described as a priest forever. Theologically, this signifies the completion of His sacrificial work, as <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27-28</a> explains that Christ's sacrifice was once for all, never to be repeated.<p><b>death no longer has dominion over Him</b><br>This phrase highlights the defeat of death's power through Christ's resurrection. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, where death was seen as the ultimate end, this statement is revolutionary. It reflects the promise in <a href="/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>, where God declares He will ransom His people from the power of the grave. In <a href="/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>, Paul echoes this victory, proclaiming that death has lost its sting. This dominion language also connects to the concept of Jesus as the second Adam, as described in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a>, where Christ reverses the curse brought by the first Adam.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose resurrection is the foundation of Christian faith.
