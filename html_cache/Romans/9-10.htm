Her children, Jacob and Esau, represent two nations and two peoples, as foretold in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>.

This underscores the principle that God's election is not dependent on human lineage or works.<p><b>our father Isaac</b><br>Isaac is a patriarch in the lineage of the Israelites, the son of Abraham and Sarah. His role as the father of Jacob and Esau is crucial in the unfolding of God's covenant promises.

Now he intensifies the point: what follows is an additional, even clearer illustration. By saying &#8220;Not only that,&#8221; he invites us to lean in and see God&#8217;s purpose in election on an even tighter stage. Just as <a href="/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21-22</a> shows Abraham&#8217;s faith magnifying grace, here Paul shows that God&#8217;s choice is rooted in His own promise, not in human distinction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Rebecca&#8217;s children</b><p>Rebecca carried twins (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21-23</a>). Same mother, same pregnancy, same covenant household&#8212;yet God treated the boys differently. This removes any idea that lineage alone or personal merit directs divine favor. It echoes <a href="/galatians/4-28.htm">Galatians 4:28-29</a>, where those &#8220;born according to the Spirit&#8221; are set apart by promise. Paul wants readers to see that salvation history moves on God&#8217;s timetable, not family tradition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were conceived by one man</b><p>Both children share Isaac&#8217;s DNA and upbringing. The apostle underlines it to rule out paternal differences as a factor. <a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17-18</a> reminds us that Isaac was the son through whom &#8220;your offspring will be reckoned.&#8221; If both boys arise from the very man of promise, any later divergence must come from God&#8217;s sovereign will, not from human distinctives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>our father Isaac</b><p>Calling Isaac &#8220;our father&#8221; ties Jewish readers (and believing Gentiles grafted in, <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>) to the patriarchal covenant. <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-5</a> records God&#8217;s oath to bless Isaac&#8217;s descendants &#8220;because Abraham obeyed My voice.&#8221; In <a href="/bsb/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, Paul shows that the covenant line continues&#8212;not by automatic birthright but through God&#8217;s discerning love. This prepares the way for verses 11-13, where Jacob is loved and Esau hated before they had &#8220;done anything good or bad.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10</a> drives home the truth that God&#8217;s saving choice rests in His promise alone. By highlighting twins from one mother and one father within the covenant family, Paul strips away every human factor and magnifies the freedom of divine grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10, 11) Nor was the restriction and special selection confined to the case of Abraham alone. It also appeared when Rebecca bore sons to Isaac. It was indeed <span class= "ital">pure</span> selection. The children themselves had done nothing to make a preference be given to one over the other. There was no merit in the case. The object of the declaration was to ratify the divine electing purpose which had already chosen Jacob to be the inheritor of the Messianic blessings.<p>Here we have the doctrine of election and predestination stated in a very unqualified and uncompromising form. And it does indeed necessarily follow from one train of thought. However much we lay stress on freewill, still actions are the result of character--the will itself is a part of character; and character is born in us. Of the two elements which go to determine action, outward circumstances, and inward disposition, neither can be said strictly to be made by the man himself. If we follow this train of thought, then it would certainly appear that God, or the chain of natural causes set in motion and directed by God, made him what he is. In other words, he is elected and predetermined to a certain line of conduct. This is the logic of one set of inferences. On the other hand, the logic of the other set of inferences is just as strong--that man is free. There is an opposition irreconcilable to us with our present means of judging. We can only take the one proposition as qualified by the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But not only this; but Rebecca also, when she had conceived by one, even by Isaac our father</span>.
