In the context of the Roman church, this serves as a model for believers to prioritize others over personal desires. The Gospels frequently depict Jesus as one who came to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>), and His life exemplifies humility and obedience to the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). This self-denial is a call for Christians to emulate Christ's example in their interactions with others, promoting unity and love within the body of Christ.<p><b>but as it is written:</b><br>This introduction to a quotation underscores the authority of Scripture. Paul often uses Old Testament references to validate his teachings, showing continuity between the Old and New Testaments. This method of teaching was common in Jewish tradition, where the Scriptures were the foundation for understanding God's will and actions. By using this phrase, Paul connects the life and mission of Jesus to the prophetic writings, affirming that Christ's actions were in fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>&#8220;The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.&#8221;</b><br>This quotation is from <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>, a Messianic psalm that portrays the suffering of a righteous servant. In its original context, the psalmist expresses the burden of bearing reproach for God's sake. Paul applies this to Christ, who bore the scorn and rejection of humanity as part of His redemptive work. This connection to the psalm highlights Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the suffering servant motif found throughout the Old Testament, particularly in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. It also reflects the idea of substitutionary atonement, where Christ takes upon Himself the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. This passage encourages believers to endure hardships for the sake of the Gospel, knowing that Christ has already borne the ultimate insult and suffering on their behalf.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, Jesus Christ is the Son of God who came to earth to fulfill God's plan of salvation.

Jesus Himself lived that way.<p>&#8226; Throughout His earthly ministry the Lord consistently sidelined personal comfort:<p>&#8211; &#8220;The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;I seek not My own will but the will of Him who sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>).<p>&#8211; He &#8220;emptied Himself&#8230; becoming obedient to death&#8212;even death on a cross&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; By spotlighting Christ&#8217;s self-denial, Paul presses us toward the same posture&#8212;bearing with the weak, sacrificing preferences, and choosing love over liberty (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but as it is written</b><p>&#8226; Paul immediately anchors his appeal in Scripture, underscoring that Christian ethics flow from God&#8217;s revealed Word, not human opinion (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>; <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase signals that what follows is not a mere illustration; it is prophecy fulfilled, confirming both the Messiah&#8217;s mission and the authority of the Old Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Quoted from <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>.
