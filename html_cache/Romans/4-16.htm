Faith, rather than works or adherence to the law, is emphasized as the means by which this promise is received. This aligns with <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where Abraham's belief in God is credited to him as righteousness. The concept of faith as the vehicle for receiving God's promises is central to Paul's argument in Romans, contrasting with the Jewish emphasis on the law.<p><b>so that it may rest on grace</b><br>Grace is unmerited favor from God, highlighting that the promise is a gift rather than something earned. This underscores the New Testament teaching that salvation is by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The idea of grace ensures that the promise is accessible to all, not limited by human effort or status.<p><b>and may be guaranteed to all Abraham&#8217;s offspring</b><br>The guarantee of the promise extends beyond ethnic Israel to include all who share the faith of Abraham. This broadens the scope of God's covenant, fulfilling the prophecy that Abraham would be the father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-5</a>). It reflects the inclusivity of the gospel message, which breaks down barriers between Jew and Gentile.<p><b>not only to those who are of the law</b><br>This phrase refers to the Jewish people who received the law through Moses. While the law was given to guide and set apart Israel, Paul argues that it is not the means by which the promise is secured. This challenges the prevailing Jewish thought of the time, which held the law as central to righteousness and covenantal relationship with God.<p><b>but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham</b><br>Here, Paul includes Gentiles who, like Abraham, believe in God and His promises. This faith-based inclusion fulfills the promise that all nations would be blessed through Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It emphasizes the universality of the gospel and the breaking down of ethnic and religious barriers.<p><b>He is the father of us all</b><br>Abraham is presented as the spiritual father of all believers, both Jew and Gentile. This spiritual lineage is based on faith, not ethnicity or adherence to the law. It reflects the unity of believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>, where Paul states that all are one in Christ Jesus and heirs according to the promise. This concept of spiritual fatherhood underscores the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A key patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Paul confirms it: &#8220;Those who have faith are sons of Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). Thus every believer, Jew or Gentile, stands in the family line of faith, inheriting the righteousness God credited to Abraham.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16</a> teaches that salvation is secured by faith, rooted in grace, and extended to every person who believes as Abraham believed. Because God Himself guarantees the promise, all who trust in Christ&#8212;whether Jew or Gentile&#8212;share in the blessings promised to Abraham and become part of the same redeemed family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Therefore it is of faith.</span>--The words "it is" have to be supplied. "It" stands for the Messianic inheritance, or, in common phrase, salvation. Faith on man's part is correlative with grace on the part of God, and salvation being thus dependent upon grace is as wide and universal as grace itself. It knows no restriction of law.<p><span class= "bld">Not to that only which is of the law.</span>--Not only to that part of the human race which belongs to the dispensation of the Law, but also to that which is in a spiritual sense descended from Abraham by imitating his faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore it is of faith, that it may be according to grace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as in ver. 4); <span class="cmt_word">to the end the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all, (as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee,) before him whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth the things that are not as though they were.</span> Ver. 16 introduces no new thought, being but a summing up of what has been said, except that, in ver. 17, the text <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a> is adduced in support of the extended sense in which "the seed of Abraham" has been understood. In ver. 17, too, the thought is introduced of how Abraham evinced his faith; and this with a view of showing it to have been in essence the same as the justifying faith of Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the promise comes]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
