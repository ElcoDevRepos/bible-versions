In the early church, encouragement was vital for the growth and perseverance of believers facing persecution. Barnabas, known as the "son of encouragement" (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), exemplified this gift by supporting Paul and others. Encouragement is not merely about positive words but involves strengthening others in their faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, which urges believers to spur one another on toward love and good deeds. This gift reflects the comforting nature of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, who comes alongside believers to support and guide them.<p><b>if it is giving, let him give generously;</b><br>Generosity is a hallmark of Christian living, reflecting God's own generosity in giving His Son for humanity (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The early church practiced communal sharing, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers sold possessions to meet each other's needs. Giving is not limited to financial resources but includes time, talents, and hospitality. The Macedonian churches are commended for their generosity despite their poverty (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-5</a>). Generosity is an act of worship and trust in God's provision, as taught in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-7</a>, where cheerful giving is encouraged.<p><b>if it is leading, let him lead with diligence;</b><br>Leadership in the church requires diligence, a commitment to hard work and perseverance. Biblical leaders like Moses and Nehemiah demonstrated diligence in guiding God's people through challenges. Leadership is a service, not a position of power, as Jesus taught in <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>, where He emphasized servant leadership. Diligence involves being proactive, responsible, and attentive to the needs of the flock, as seen in the qualifications for overseers in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>. Leaders are accountable to God for their stewardship and must lead by example, as Peter instructs in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>.<p><b>if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.</b><br>Mercy is a reflection of God's compassion and forgiveness, as demonstrated in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>). Showing mercy involves acts of kindness and forgiveness, often to those who may not deserve it. The cheerful aspect of mercy highlights the attitude with which it should be extended, echoing the joy of the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>). Mercy is a key aspect of the Beatitudes, where Jesus blesses the merciful (<a href="/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>). It is a reminder of the mercy believers have received from God and are called to extend to others, as seen in <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>, which warns that judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the capital of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_gifts.htm">Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a> is a discussion on the various spiritual gifts given to believers for the edification of the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_encouragement.htm">The Gift of Encouragement</a></b><br>Encouragement is a vital ministry within the church.

This last form of address, corresponding perhaps rather to our word "encouragement," would be especially needed in the troubled circumstances of the early Church.<p><span class= "bld">He that giveth.</span>--In this and the following phrases the Apostle passes on from considering the definite functions of the ministry to those which were common to all members of the Church; "giveth" is therefore here to be taken in a wide sense.<p><span class= "bld">Simplicity.</span>--With singleness of motive, desiring only God's glory, and to benefit the object for which he gives, and with no secret thought of self-exaltation.
