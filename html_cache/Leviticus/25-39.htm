The Mosaic Law provided various protections for the poor, emphasizing community responsibility. The term "countryman" indicates a fellow Israelite, highlighting the covenantal relationship among God's people. This reflects the broader biblical theme of caring for the needy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>, where Israelites are commanded to be generous to the poor.<p><b>and sells himself to you</b><br>In ancient Israel, selling oneself into servitude was a means of survival for those in dire financial straits. This was not slavery in the harsh sense but a form of indentured servitude. The individual retained certain rights and was to be treated with dignity. This practice is distinct from the slavery seen in other ancient cultures, where individuals had no rights. The Jubilee laws (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>) ensured that such servitude was temporary, with release in the Jubilee year.<p><b>then you must not force him into slave labor</b><br>The command here is to treat the destitute countryman with respect and not as a slave. This reflects God's justice and mercy, as He delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). The Hebrew term for "slave labor" implies harsh, oppressive work. This regulation underscores the value of every individual as made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>) and anticipates the New Testament teaching of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). The principle of treating others with dignity is a reflection of Christ's teaching and example, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, including the instructions in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, which were given to guide their community life and ensure justice and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society, occurring every 50 years, when slaves were to be freed, debts forgiven, and land returned to original owners, providing context for the laws in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassionate_treatment.htm">Compassionate Treatment</a></b><br>The law in <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a> emphasizes the importance of treating those in need with dignity and respect, reflecting God's compassion and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_human_dignity.htm">Value of Human Dignity</a></b><br>The prohibition against forcing a destitute brother into slave labor underscores the inherent value and dignity of every person, created in the image of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The Israelites were called to care for their fellow community members, highlighting the importance of mutual support and responsibility within the body of Christ today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_and_restoration.htm">Freedom and Restoration</a></b><br>The principles of the Jubilee year, including the release of servants, point to God's desire for freedom and restoration, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_generosity.htm">Practical Generosity</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to practice generosity and kindness, reflecting God's provision and care for His people, as seen in the laws given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_25_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 25:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_39_on_aiding_the_needy.htm">How does Leviticus 25:39 guide us in treating those in financial hardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_39_God_s_view_on_servitude.htm">What principles in Leviticus 25:39 reflect God's view on servitude and freedom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_39_and_Jesus_on_love.htm">How does Leviticus 25:39 connect to Jesus' teachings on loving others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Lev_25_39_apply_to_jobs_today.htm">In what ways can we apply Leviticus 25:39 to modern employment practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_39_Compassion_s_role.htm">How does Leviticus 25:39 emphasize the importance of compassion in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_39_vs_modern_human_rights.htm">How does Leviticus 25:39 align with modern views on human rights and servitude?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Leviticus_25_39_s_laws.htm">What historical context influenced the laws in Leviticus 25:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_Leviticus_25_39_today.htm">How should Leviticus 25:39 be interpreted in today's society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_lev_25_39-46_differ_on_servitude.htm">Why does the command to release servants (Lev 25:39&#8211;46) appear inconsistent with other biblical passages endorsing servitude?

"Thy servant my husband is dead; (and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord:) and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen" (<a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>). And in the time of Nehemiah, "Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.... And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards" (<a href="/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>). But the fact that an Israelite could not be kept in slavery for more than six years (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>), and that the period of his service had to be still shorter if the jubilee fell before the seventh year, and the further fact that at the time of the jubilee he would not only he free, but recover any ancestral property that he had forfeited, so that he might become once more on an equality with his master, would have made his position totally different from the hopeless, helpless state of the Greek or Roman slave, even without the positive command that he was to be treated, not <span class="cmt_word">as a bondservant:</span> but <span class="cmt_word">as an hired servant,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">as a sojourner.</span> All alike, master and bondsman, were the slaves of God, and therefore not only were they, so far, on an equality one with another, but the master would be encroaching on the right of God if he claimed God's slaves for his own inalienably. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
