This phrase indicates the priest's authority in determining the value of offerings dedicated to the Lord. The priest's judgment was considered divinely guided, reflecting the importance of spiritual discernment in matters of worship. This practice underscores the principle that offerings to God should be assessed with integrity and fairness, ensuring that they are worthy of the divine recipient. The priest's role here can be seen as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, discerning the true value of our spiritual sacrifices (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>whether high or low</b><br>This phrase suggests flexibility and fairness in the valuation process, acknowledging that not all offerings are of equal material worth. The priest's assessment was not arbitrary but based on the condition and quality of the item being dedicated. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God values the heart and intent behind the offering more than the offering itself (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also highlights the inclusivity of the sacrificial system, allowing individuals of varying economic statuses to participate in worship according to their means.<p><b>as the priest values it</b><br>The repetition of the priest's role emphasizes the trust placed in his judgment and the importance of his impartiality. This mirrors the biblical theme of justice and righteousness, where leaders are called to act without favoritism or corruption (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>). The priest's valuation was binding, reinforcing the idea that spiritual leaders are accountable to God for their decisions and must act with integrity.<p><b>the price will be set</b><br>Once the priest determined the value, it became the established price, indicating the finality and authority of the priest's decision. This reflects the order and structure within the Levitical system, where clear guidelines were established for worship and offerings. It also points to the concept of redemption, where a price is set for the dedication or consecration of something to God, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption price paid by Christ for humanity (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>In the context of Leviticus, the priest plays a crucial role in the religious and community life of Israel.

Verse 12 begins, &#8220;The priest shall set its value&#8230;&#8221;.<p>- God locates the authority to decide worth in the priest, not in the donor. This guards the sanctity of vows and prevents self-serving appraisals (cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>).<p>- The priest&#8217;s role pictures Christ, our great High Priest, who perfectly represents both God and man (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-25</a>).<p>- By giving the task to a God-appointed mediator, the valuation process stays rooted in divine standards, affirming that what belongs to God must be handled God&#8217;s way (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whether high or low</b><p>- The text continues, &#8220;whether high or low,&#8221; highlighting flexibility. Not every offering carries the same market value, so the priest weighs factors such as age, condition, and usefulness.<p>- Scripture consistently demands honest, balanced judgments (<a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-15.htm">Deuteronomy 25:15</a>). The phrase reminds us that God sees through every attempt either to inflate worth for pride or deflate worth for profit (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-4</a>).<p>- Fairness in worship matters because God is impartial (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). The range &#8220;high or low&#8221; underscores that true equity flows from divine character, not human whim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the priest values it</b><p>- Repetition stresses final authority: &#8220;as the priest values it.&#8221; Though the giver might have opinions, the priest&#8217;s verdict stands.<p>- This requirement trains hearts to submit&#8212;even in financial matters&#8212;to God-ordained leadership (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>- It also foreshadows the gospel truth that only the appointed Priest can set the price of redemption. We do not negotiate our own salvation; Christ determines and pays the cost (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the price will be set</b><p>- The verse concludes, &#8220;the price will be set.&#8221; Once the priest speaks, the valuation becomes binding. Vows are no casual matter (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p>- A fixed price prevents endless haggling and ensures the sanctuary receives its due in a timely way (<a href="/leviticus/27-8.htm">Leviticus 27:8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-16.htm">2 Kings 12:16</a>).<p>- Spiritually, this pictures the certainty of Christ&#8217;s finished work. &#8220;You were bought at a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). Nothing more can be added or subtracted; redemption is settled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/27-12.htm">Leviticus 27:12</a> teaches that whatever is vowed to God must be appraised by His appointed priest, whether the value ends up &#8220;high or low.&#8221; The priest&#8217;s judgment is final, establishing a set price that honors both the holiness of God and the integrity of the worshiper. The verse underscores divine ownership, honest assessment, respectful submission to God-given authority, and the unchangeable certainty of redemption secured by our ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Whether it be good or bad.</span>--That is, the priest shall estimate its value according to the condition of the animal, whatever that may be, whether it is of good quality or bad.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/27-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
