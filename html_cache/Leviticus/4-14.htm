In the context of ancient Israel, sin was not only a personal matter but also a communal concern. The awareness of sin implies a process of self-examination and communal accountability. This reflects the broader biblical theme of repentance and confession, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where acknowledgment of sin is a prerequisite for forgiveness.<p><b>then the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering</b><br>The requirement for the assembly to bring a young bull signifies the gravity of communal sin and the need for atonement. The young bull, being a valuable and significant offering, underscores the seriousness of sin and the cost of reconciliation with God. This practice is rooted in the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), who takes away the sin of the world. The communal aspect of the offering emphasizes the collective responsibility and unity of the people in seeking God's forgiveness.<p><b>and present it before the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. Presenting the offering before the Tent of Meeting signifies bringing the matter before God, acknowledging His holiness, and seeking His mercy. This act of presentation is a form of worship and submission to God's authority. The Tent of Meeting serves as a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who is described as the true Tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11</a>), where believers can approach God directly through His atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_of_israel.htm">The Assembly of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective body of the Israelites, representing the community as a whole.

Once the community &#8220;becomes aware,&#8221; accountability follows.<p>&#8226; This mirrors <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-26</a>, where unintentional sin is still real sin requiring atonement once recognized.<p>&#8226; Personal conviction operates the same way: &#8220;I acknowledged my sin to You&#8230;and You forgave the guilt of my sin&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>).<p>&#8226; In the New Covenant, the Spirit exposes wrongdoing (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>), driving us to confess and forsake it (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Awareness, therefore, is God&#8217;s grace: it opens the path to repentance rather than leaving people under unnoticed judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the Assembly Must Bring a Young Bull as a Sin Offering</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;assembly&#8221; (Israel as a whole) acts corporately; collective sin demands collective response (<a href="/leviticus/4-15.htm">Leviticus 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;young bull&#8221; is the costliest animal, underscoring the gravity of sin (compare <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a> for priestly sin).<p>&#8226; This sacrifice prefigures Christ, &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Substitution stands at the center: &#8220;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The requirement shows that forgiveness is never cheap; life must be given&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Jesus&#8217; blood (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Present It Before the Tent of Meeting</b><p>&#8226; Sacrifice is not offered anywhere the people choose; it must be brought &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; at His designated dwelling (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42-43</a>).<p>&#8226; This stresses God&#8217;s holiness and the necessity of approaching Him on His terms (<a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Priestly mediation is essential: the elders lay hands on the bull (<a href="/leviticus/4-15.htm">Leviticus 4:15</a>) and the priest applies the blood. This foreshadows our need for a greater High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Today every believer &#8220;draws near&#8221; through Christ alone, the one mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a> teaches that when God&#8217;s people finally recognize their collective sin, they must address it immediately, thoroughly, and God&#8217;s way. Awareness prompts repentance; a costly, substitutionary sacrifice secures forgiveness; and proper approach to God ensures acceptance. All three elements find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who reveals sin, offers Himself as the perfect offering, and brings us boldly into God&#8217;s presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Offer a young bullock.</span>--The same sacrifice which is prescribed for the sin of the high priest (comp. <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>), and though not expressed here, it must be without blemish.<p><span class= "bld">And bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">before the tent of meeting. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3</a>.) This no more means that the whole congregation or the thousands of Israelites are all to lay hold of the victim, and carry it to the appointed place of slaughter, than the phrase in <a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm" title="Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.">Leviticus 4:12</a> signifies that the high priest is himself to carry the bullock. It is the regular Hebrew idiom, which denotes that the people are to cause the sacrifice to be carried. We should have deemed it superfluous to explain this well-known mode of expression had it not been that mistaken arguments have been deduced from it.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">when they become aware</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7695;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
