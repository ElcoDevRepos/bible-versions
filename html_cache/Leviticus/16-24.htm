Bathing in a holy place signifies the separation from impurity and the preparation for sacred duties. This act of washing is symbolic of spiritual cleansing, a theme echoed in the New Testament, where baptism represents purification and new life (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The holy place, likely the tabernacle or a designated area within it, underscores the sanctity required for approaching God.<p><b>and put on his own clothes</b><br>After bathing, the high priest changes from the special linen garments worn during the Day of Atonement rituals back into his regular priestly attire. This change of clothing signifies a transition from the unique duties of the Day of Atonement back to his regular priestly functions. The garments symbolize the priest's role and identity, and the act of changing clothes reflects the completion of a specific sacred task. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, after completing His sacrificial work, returned to His glory (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).<p><b>Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people&#8217;s burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering, a sacrifice entirely consumed by fire, represents total dedication to God. The high priest offers a burnt offering for himself and another for the people, signifying the need for atonement and reconciliation with God. This dual offering highlights the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The act of going out to perform the sacrifice indicates the public nature of this ritual, reinforcing the communal aspect of atonement.<p><b>to make atonement for himself and for the people</b><br>Atonement involves the covering or removal of sin, restoring the relationship between God and humanity. The high priest's need to make atonement for himself underscores the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood, pointing to the necessity of a perfect high priest, Jesus Christ, who is sinless and able to make a once-for-all atonement (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>).
