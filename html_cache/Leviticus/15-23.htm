In ancient Israel, the bed and furniture were common household items, and their mention here underscores the pervasive nature of ritual impurity. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on purity laws, which were integral to maintaining holiness within the community. These laws served as a constant reminder of the need for spiritual cleanliness and separation from sin. The focus on everyday items like beds and furniture highlights the comprehensive nature of the purity laws, affecting all aspects of daily life.<p><b>whoever touches it will be unclean until evening</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the transmission of ritual impurity through contact. The concept of becoming unclean until evening reflects the temporary nature of this impurity, which could be resolved with the passage of time and appropriate purification rituals. The evening marked the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing renewal and the opportunity for restoration. This temporary uncleanness can be seen as a type of the separation caused by sin, which requires cleansing and atonement. The idea of impurity being resolved by evening points to the hope of redemption and the ultimate cleansing from sin through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers eternal purification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the laws of purity and cleanliness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_person.htm">Unclean Person</a></b><br>An individual who becomes ceremonially unclean through contact with certain objects or people, as described in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time by which the unclean person would be considered clean again, marking the end of the day in Jewish tradition.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ceremonial_cleanliness.htm">Understanding Ceremonial Cleanliness</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus were given to teach the Israelites about holiness and the separation from sin.

The same attention to holiness echoes in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, where every mundane activity is to glorify God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or furniture on which she was sitting</b><p>&#8226; The text expands the scope: chairs, cushions, or any surface that bears her weight share the same status (<a href="/leviticus/15-6.htm">Leviticus 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This inclusion prevents loopholes&#8212;God leaves no gray area when protecting the camp&#8217;s purity (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle reminds believers that sin&#8217;s reach can be broader than we assume, so <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a> calls for zero tolerance toward impurity &#8220;even to be named&#8221; among saints.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whoever touches it</b><p>&#8226; Uncleanness is transferable. Like <a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2</a> explains, touching an impure thing makes the person impure.<p>&#8226; The transfer highlights communal responsibility; one person&#8217;s condition affects another (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>, &#8220;A little leaven leavens the whole lump&#8221;).<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, the woman with the flow of blood touched Jesus&#8217; cloak (<a href="/mark/5-27.htm">Mark 5:27&#8211;30</a>). Her act showed faith, and Christ&#8217;s holiness overpowered impurity, illustrating His authority over the very laws given here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be unclean until evening</b><p>&#8226; The defilement is temporary but real. &#8220;They shall be unclean until evening; then they shall bathe and be clean&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Evening marked a new day in Hebrew reckoning; mercy was built into the regulation, pointing to God&#8217;s readiness to restore (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical steps&#8212;washing clothes, bathing (<a href="/leviticus/15-11.htm">Leviticus 15:11</a>)&#8212;taught that cleansing involves action, prefiguring the fuller cleansing found in Christ&#8217;s blood (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-23.htm">Leviticus 15:23</a> shows that holiness permeates every corner of life. Beds and seats, ordinary yet intimate, could convey impurity; anyone who touched them shared that status until sundown. The rule protected Israel&#8217;s worship and foreshadowed the deeper truth that sin spreads but can be cleansed. Temporary uncleanness pointed toward the perfect, permanent cleansing secured by Jesus, who confronted impurity and triumphed over it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And if it be on her bed.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and if any object be on her bed, </span>that is, if anything happen to lie on her bed.<p><span class= "bld">When he toucheth it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">if he toucheth it. </span>Whilst the former two verses declare that if any one touches the bed itself, or the thing on which she sat, he contracts such a degree of defilement that he must wash his clothes, bathe his whole body, and remain in a state of pollution till sundown, the verse before us enacts that if he happens to touch any vessel, garment, or any other objects which are lying on the defiling bed or seat in question, he has only to remain unclean till sundown, without having to wash his garments. The defilement in this case is not primary, but secondary. It is no more the bed or seat which defiled by direct contact, but an object which the defiled bed or seat had defiled, the pollution in this case being indirect.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/15-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and whether</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
