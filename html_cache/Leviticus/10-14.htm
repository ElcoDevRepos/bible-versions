The "breast of the wave offering" and the "thigh of the contribution" were parts of the peace offerings, which were shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer. The wave offering involved the priest waving the portion before the Lord, symbolizing its presentation to God and His acceptance. This practice highlights the provision for the priestly family, ensuring their sustenance as they served in the tabernacle. The inclusion of "sons and daughters" emphasizes the communal and familial aspect of worship and provision.<p><b>in a ceremonially clean place</b><br>The requirement for a "ceremonially clean place" underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity, which was central to the Levitical law. Eating in a clean place ensured that the sanctity of the offering was preserved. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, which is a recurring theme throughout Leviticus. The emphasis on cleanliness can be seen as a type pointing to the purity required by God, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the perfect High Priest.<p><b>because these portions have been assigned to you and your children</b><br>The assignment of these portions to the priests and their families was a divine ordinance, reflecting God's provision for those who ministered before Him. This allocation was not merely a practical measure but a sacred duty, reinforcing the idea that those who serve God are worthy of their sustenance. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul writes about the rights of those who preach the gospel to receive their living from it (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel</b><br>The peace offerings, also known as fellowship offerings, were unique in that they symbolized reconciliation and communion with God. They were voluntary offerings, expressing gratitude, vows, or freewill devotion. The "sons of Israel" refers to the entire community of God's people, indicating that the offerings were a collective act of worship. This communal aspect of the peace offerings points to the unity and fellowship among God's people, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament church, where believers are called to live in peace and unity through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest and brother of Moses, who is responsible for the priestly duties and rituals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_aaron.htm">Sons of Aaron</a></b><br>The priests who assist Aaron in the tabernacle duties and partake in the offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_place.htm">Holy Place</a></b><br>The designated area within the tabernacle where the priests are to consume the offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_made_by_fire.htm">Offerings Made by Fire</a></b><br>Sacrifices presented to the LORD, which include burnt offerings and peace offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/command_of_the_lord.htm">Command of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to Moses and Aaron regarding the conduct and rituals of the priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_service.htm">Holiness in Service</a></b><br>The consumption of offerings in a holy place underscores the importance of maintaining holiness in our service to God.
