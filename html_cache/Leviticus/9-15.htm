This role is significant in the Levitical priesthood, where the high priest represents the people before God. The presentation of the offering signifies the people's acknowledgment of their need for atonement and reconciliation with God. This act prefigures Christ, our High Priest, who presents Himself as the ultimate offering for humanity's sins.<p><b>He took the male goat for the people&#8217;s sin offering,</b><br>The male goat is chosen as the sin offering, which is a common practice in the Levitical sacrificial system. The goat symbolizes the transfer of the people's sins onto the animal, which is then sacrificed to atone for those sins. This foreshadows the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ, who takes upon Himself the sins of the world.<p><b>slaughtered it,</b><br>The act of slaughtering the goat is a vivid reminder of the seriousness of sin and the cost of atonement.

This sacrificial act points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, whose blood was shed for the remission of sins.<p><b>and offered it for sin like the first one.</b><br>The phrase "like the first one" refers to the earlier sin offering made for Aaron and his sons, emphasizing the need for repeated sacrifices under the Old Covenant. This repetition highlights the insufficiency of animal sacrifices to fully atone for sin, contrasting with the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.
