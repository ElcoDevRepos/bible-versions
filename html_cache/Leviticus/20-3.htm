In biblical terms, God setting His face against someone signifies divine disfavor and impending punishment. This is a serious declaration, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a>, where God&#8217;s face against Jerusalem signifies destruction. It reflects the personal nature of God's relationship with His people and His intolerance for idolatry.<p><b>and cut him off from his people</b><br>To be "cut off" implies a severe form of punishment, often understood as death or excommunication. This reflects the covenantal context of Israel, where communal purity was essential. The phrase underscores the seriousness of the offense and the need to maintain holiness within the community, as seen in <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a> regarding the covenant of circumcision.<p><b>because by giving his offspring to Molech</b><br>Molech worship involved child sacrifice, a practice abhorred by God. This phrase highlights the syncretism Israel was warned against, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>. Archaeological findings in the region, such as the Tophet in Carthage, provide evidence of such practices. The act was a direct violation of God&#8217;s commandments and a betrayal of the covenant relationship.<p><b>he has defiled My sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary, or tabernacle, was the dwelling place of God among His people. Defilement of the sanctuary indicates a breach in the sacred space where God&#8217;s presence resided. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, as seen in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, where God commands the building of the sanctuary so He may dwell among them. The act of idolatry contaminates the purity required for God&#8217;s presence.<p><b>and profaned My holy name</b><br>God&#8217;s name represents His character and reputation. To profane it is to treat it with irreverence or disrespect. This phrase emphasizes the importance of God&#8217;s holiness and the call for His people to reflect that holiness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. The act of sacrificing to Molech not only violated God&#8217;s law but also misrepresented His nature to the nations, contradicting the call to be a light to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His judgment against those who commit idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/molech.htm">Molech</a></b><br>A pagan deity associated with child sacrifice, worshiped by some neighboring cultures of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>An Israelite who has committed the sin of offering his offspring to Molech.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place of worship for the Israelites, which is defiled by the sin of idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The community from which the sinner is to be cut off, emphasizing the communal aspect of holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>God&#8217;s holiness demands that His people remain separate from pagan practices.

Hence some take it simply to express the same thing--that the judicial execution is God's mode of cutting off the sinner from his people. According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, however, the legislator supposes a case where the man has been actually guilty of the crime, and that there has not been a sufficient amount of evidence to convict him. In that case God himself would interpose and cut the offender off. This is more in accordance with what follows.<p><span class= "bld">To defile my sanctuary.</span>--By sinning, the Israelites contracted defilement, and they defiled the sanctuary which was in their midst.
