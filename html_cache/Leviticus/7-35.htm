In the Levitical system, offerings were divided into portions for God, the priests, and the offerer. This system ensured the sustenance of the priestly class, who had no land inheritance. The food offerings, or sacrifices, were a central part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and fellowship with God. The portion for the priests underscores their role as mediators between God and the people.<p><b>for Aaron and his sons</b><br>Aaron and his sons were chosen by God to serve as the priestly family, a role that was hereditary. This selection is rooted in the narrative of Exodus, where Aaron is appointed as the first high priest. The priesthood was a sacred office, and the priests were responsible for performing sacrifices, maintaining the sanctuary, and teaching the law. This lineage continued until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, and it highlights the importance of family and lineage in the biblical narrative.<p><b>since the day they were presented</b><br>This refers to the consecration of Aaron and his sons, which is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>. The presentation involved a series of rituals, including washing, anointing, and the offering of sacrifices. This consecration set them apart for their sacred duties. The concept of being "presented" to God is significant, as it implies a formal dedication and acceptance into divine service, a theme that resonates with the New Testament idea of presenting oneself as a living sacrifice (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>to serve the LORD as priests</b><br>The role of the priests was to serve God and the community by facilitating worship and maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Their service included offering sacrifices, teaching the law, and interceding for the people. This priestly service is a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The priesthood of Aaron and his sons foreshadows the perfect and eternal priesthood of Jesus, who mediates a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
