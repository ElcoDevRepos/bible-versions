The provision for those who could not afford a lamb demonstrates God's compassion and understanding of human circumstances. It reflects the principle that worship and atonement should be accessible to all, regardless of financial status. This inclusivity is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus commends the widow who gives two small coins (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><b>she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons,</b><br>Turtledoves and pigeons were common and inexpensive birds in ancient Israel, making them a practical alternative for those of lesser means. This provision ensured that everyone could participate in the sacrificial system. The use of birds for sacrifices is also seen in <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9</a>, where God instructs Abram to bring birds as part of a covenant ritual. The birds symbolize purity and innocence, fitting for offerings to God.<p><b>one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering.</b><br>The burnt offering signifies complete dedication to God, as the entire animal is consumed by fire (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). The sin offering, on the other hand, is for atonement and purification from sin (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20</a>). Together, these offerings represent both the worshiper's devotion and the need for reconciliation with God. This dual offering foreshadows the comprehensive atonement provided by Jesus Christ, who fulfills both roles as the ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<p><b>Then the priest will make atonement for her,</b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between the individual and God, performing the ritual to restore the woman's ceremonial purity. This role of the priest as an intercessor is a precursor to the high priestly ministry of Jesus, who intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The concept of atonement is central to the sacrificial system, pointing to the ultimate atonement made by Christ on the cross.<p><b>and she will be clean.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Being declared clean allowed the woman to re-enter the community and participate fully in religious life. This cleansing is not just physical but also spiritual, symbolizing restoration and acceptance by God. The theme of cleansing is prevalent throughout Scripture, culminating in the cleansing from sin offered through Jesus' sacrifice (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). This purification process underscores the holiness required to approach God, a standard ultimately met in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.

He provides an affordable sacrifice, assigns clear purposes to each offering, appoints a priest to mediate, and guarantees cleansing. The verse ultimately points ahead to Jesus, the perfect and final sacrifice and High Priest, through whom every believer&#8212;whatever his or her station&#8212;finds complete atonement and welcome before God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And if she be not able.</span>--As a merciful provision for those who were too poor to bring a lamb, the law permits them to bring a turtle-dove or a pigeon for a burnt offering, provided only it is the same kind of bird as the one brought for a sin offering; that is, they must either be both turtle-doves or both pigeons, and not one turtle-dove and one pigeon. Turtle-doves and pigeons were plentiful and cheap in Palestine (see <a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm" title="And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.">Leviticus 1:14</a>). It was therefore the poor woman's sacrifice which the mother of our Lord offered, when, in accordance with this commutation, she offered a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons, on presenting herself for purification at the Temple with the child Jesus, on the expiration of the prescribed term of uncleanness (<a href="/luke/2-24.htm" title="And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.">Luke 2:24</a>), and the priest, after sprinkling her with the blood of the humble sacrifice, declared her cleansed.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If she be not able to bring a lamb.</span> A concession is made to poverty, which in later times appears to have been largely acted on.
