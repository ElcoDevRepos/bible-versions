In ancient Israelite culture, this gesture signified the transfer of the individual's sins onto the animal, representing a substitutionary atonement. The laying on of hands is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the ordination of priests (<a href="/numbers/8-10.htm">Numbers 8:10</a>) and the commissioning of leaders (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>). It signifies a personal connection and responsibility, emphasizing the offerer's active role in the sacrificial process.<p><b>so it can be accepted on his behalf</b><br>The acceptance of the offering on behalf of the individual highlights the concept of substitutionary atonement, where the animal takes the place of the sinner. This principle is foundational in the sacrificial system and foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was accepted by God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The acceptance also indicates God's willingness to forgive and restore the relationship between Himself and the offerer.<p><b>to make atonement for him</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the covering or removal of sin. In the Old Testament, atonement was a central theme, with the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) being the most significant observance (Leviticus 16). The Hebrew word for atonement, "kaphar," means to cover, cleanse, or appease. This sacrificial system points to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection provide the final and complete atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). The concept of atonement underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of a mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the burnt offering, representing the sinner seeking atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burnt_offering.htm">The Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial animal, typically a bull, sheep, or goat, offered entirely to God as a symbol of complete surrender and atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The place where the burnt offering is presented and sacrificed, symbolizing the meeting point between God and man.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator who performs the sacrificial rites, representing the role of intercession between God and the offerer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where the offerings are made, representing God's dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The laying of hands on the burnt offering signifies the transfer of sin and the need for atonement.

The offerer indicated thereby both the surrender of his ownership of the victim, and the transfer to it of' the feelings by which he was influenced in performing this act of dedication to the Lord. From the practice which obtained during the second Temple, we know that the offerer himself laid both his hands between the two horns of the animal whilst alive, and that no proxy could do it. If several offered one sacrifice, each one laid his hand separately on the victim, confessing his sins and saying, "I have sinned, I have committed iniquity, I have transgressed and I have done this and this, but I repent before Thee, and this is my atonement." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering.</span> This putting, or forcibly leaning, the hand on the victim's head, which is the most essential part of the oblation of the victim, was a symbolical act implying "This animal is now for present purposes myself, and its life is my life."

The aspect under which atonement is presented here and elsewhere in the Old Testament is that of covering. But it is not the sin that is covered, but the sinner. Owing to his sin, the latter is exposed to the wrath of a just God, but something intervenes whereby he is covered, and he ceases, therefore, to attract the Divine anger and punishment. No longer being an object of wrath, he becomes at once an object of benevolence and mercy. The covering provided by a sacrifice is the blood or life of an animal, symbolically representing the offerer's own life freely surrendered by him <span class="accented">for his acceptance</span>, and typically foreshadowing the blood of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He is to lay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;s&#257;&#183;ma&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
