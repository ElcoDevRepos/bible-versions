The priest's use of oil signifies the setting apart of the individual for God's purposes. The oil remaining in the priest's palm after the initial anointing of the ear, thumb, and toe (<a href="/leviticus/14-17.htm">Leviticus 14:17-18</a>) indicates a surplus of God's provision and blessing.<p><b>the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed</b><br>The anointing of the head represents the complete purification and restoration of the individual. In biblical times, the head was often seen as the seat of one's identity and authority. This act symbolizes the person's full reintegration into the community and their restored relationship with God. It also prefigures the anointing of believers with the Holy Spirit in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>to make atonement for him</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, often through a sacrificial act. In the context of Leviticus, atonement is achieved through the shedding of blood and the application of oil, signifying both cleansing and consecration. This foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice on the cross reconciles believers to God (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the presence and authority of God in the ritual. The entire process of cleansing and atonement is conducted in the sight of God, underscoring His holiness and the seriousness of sin. It also highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God dwells among His people and requires them to be holy as He is holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the cleansing rituals and making atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_to_be_cleansed.htm">The One to be Cleansed</a></b><br>An individual who has been healed from a skin disease, such as leprosy, and is undergoing the purification process.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides the means for atonement and restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the rituals and sacrifices were performed, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oil.htm">The Oil</a></b><br>Used in the ritual as a symbol of consecration and the Holy Spirit's work in sanctification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_oil.htm">Symbolism of Oil</a></b><br>Oil in the Bible often symbolizes the Holy Spirit.

What remained &#8220;in his palm&#8221; is now highlighted.<p>&#8226; Oil is repeatedly linked with consecration and blessing. When Aaron and his sons were ordained, Moses &#8220;poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron&#8217;s head and anointed him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>). David later received a similar anointing, and &#8220;the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording underscores God&#8217;s thorough provision: nothing is wasted, and every drop serves a purpose in setting the cleansed person apart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed</b><p>&#8226; The head represents the whole person&#8212;thoughts, identity, authority.
