The kidneys were often associated with the seat of emotion and moral discernment in ancient Hebrew thought, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>. The fat, considered the best part of the animal, was reserved for God, signifying the offering of the best of oneself to the Lord. This practice underscores the importance of offering God the best and most intimate parts of one's life.<p><b>and the lobe of the liver</b><br>The liver, particularly its lobe, was another significant part of the sacrificial animal. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the liver was often used in divination practices, but in the Israelite sacrificial system, it was dedicated to God, indicating a rejection of pagan practices and a commitment to Yahweh. The removal of the liver's lobe for sacrifice symbolizes the surrender of one's will and decision-making to God, aligning with the biblical theme of submission to divine authority.<p><b>which he is to remove with the kidneys&#8212;</b><br>The priest's role in removing these specific parts highlights the meticulous nature of the sacrificial process, emphasizing the need for precision and care in worship. This act of removal signifies the separation of the sacred from the common, a recurring theme in Leviticus. The priest's actions foreshadow the work of Christ, our High Priest, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity, offering Himself as the ultimate sacrifice. This meticulous process also points to the need for purity and holiness in approaching God, as seen throughout the Levitical laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The priests who were responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals as outlined in Leviticus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given these laws to maintain holiness and atonement for sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the sacrifices were offered, representing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice described in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>, intended for atonement of unintentional sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sacrificial_system.htm">Understanding the Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for sacrifices in Leviticus highlight the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.

The kidneys were viewed as vital organs hidden deep within the body, symbolizing the innermost thoughts and motives (<a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). Because sin corrupts from the inside out, God required these hidden parts to be offered, underscoring that forgiveness reaches even the secret places (<a href="/leviticus/7-4.htm">Leviticus 7:4</a>).<p>- By specifying &#8220;both,&#8221; the text shows that nothing was to be left behind. A partial surrender is not sufficient when dealing with sin; every part must be placed before the Lord (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With the fat on them</b><p>- &#8220;All the fat is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). Fat represented the best and richest portion, devoted wholly to God. By attaching the fat to the kidneys, the Lord claimed both the hidden seat of desire and the choicest part of the animal.<p>- Sacrificing the fat demonstrated that the worshiper held nothing back. This principle echoes in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>, where believers are told to &#8220;honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your harvest.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Near the loins</b><p>- The phrase pinpoints location, ensuring the priest removed the precise portion God required (<a href="/exodus/29-13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a>). Accuracy mattered: God detailed where, what, and how, showing that He defines the terms of atonement.<p>- The loins also signify strength (<a href="/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>) and reproduction (<a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>). Removing fat near the loins acknowledged God&#8217;s ownership over both power and posterity, reminding Israel to rely on Him, not self, for strength and future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the lobe of the liver</b><p>- The liver&#8217;s lobe, like the kidneys, is an internal part. <a href="/exodus/29-13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a> and <a href="/leviticus/8-16.htm">Leviticus 8:16</a> repeat this requirement, emphasizing consistency in worship.<p>- In ancient Near Eastern culture, livers were associated with life and decision-making. By surrendering it, Israel confessed that life&#8217;s direction belongs to God alone (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>- The liver&#8217;s inclusion also balances the offering: neither emotion (kidneys) nor volition (liver) is excluded from God&#8217;s claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which he is to remove with the kidneys&#8212;</b><p>- The priest must &#8220;remove with the kidneys,&#8221; showing that obedience to God&#8217;s pattern is not optional (<a href="/leviticus/4-31.htm">Leviticus 4:31</a>). Precision signaled reverence.<p>- This removal prefigures the complete, once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, who &#8220;offered Himself&#8221; without defect (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>). Just as nothing was left in the animal, no sin remained uncovered by Jesus&#8217; atonement (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>- For believers today, thorough confession and wholehearted devotion mirror the thorough removal commanded here (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/4-9.htm">Leviticus 4:9</a> calls for the priest to remove the kidneys, their fat, the fat near the loins, and the liver&#8217;s lobe, underscoring that God wants every hidden, valuable, and life-directing part wholly surrendered.
