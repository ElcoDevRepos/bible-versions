In the context of <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10</a>, Moses is dealing with the aftermath of the deaths of Nadab and Abihu, who offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. The explanation he hears comes from Aaron, who is justifying why he and his remaining sons did not eat the sin offering. This moment highlights Moses' role as a listener and judge, emphasizing the importance of understanding and applying God's law correctly. It also reflects the tension between strict adherence to ritual and the compassionate understanding of human circumstances.<p><b>he was satisfied</b><br>Moses' satisfaction indicates his acceptance of Aaron's reasoning, which suggests that Aaron's explanation was in line with God's intentions, even if it deviated from the prescribed ritual. This moment underscores the flexibility within the law when it comes to matters of the heart and intention. It also points to the importance of discernment and wisdom in leadership. The satisfaction of Moses can be seen as a foreshadowing of the grace and understanding that Jesus Christ would later embody, fulfilling the law with compassion and mercy. Moses' acceptance here can be compared to instances in the New Testament where Jesus challenges the Pharisees' rigid interpretations of the law, emphasizing the spirit rather than the letter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness.

(See also <a href="/numbers/32-6.htm" title="And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?">Numbers 32:6</a>, &c.) Hence Jewish tradition from time immemorial ascribes the mistake to Moses, and not to Aaron. The paraphrase of this verse in the Palestine Chaldee Version, which embodies the ancient opinions, is very instructive. It is as follows: "And when Moses heard it, he approved of this explanation. Whereupon he sent a herald through the whole camp of Israel, saying, It is I from whom the law had been hid, and my brother Aaron brought it to my remembrance."<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/10-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard this [explanation],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he was satisfied.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;&#1463;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7789;a&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3190.htm">Strong's 3190: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be good, well, glad, or pleasing</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/leviticus/10-20.htm">Leviticus 10:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/leviticus/10-20.htm">OT Law: Leviticus 10:20 When Moses heard that it was pleasing (Le Lv Lev.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/leviticus/10-19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Leviticus 10:19"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 10:19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/leviticus/11-1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Leviticus 11:1"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 11:1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
