This offering underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for a mediator, represented by the priest, to intercede on behalf of the sinner. The priest's role as a mediator foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who is described in the New Testament as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness.</b><br>Atonement, or "kippur" in Hebrew, involves covering or purging sin, allowing the individual to be reconciled with God. The concept of uncleanness in Leviticus often relates to ceremonial impurity, which could result from various conditions, including skin diseases. This cleansing process highlights the holiness required to approach God and the need for purification. The act of atonement points to the ultimate atonement made by Christ, who cleanses believers from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<p><b>After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah," was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God. This offering was a voluntary act of worship, expressing devotion and commitment. The sequence of offerings&#8212;sin offering followed by burnt offering&#8212;illustrates the theological principle that reconciliation with God through atonement precedes true worship. The burnt offering prefigures Christ's complete sacrifice, as He offered Himself wholly to God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a central role in the purification process, acting as a mediator between the unclean person and God.
