The guilt offering, or "asham" in Hebrew, was required for certain unintentional sins or when restitution was needed. It highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement. The offering is brought to the LORD, indicating that sin is ultimately against God, even if it involves others. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, where David acknowledges that sin is primarily against God. The requirement to bring an offering underscores the personal responsibility of the sinner to seek reconciliation with God.<p><b>a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering:</b><br>The specification of a female lamb or goat indicates the accessibility of the offering, as these animals were more common and less costly than male animals. This provision shows God's grace in making atonement accessible to all, regardless of economic status. The use of a lamb or goat connects to the broader sacrificial system, where these animals often symbolize innocence and purity. This foreshadows Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The sin offering, or "chatat" in Hebrew, was meant to purify and cleanse the sinner, restoring their relationship with God.<p><b>And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin:</b><br>The role of the priest is crucial in the atonement process. The priest acts as a mediator between God and the sinner, performing the ritual that allows for the sinner's reconciliation with God. This prefigures the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-15</a>). The concept of atonement involves covering or removing sin, allowing the sinner to be in right standing with God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and forgiveness, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where the suffering servant makes atonement for the transgressions of many.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who prescribes the means of atonement for sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinner.htm">The Sinner</a></b><br>An individual who has committed a sin and is seeking atonement through the prescribed offering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator who performs the atonement ritual on behalf of the sinner.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guilt_offering.htm">The Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering required for atonement, specifically a female lamb or goat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the offering is brought and the atonement is made.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The concept of atonement in <a href="/leviticus/5-6.htm">Leviticus 5:6</a> underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for a mediator.

A &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; (sometimes called a trespass offering, see <a href="/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1&#8211;7</a>) was required when someone realized specific wrongdoing. As <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a> shows, owning our fault opens the door to mercy, and <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a> echoes the same principle today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the LORD</b><p>The sacrifice is &#8220;to the LORD,&#8221; reminding us that every sin is first an offense against God (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).

The first thing to be noticed is that the sacrifice is here called (<span class= "ital">?sh?m</span>) "trespass offering," which is the right rendering of the word, and is so translated in thirty-five out of the thirty-six passages in which it is used for a sacrifice. In the verse before us, and in the rest of this section, viz., <a href="/context/leviticus/5-7.htm" title="And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he has committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 5:7-13</a>, which treat of this sacrifice, no distinction is made between the ranks of the offenders. There is no special legislation for the high priest, the whole congregation, or the prince, as in the case with the (<span class= "ital">ch?t?th</span>) sin offering, which is described in the former chapter. The spiritual officer and temporal sovereign are here on a level with the ordinary layman. There is no scale in the sacrifices corresponding to the position of the sinner. They are all alike to bring the <span class= "ital">same </span>victim, either sheep or she goat. Though nothing is here said about the sacrificial rites which were to be performed in connection with the victim, in this case it is implied that, apart from the minor deviations here specified, they were to be the same as those in connection with the sin offering. The rule which obtained during the second Temple, is as follows: the trespass offerings were killed, and their blood sprinkled, as is before described in Numbers 4; they were then flayed, the fat and the inwards taken out and salted, and strewed on the fire upon the altar. The residue of this flesh was eaten by the priests in the court, like the sin offerings.<span class= "bld"><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and he must bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
