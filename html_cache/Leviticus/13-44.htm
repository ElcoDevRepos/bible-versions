This disease was not limited to what is known today as Hansen's disease but included a variety of skin conditions. The disease rendered a person ceremonially unclean, impacting their ability to participate in community and worship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin as a spiritual disease that separates humanity from God.<p><b>he is unclean.</b><br>Being declared "unclean" had significant social and religious implications. In ancient Israel, uncleanness was not merely a physical state but a spiritual one, affecting one's ability to engage in worship and community life. This concept underscores the holiness required by God and the separation sin causes between God and humanity. The state of uncleanness required purification rituals, symbolizing the need for spiritual cleansing.<p><b>The priest must pronounce him unclean</b><br>The role of the priest was crucial in diagnosing and declaring someone unclean. This responsibility highlights the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who is our ultimate High Priest. The priest's declaration was authoritative and necessary for maintaining the purity of the community. This process also points to the need for divine authority in matters of spiritual and moral discernment.<p><b>because of the infection on his head.</b><br>The specific mention of the infection on the head may indicate a particularly severe or visible form of the disease, emphasizing the thoroughness required in the examination. The head, often seen as a symbol of leadership and authority, being affected, could symbolize the pervasive nature of sin affecting all aspects of life. This detail also serves as a reminder of the comprehensive nature of God's law, addressing both physical and spiritual health.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_diseased_man.htm">The Diseased Man</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who has been examined and found to have a skin disease, specifically on his head, which renders him ceremonially unclean.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as the mediator and judge in matters of ceremonial cleanliness, responsible for examining individuals and declaring them clean or unclean.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_israel.htm">The Camp of Israel</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context involves the community of Israel, where maintaining ceremonial purity was crucial for communal worship and living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/ceremonial_law.htm">Ceremonial Law</a></b><br>This is part of the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, focusing on maintaining holiness and purity within the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncleanness.htm">Uncleanness</a></b><br>A state that required separation from the community and specific rituals for purification, highlighting the importance of holiness in the Israelite camp.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The requirement for the diseased man to be declared unclean underscores the importance of holiness and separation from sin.

Verse 44 singles out a confirmed case: &#8220;the man is diseased.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The focus is not on ordinary illness but on a visible, persistent skin disorder&#8212;commonly called leprosy in older translations&#8212;that God Himself labels as a serious defilement. See also <a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>, where Miriam&#8217;s sudden leprous condition halted Israel&#8217;s progress, and <a href="/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>, where Naaman&#8217;s greed-driven servant Gehazi received the same disease.<p>&#8226; The text teaches that disease is recognized by objective evidence, not personal opinion. In the same way Jesus identified genuine sickness before healing it (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is unclean</b><p>&#8226; The pronouncement &#8220;he is unclean&#8221; moves beyond physical diagnosis to spiritual status. Uncleanness barred people from corporate worship, communal life, and often family contact (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>).<p>&#8226; This reinforces the holiness of God, who requires separation from defilement (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). Physical uncleanness pictures the deeper problem of sin, which isolates the heart from God until cleansed (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By declaring someone unclean, the Law taught Israel&#8212;and still teaches us&#8212;how sin corrupts every sphere of life, underscoring our need for a Redeemer (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The priest must pronounce him unclean</b><p>&#8226; God assigns the priest, not the civil leader or the diseased man himself, to make the final call. This underscores ordained spiritual authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest acts as mediator, representing God to the people and the people to God (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). The process anticipates Christ, our great High Priest, who alone has the right to declare the sinner clean or unclean (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience to the priest&#8217;s verdict protected the congregation from contagion and preserved purity in worship (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>). It also provided a path for restoration once healing occurred (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of the infection on his head</b><p>&#8226; The infection&#8217;s location&#8212;&#8220;on his head&#8221;&#8212;makes the impurity unmistakable and impossible to hide. The head symbolizes identity and leadership (<a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>).<p>&#8226; A visible blemish in such a prominent place drives home the lesson that sin cannot be concealed (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Law required the affected person to cover his head and cry out &#8220;Unclean, unclean!&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>) so others could keep a safe distance. Though severe, these measures preserved the camp&#8217;s health and holiness, pointing forward to Christ who bore our uncleanness outside the camp (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-44.htm">Leviticus 13:44</a> literally identifies a physical disease, assigns a status of uncleanness, requires an authorized priestly verdict, and specifies the cause&#8212;an obvious infection on the head. Each step reveals God&#8217;s uncompromising holiness and humanity&#8217;s helplessness to cleanse itself. The passage foreshadows the gospel: only through the greater High Priest, Jesus Christ, can the unclean be fully healed and restored to fellowship with God and His people (<a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-42</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is diseased;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;r&#363;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6879.htm">Strong's 6879: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be struck with leprosy, to be leprous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is unclean.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2931.htm">Strong's 2931: </a> </span><span class="str2">Unclean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
