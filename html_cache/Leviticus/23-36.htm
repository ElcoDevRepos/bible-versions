The seven-day period reflects the completion and perfection often associated with the number seven in biblical texts. The food offerings, or sacrifices, were a way for the Israelites to express gratitude and dependence on God for provision. This practice is rooted in the agricultural context of ancient Israel, where harvest festivals were common. The offerings symbolize the people's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision, as seen in other feasts like Passover and Pentecost.<p><b>On the eighth day you are to hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the LORD.</b><br>The eighth day, known as Shemini Atzeret, marks a transition from the Feast of Tabernacles to a separate, yet connected, observance. The number eight often signifies new beginnings in the Bible, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus, which occurred on the first day of the week, the day after the Sabbath. This sacred assembly emphasizes communal worship and reflection, drawing the community together in unity before God. The continuation of food offerings underscores the ongoing relationship between God and His people, highlighting themes of renewal and dedication.<p><b>It is a solemn assembly;</b><br>The term "solemn assembly" indicates a gathering of serious and reverent nature. This assembly is not merely a social event but a time of spiritual significance, where the Israelites are called to focus on their covenant relationship with God. The solemnity of the occasion is a reminder of the holiness of God and the reverence due to Him. This concept is echoed in other biblical gatherings, such as the Day of Atonement, where the community comes together in repentance and worship.<p><b>you must not do any regular work.</b><br>The prohibition against regular work underscores the importance of setting aside time for worship and reflection. This command is consistent with the Sabbath principle, where rest is mandated to focus on spiritual matters. By refraining from work, the Israelites demonstrate trust in God's provision and prioritize their relationship with Him. This principle is seen throughout Scripture, where rest and worship are intertwined, pointing to the ultimate rest found in Christ, who invites believers to cease from their labors and find rest in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, including the instructions

34:21</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, every believer enters a greater rest (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9&#8211;11</a>) while still honoring rhythms of worship and repose (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> calls God&#8217;s people to a full week of continuous offerings, an eighth-day gathering that signals new beginnings, and a final day of restful, reverent focus. The pattern teaches sustained gratitude, communal worship, and trusting rest&#8212;realities now centered on Jesus, who fulfills and deepens the festival&#8217;s meaning while inviting us into lifelong, Spirit-empowered praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Seven days ye shall offer.</span>--The special sacrifices for this day consisted of a burnt offering of thirteen bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs, with an appropriate meat and drink offering, and a goat for a sin offering (<a href="/context/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12-38</a>). Whereupon were offered the peace offerings, the vows and the free-will offerings which constituted the repasts of the people. Whilst these sacrifices were being offered up the Levites chanted the festive Hallel, as on the feasts of Passover and Pentecost. This was repeated every day during the seven days of the festival, only that the number of animals offered as sacrifices diminished daily during the middle days of the festival, according to the prescription in <a href="/context/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12-38</a>. On the eve of the second day, or what is called the lesser festival, and on each of the five succeeding nights, was celebrated the "Rejoicing of the water-drawing<span class= "ital">" </span>in the court of the Temple. Four huge golden candelabra were lighted in the centre of the court, and the light emanating from them was visible to the whole city. Around these lights pious men danced before the people with lighted flambeaux in their hands, singing hymns and songs of praise, whilst the Levites, who were stationed on the fifteen steps which led into the women's court, and which corresponded to the fifteen psalms of degrees, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>steps (Psalms 120-134), accompanied the songs with instrumental music. It is supposed that on the last evening of the festival, when the splendid light of this grand illumination was to cease, Christ called attention to himself, "I am the light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>), which is to shine for ever, and illuminate not only the Temple and the holy city, but all the world.<p><span class= "bld">On the eighth day shall be an holy convocation.</span>--That is, like the first day, since no servile work is to be done on it. As it is not only the finishing of the feast of Tabernacles, but the conclusion of the whole cycle of festivals, the dwelling in tabernacles is to cease on it.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall offer.</span>--For this reason the sacrifices offered on this day are to be distinct, and unlike the sacrifices of the preceding days. The burnt sacrifice is to consist of one bullock, one ram, and seven lambs, with the appropriate meat and drink offerings, and one goat for a sin offering. (<a href="/context/numbers/29-36.htm" title="But you shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish:">Numbers 29:36-38</a>.) Being, however, attached to the feast of Tabernacles, the two festivals are often joined together, and spoken of as one festival of eight days.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/23-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are to present</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(taq&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7126.htm">Strong's 7126: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come near, approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an offering made by fire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_801.htm">Strong's 801: </a> </span><span class="str2">A burnt-offering, a sacrifice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
