The Law provided protections for them, recognizing their vulnerability (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>). The prosperity of a foreigner indicates the economic opportunities available in Israel, reflecting God's blessing on the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>). This prosperity could be seen as a test of Israel's faithfulness to God's commands regarding treatment of foreigners (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>).<p><b>but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute</b><br>The term "countryman" refers to a fellow Israelite. Economic hardship could result from various factors, including poor harvests, mismanagement, or unforeseen circumstances. The Law anticipated such situations, providing mechanisms for relief and restoration (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). This reflects the communal responsibility Israelites had towards one another, emphasizing compassion and support within the covenant community.<p><b>and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan</b><br>Selling oneself into servitude was a common practice in the ancient Near East as a means of debt repayment or survival. This provision in the Law allowed an Israelite to become a servant to a foreigner, highlighting the severity of his destitution. However, the Law also included regulations to ensure humane treatment and eventual release (<a href="/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48-55</a>). This situation underscores the importance of redemption and restoration, themes that resonate with the broader biblical narrative of deliverance and salvation, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner_or_temporary_resident.htm">Foreigner or Temporary Resident</a></b><br>This refers to non-Israelites living among the Israelites.

He may be redeemed by the value of his work down to the jubilee being paid by himself or his kinsman; he is to be set free when the jubilee comes at any rate; he is to be treated kindly while continuing in his master's service, and his countrymen are to see that no over-severity is used. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
