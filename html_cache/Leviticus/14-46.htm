The law was given to the Israelites during their wilderness journey, emphasizing the importance of purity and holiness in their community. The house represents a dwelling place that should be kept clean, symbolizing the need for spiritual cleanliness in one's life. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>, where believers are described as the temple of God, emphasizing the need for purity.<p><b>during any of the days that it is closed up</b><br>The closing up of the house indicates a period of observation and quarantine, reflecting the ancient practices of ensuring health and safety within the community. This period allowed for the determination of whether the contamination was spreading. It highlights the importance of patience and discernment in dealing with issues of impurity. This can be seen as a type of the waiting period for judgment, as seen in the parable of the wheat and the tares in <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>, where there is a time of waiting before the final separation.<p><b>will be unclean until evening</b><br>The concept of being unclean until evening is a recurring theme in Levitical law, signifying a temporary state of impurity that requires cleansing. This reflects the daily cycle of life and the opportunity for renewal and purification. The evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing a fresh start and the mercies of God being new every morning, as stated in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>. This temporary uncleanness can also be seen as a type of the temporary nature of sin's defilement, which is ultimately cleansed through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a crucial role in diagnosing and declaring a house unclean due to mold or mildew, as outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>. The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, ensuring that the laws of cleanliness are upheld.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/infected_house.htm">Infected House</a></b><br>The house in question is one that has been closed up due to a suspected case of mold or mildew, which is considered a form of uncleanness. This reflects the importance of purity and holiness in the community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_community.htm">Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context involves the Israelite community, who are called to live according to God's laws, maintaining both physical and spiritual cleanliness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncleanness.htm">Uncleanness</a></b><br>This concept is central to the passage, representing a state that separates individuals from the community and from God until purification is achieved.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time until which a person remains unclean, symbolizing a period of waiting and reflection before rejoining the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus remind us of the importance of holiness and being set apart for God. Just as the Israelites were called to maintain physical purity, we are called to maintain spiritual purity in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_mediator.htm">The Role of the Mediator</a></b><br>The priest's role in declaring a house unclean points to the need for a mediator between God and humanity. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills this role, offering us cleansing from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_sin_and_contamination.htm">Awareness of Sin and Contamination</a></b><br>Entering an unclean house results in temporary uncleanness, symbolizing how sin can contaminate our lives. We must be vigilant about what we allow into our lives and seek God's cleansing regularly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_community.htm">Restoration and Community</a></b><br>The process of becoming clean again emphasizes restoration and the importance of community. We are called to support one another in our spiritual journeys and help each other maintain purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/waiting_and_reflection.htm">Waiting and Reflection</a></b><br>The period of uncleanness until evening serves as a time for reflection and repentance.

Miriam&#8217;s seven-day quarantine (<a href="/numbers/12-15.htm">Numbers 12:15</a>) illustrates the same principle.<p>&#8226; Repeated days stress vigilance.

Literally, the statute protected Israel from physical and ritual contamination. Spiritually, it reminds believers that contact with what God calls defiling always affects us, that vigilance is required for as long as corruption remains present, and that cleansing&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;restores fellowship when the day is done.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">Moreover he that goeth into the house.</span>--If any one only momentarily entered the house whilst it was under quarantine, he contracted defilement, which lasted till sundown of the same day.
