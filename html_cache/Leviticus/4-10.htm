The fat, considered the richest part, was reserved for God alone, signifying His holiness and the need for purity in offerings. This practice is consistent with other offerings, such as the peace offering, where the fat was also removed and burned. The peace offering, or fellowship offering, was a voluntary act of worship, expressing thanksgiving and communion with God. The removal of fat in both offerings underscores the importance of giving God the choicest portions, reflecting a heart of reverence and submission.<p><b>Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering</b><br>The act of burning the fat on the altar signifies the complete dedication of the offering to God. The altar of burnt offering, located in the Tabernacle's outer court, was the place where sacrifices were made to atone for sin and restore fellowship with God. The burning of the fat produced a pleasing aroma, symbolizing the acceptance of the offering by God. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God, fulfilling the requirements of the law and providing a way for humanity to be reconciled to God. The priest's role in this process highlights the mediatory function between God and the people, a role perfectly fulfilled by Christ as our High Priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest is the mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals as prescribed by the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacred place where sacrifices were made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/ox_of_the_peace_offering.htm">Ox of the Peace Offering</a></b><br>An animal used in the peace offering, which was a voluntary sacrifice expressing gratitude and fellowship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fat.htm">Fat</a></b><br>Considered the best part of the animal, it was reserved for God, symbolizing giving the best to Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given the Law to follow, including the sacrificial system for atonement and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's role in the sacrificial system highlights the need for mediation between God and humanity, pointing to Jesus as our High Priest.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_the_altar.htm">Significance of the Altar</a></b><br>The altar represents a place of surrender and dedication.

In both cases, &#8220;all the fat&#8230;is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>), emphasizing that the choicest portions belong exclusively to Him.<p>&#8226; Removing the fat first sets apart what God claims for Himself before any further action. It pictures complete surrender of what is richest, mirroring <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> where believers present their bodies as &#8220;a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By repeating the exact steps used for a peace offering, the text highlights that reconciliation with God (peace) and cleansing from sin (sin offering) are inseparable; both depend on the same holy standard (<a href="/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The precision also guards the priest from innovation. God defines worship (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>); man does not. That principle still stands (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering</b><p>&#8226; The altar of burnt offering stood in the courtyard, constantly consuming sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>). Placing the fat there allowed its smoke to ascend as &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Burning signifies total dedication: nothing is reserved for human consumption (<a href="/leviticus/4-8.htm">Leviticus 4:8-10</a>). <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a> connects this complete offering to Christ, who &#8220;has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The priest mediates, illustrating the need for a go-between (<a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-47</a>). Today that role is fulfilled perfectly in Jesus, our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire also portrays judgment (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). When the fat is consumed, the sinner sees that God&#8217;s wrath falls on the substitute, not on the worshiper, prefiguring <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/4-10.htm">Leviticus 4:10</a> shows that the choicest portions of a sin offering are removed exactly as in a peace offering and then burned on the ever-burning altar. God claims the best, demands precise obedience, and provides a mediator to transfer judgment from sinner to substitute. The verse points ahead to Christ&#8217;s once-for-all sacrifice, where the richest and most perfect Offering was wholly given to secure both peace with God and cleansing from sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">just as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
