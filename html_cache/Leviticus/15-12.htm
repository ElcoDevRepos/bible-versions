The instruction to break a clay pot touched by a man with a discharge reflects the importance of maintaining ritual purity. Clay, being porous, could absorb impurities, making it impossible to cleanse thoroughly. This requirement underscores the seriousness of ritual impurity and the need for separation from anything that could defile the community. The breaking of the pot symbolizes the complete removal of impurity, aligning with the broader Levitical theme of holiness and separation from sin. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate cleansing and purification that Jesus Christ provides, as He is the one who purifies us from all unrighteousness (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>and any wooden utensil must be rinsed with water</b><br>Unlike clay, wood is non-porous and can be cleansed effectively with water. The act of rinsing signifies purification and restoration to a state of cleanliness. Water is a recurring symbol of purification in the Bible, representing the cleansing power of God&#8217;s Word and Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>). This practice reflects the broader biblical principle that while some impurities require complete destruction, others can be cleansed and restored. The use of water here prefigures the cleansing work of Christ, who offers living water that purifies and renews (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>, <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>).

This, however, is the only instance where an earthen vessel touched on the outside was defiled, thus again showing the intense loathing with which the guilt of this kind of infirmity was regarded.<p><span class= "bld">Every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.</span>--As these kinds of vessels were both more expensive and more difficult to restore, the Law, which so frequently takes into consideration the circumstances of the people, mercifully spares the more costly utensils. These are to undergo the same baptism as human beings. The administrators of the law during the second Temple took the expression "wood" in a more generic sense, as denoting more enduring material than clay; hence they included vessels made of copper, brass, silver, &c. With regard to the manner in which the vessels thus polluted are to be immersed, they ordained that if the utensil is dipped with its mouth downward, or if the vessel, at the time of its immersion, contains any liquor except water, the baptism is illegal. They, moreover, ordained that all new vessels which are purchased, or otherwise acquired, must likewise be immersed, for fear lest the maker, or some of those who have handled them prior to the purchase, might have been in a state of defilement. Hence the orthodox Jews to this day literally baptize cups, plates, knives, forks, or any new utensil which they buy. It is to this law that Christ refers when He says, "And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing [literally, <span class= "ital">the baptism</span>] of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables," or, as the Margin has it more correctly, "beds," or <span class= "ital">couches </span>(<a href="/mark/7-4.htm" title="And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables.">Mark 7:4</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/15-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Any clay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1435;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;re&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2789.htm">Strong's 2789: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earthenware, earthen vessel, sherd, potsherd</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
