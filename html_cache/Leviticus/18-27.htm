The biblical narrative often contrasts the Israelites with the Canaanites to highlight the call to holiness and separation from pagan practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>).<p><b>committed all these abominations</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to practices that are detestable to God, particularly those related to sexual immorality and idolatry. <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> outlines specific prohibitions against incest, adultery, child sacrifice, and other sexual sins. These practices were common among the Canaanites and are condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>). The use of the word "all" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of their sinfulness, which justified their expulsion from the land.<p><b>and the land has become defiled</b><br>The concept of land becoming defiled is significant in the Old Testament, where the land is seen as a gift from God that must be kept pure. The defilement of the land is a result of the inhabitants' sins, which pollute it and make it unfit for God's presence. This idea is echoed in <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>, where bloodshed defiles the land, and in <a href="/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, where idolatry is said to defile the land. The defilement necessitates divine judgment and cleansing, often through the removal of the sinful inhabitants, as seen in the conquest narratives of Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, receiving God's laws through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanites.htm">The Canaanites</a></b><br>The previous inhabitants of the Promised Land, known for their idolatrous and immoral practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, through whom God delivered the laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate lawgiver, establishing moral and ceremonial laws for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_abominations.htm">Understanding Abominations</a></b><br>Recognize that the term "abominations" (Hebrew: to'evah) refers to practices that are detestable to God, often linked to idolatry and sexual immorality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequence_of_sin.htm">The Consequence of Sin</a></b><br>The defilement of the land serves as a warning that sin has communal and environmental consequences, affecting more than just the individual.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy and separate from the practices of the world, emphasizing the importance of living according to His standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_patience.htm">God's Justice and Patience</a></b><br>The judgment on the Canaanites demonstrates God's justice, but also His patience, as He gave them time to repent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_to_modern_life.htm">Application to Modern Life</a></b><br>Believers today are called to examine their lives and communities for practices that may defile their spiritual environment and to seek purity and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_27_Land_defilement_impact.htm">How does Leviticus 18:27 emphasize the consequences of defiling the land?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_27_detestable_practices.htm">What practices are considered detestable according to Leviticus 18:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Lev_18_27_to_today_s_culture.htm">How can we apply Leviticus 18:27 to modern cultural practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Contrast_Lev_18_27_Rom_1_24-27_sins.htm">Compare Leviticus 18:27 with Romans 1:24-27 regarding sinful behaviors.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_27_s_role_in_today_s_holiness.htm">How does Leviticus 18:27 guide us in maintaining holiness today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Leviticus_18_27_s_bans.htm">What historical context influenced the prohibitions in Leviticus 18:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_27_and_ancient_Israel_s_culture.htm">How does Leviticus 18:27 reflect the cultural practices of ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_land_defilement_in_Lev_18_27.htm">Why does Leviticus 18:27 emphasize the defilement of the land?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_personal_convictions.htm">What defines an abomination?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_homosexuality_a_sin_in_the_bible.htm">Is homosexuality considered a sin in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what's_personalism's_core_principle.htm">Should the church accept practicing homosexuals as members?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_bisexuality_a_sin_in_the_bible.htm">Is bisexuality considered a sin in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Leviticus 18:27 Mean</div><b>For the men who were in the land before you</b><p>- The verse opens with a look backward. God reminds Israel that Canaan was not an empty canvas; it was already occupied by nations with established lifestyles (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- This framing teaches that God&#8217;s standards are not limited to Israel; He judges every nation by the same moral law (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>- It also underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over the land itself: He grants and removes occupancy according to righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Committed all these abominations</b><p>- &#8220;These&#8221; points to the specific sexual sins listed earlier in <a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6-23</a>, plus broader idolatry (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21, 24</a>).<p>- The catalog is not mere history; it shows the seriousness with which God views personal and societal purity (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>).<p>- By calling the practices &#8220;abominations,&#8221; God labels them as repugnant to His nature&#8212;a standard that does not shift with culture (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>- The warning is double-edged: Israel must not imitate the nations (<a href="/leviticus/20-22.htm">Leviticus 20:22-23</a>), and the church today must guard against cultural drift (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the land has become defiled</b><p>- Scripture presents land as more than geography; it is a moral witness that can be &#8220;defiled&#8221; by human sin (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>).<p>- Defilement produces consequences: &#8220;the land will vomit you out&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>). Judgment is not arbitrary; it flows from the accumulated weight of unchecked sin (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p>- The principle endures: national sin invites national consequences. Righteousness elevates a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p>- For believers, the defilement motif urges stewardship&#8212;keeping ourselves and our communities pure as temples of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-7</a>:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/18-27.htm">Leviticus 18:27</a> reminds us that God&#8217;s moral standards apply universally, that habitual sin is repulsive to Him, and that even the very ground is affected by human rebellion.
