This presentation signifies the beginning of their official service in the tabernacle. The act of presenting them highlights the importance of divine appointment and the need for a mediator between God and the people. Aaron and his sons represent the Levitical priesthood, which is a type of Christ, our ultimate High Priest, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>. The priesthood is established to maintain the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing the need for holiness and obedience.<p><b>and washed them with water.</b><br>The washing with water is a ceremonial act of purification, symbolizing the need for cleanliness and holiness before serving in the presence of God. This act foreshadows the New Testament concept of baptism, which signifies spiritual cleansing and rebirth (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, washing was a common ritual for priests before performing sacred duties, underscoring the importance of purity. This cleansing is a precursor to the sanctification process that believers undergo through Christ, who cleanses us from sin (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>). The use of water in this context also connects to the broader biblical theme of water as a symbol of life and purification, as seen in the waters of the Red Sea and the Jordan River.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai.
