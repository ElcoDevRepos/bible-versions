In the Old Testament, sin is often seen as a breach of covenant with God, reflecting a lack of faithfulness to His commands. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, where David acknowledges that his sin is primarily against God. The idea of unfaithfulness is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience is a sign of loyalty and love.<p><b>by deceiving his neighbor</b><br>Deception is a violation of the commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). In ancient Israel, community trust was vital, and deceit undermined social cohesion. The Hebrew word for deceive can also imply betrayal, which is a serious breach of trust. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God values truth and integrity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, which states that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.<p><b>in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him</b><br>This phrase refers to the practice of entrusting goods or money to another for safekeeping, a common practice in ancient societies. The Mosaic Law provided specific guidelines for handling such deposits (<a href="/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-13</a>), emphasizing the importance of honesty and accountability. The concept of stewardship is significant here, as it reflects the broader biblical principle that individuals are responsible for what is entrusted to them, whether by God or others.<p><b>or stolen</b><br>The mention of theft directly connects to the commandment "You shall not steal" (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). Theft is a direct violation of another's rights and property, disrupting the social order and trust within the community. The law in Leviticus seeks to address not only the act of theft but also the restoration and restitution required to mend the relationship between the offender, the victim, and God.<p><b>or if he extorts his neighbor</b><br>Extortion involves using power or threats to obtain something from someone, which is condemned throughout Scripture. This behavior is contrary to the biblical call to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and reflects a misuse of power and authority. The prophets frequently denounce extortion and oppression, as seen in <a href="/micah/2.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>, where those who covet and seize fields are condemned. This phrase underscores the importance of justice and righteousness in personal and communal relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is offended by sin and deceit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinner.htm">The Sinner</a></b><br>An individual who commits a sin by deceiving or wronging a neighbor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbor.htm">The Neighbor</a></b><br>The person who is deceived or wronged by the sinner.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deposit_or_security.htm">The Deposit or Security</a></b><br>Items or property entrusted to someone, which are central to the sin of deceit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/robbery_and_extortion.htm">Robbery and Extortion</a></b><br>Acts of taking or demanding something from someone wrongfully, highlighting the nature of the sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a personal failing but an offense against God.

Hence, when a man went on a journey, he concealed his precious things underground. This was connected with the danger of forgetting the spot where they were hidden, when search and digging had to be resorted to. This not only accounts for the fact that treasure is called in Hebrew by a name which denotes <span class= "ital">hidden, </span>or things which men are in the habit of hiding underground, but explains such allusions as "hidden riches of secret places" (<a href="/isaiah/45-3.htm" title="And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel.">Isaiah 45:3</a>), "and searchest for her as for hid treasure" (<a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm" title="If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;">Proverbs 2:4</a>), "dig for it more than for hid treasure" (<a href="/job/3-21.htm" title="Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;">Job 3:21</a>). To avoid this danger, men entrusted their treasure to the custody of a neighbour. It is to this practice which the text before us refers, and it is from this practice that the apostle took the expression when he declares, "I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day" (<a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12</a>; see also <a href="/leviticus/6-14.htm" title="And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.">Leviticus 6:14</a>, and <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse would be better translated as follows: - <span class="cmt_word">If a soul sin,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and commit a trespass against the Lord, and falsely deny to his neighbour something that was delivered to him to keep, or something that he had received in pawn, or something that he had taken away by violence, or hath got something by oppression from his neighbour.</span> Cf. the injunction in <a href="/leviticus/19-11.htm">Leviticus 19:11</a>: "Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another." <a href="/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-13</a> contains earlier legislation on the subject of things taken in trust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">someone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1434;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;p&#772;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><br /><span class="word">sins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1496;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;e&#183;&#7717;&#277;&#183;&#7789;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and acts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
