Aaron, as the first high priest, and his descendants were responsible for maintaining the sacrificial system, which was central to Israelite worship.<p><b>that this is the law of the burnt offering:</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, was a foundational sacrifice in the Levitical system. It symbolized atonement and complete dedication to God, as the entire animal was consumed by fire. This offering prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where He offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins.<p><b>The burnt offering is to remain on the hearth of the altar all night, until morning,</b><br>The requirement for the burnt offering to remain on the altar all night signifies the continual nature of atonement and dedication. It reflects the perpetual need for reconciliation with God. The night-long burning can be seen as a type of Christ's enduring sacrifice, which covers all sin for all time. The altar, located in the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice, emphasizing the importance of God's presence among His people.<p><b>and the fire must be kept burning on the altar.</b><br>The perpetual fire on the altar symbolizes God's eternal presence and the ongoing need for purification and atonement. This fire, which was originally kindled by God Himself, represents the divine acceptance of the sacrifices.
