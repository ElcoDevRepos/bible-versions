The priest acts as an inspector, ensuring the purity of the community. The removal of contaminated stones symbolizes the need to eliminate sin and impurity from one's life. This act of purification reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, where Paul speaks of removing the "old leaven" to be a new batch.<p><b>and thrown into an unclean place</b><br>The disposal of the stones in an unclean place signifies the separation of impurity from the community.

The unclean place represents the world outside of God's covenant community, a place where sin and impurity are cast away.<p><b>outside the city</b><br>The requirement to take the contaminated stones outside the city highlights the need to keep the community pure and free from defilement. This mirrors the practice of taking the scapegoat into the wilderness on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>), symbolizing the removal of sin from the people.

larger section (<a href="/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33-53</a>) where the LORD explains to Moses and Aaron how to deal with &#8220;defiling mold&#8221; in a house. Just as <a href="/bsb/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a> deals with skin disease in people, chapter 14 addresses impurity in dwellings. Earlier verses (vv. 34-38) describe the priest inspecting suspicious streaks on the walls; verse 40 tells what happens if the discoloration persists. By placing this instruction between personal purification (<a href="/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1-32</a>) and community worship (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>), the LORD shows that holiness must permeate private and public spaces alike (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The One Who Orders</b><p>&#8220;He must order&#8221; refers to the priest who represents God&#8217;s authority on earth (<a href="/leviticus/14-35.htm">Leviticus 14:35-38</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). The text underscores that cleansing is never a do-it-yourself project; divine oversight is required. Similarly, when Jesus sent lepers to the priest (<a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>), He honored this principle that only God&#8217;s appointed mediator can declare something clean.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Identifying the Contaminated Stones</b><p>&#8220;Contaminated stones&#8221; translate physical evidence of decay&#8212;plaster or masonry holding a fungus-like growth. The Bible treats this threat as real, not symbolic only; the Creator knows pathogens before microscopes did. By calling the stones &#8220;contaminated,&#8221; God labels whatever endangers life and holiness as unfit for His covenant people (cf. <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>). Sin likewise corrupts the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>), demanding decisive action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pulled Out&#8212;A Picture of Radical Removal</b><p>The instruction to &#8220;pull out&#8221; signals more than surface cleaning. The wall must be dismantled until every infected stone is removed. Jesus applies the same logic to spiritual life when He advises plucking out an eye that causes sin (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>). Partial measures leave hidden spores; thorough obedience guards the whole household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thrown into an Unclean Place Outside the City</b><p>Disposal &#8220;outside the city&#8221; prevents re-contamination. <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-4</a> tells Israel to send the ceremonially unclean outside the camp; the same pattern appears when Christ was crucified &#8220;outside the gate&#8221; bearing our uncleanness (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-13</a>). The principle is separation for the sake of restoration: what defiles must be isolated so what remains may be purified (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical Echoes for Believers Today</b><p>&#8226; Homeowners still confront mold, reminding us that fallen creation needs ongoing maintenance (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Parents and church leaders must guard their &#8220;spiritual houses&#8221; by removing influences that breed compromise (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Communities thrive when they act swiftly against what harms health or holiness, echoing these ancient but ever-relevant commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-40.htm">Leviticus 14:40</a> calls the priest to command that every infected stone be uprooted and disposed of outside the city. Literally, the verse protects Israel from physical disease; spiritually, it teaches uncompromising removal of corruption. God&#8217;s people, houses, and hearts are to remain pure, and anything that threatens that purity&#8212;whether mold on a wall or sin in a life&#8212;must be taken out, never left to spread.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[he]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
