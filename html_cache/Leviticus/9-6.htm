In the context of Leviticus, these commands pertain to the sacrificial system and priestly duties, which were essential for maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting the necessity of following God's will as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a> and <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>.<p><b>so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.&#8221;</b><br>The glory of the LORD refers to His manifest presence, often associated with the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and later the temple.
