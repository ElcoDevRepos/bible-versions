It signifies identification with the sacrifice, acknowledging the need for atonement. This practice is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern customs of transferring guilt or blessing through physical touch. It prefigures the laying of sins on Christ, the ultimate sin-bearer (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p><b>and slaughter it</b><br>The slaughtering of the goat represents the seriousness of sin and the necessity of bloodshed for atonement, as life is in the blood (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This foreshadows the sacrificial death of Jesus, who was crucified for the sins of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered</b><br>The location is significant, as it is the same place where burnt offerings, symbolizing complete dedication to God, are made. This indicates that the sin offering is also an act of worship and dedication. The centralization of sacrifice at the tabernacle underscores the importance of approaching God in the prescribed manner, pointing to Christ as the sole mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the act is done in the presence of God, highlighting His holiness and the need for purification to maintain fellowship with Him. It reflects the understanding that all sin is ultimately against God (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p><b>It is a sin offering.</b><br>The sin offering is distinct from other offerings, specifically addressing unintentional sins and providing a means for reconciliation with God. It underscores the gravity of sin and the provision of grace through sacrifice. This offering typifies Christ's atoning work, who became sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals, acting as a mediator between the people and God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_goat.htm">The Goat</a></b><br>The animal used for the sin offering, symbolizing the transfer of sin from the person to the sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The designated place for sacrifices, representing the presence of God and the place of atonement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who prescribes the sacrificial system for atonement and reconciliation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_offering.htm">The Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice intended to atone for unintentional sins and restore the relationship between the sinner and God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as an intermediary, highlighting the need for a mediator in our relationship with God.
