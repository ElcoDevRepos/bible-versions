Cedar wood is known for its durability and pleasant aroma, symbolizing incorruptibility and strength. Hyssop, a plant used for sprinkling in purification rites, represents cleansing and purification, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, "Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean." Scarlet yarn, a bright red thread, often symbolizes sin and redemption, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." The live bird represents life and freedom, contrasting with the slaughtered bird, and can be seen as a type of Christ, who was sacrificed yet lives.<p><b>dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and the fresh water</b><br>The combination of blood and water is a powerful symbol of cleansing and atonement. Blood represents life and is essential for atonement, as stated in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "For the life of a creature is in the blood." The fresh water signifies purification and renewal. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament when blood and water flowed from Jesus' side at the crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>), symbolizing the cleansing and life-giving power of His sacrifice.<p><b>and sprinkle the house seven times</b><br>The act of sprinkling seven times signifies completeness and perfection, as the number seven often represents in Scripture. This ritual purification of the house is a thorough cleansing, ensuring that it is entirely free from impurity. The use of seven is consistent with other biblical practices, such as the seven days of creation (Genesis 1) and the sevenfold Spirit of God (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). This complete purification can be seen as a foreshadowing of the perfect cleansing from sin offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest is the central figure in the purification process, acting as a mediator between God and the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cedar_wood.htm">Cedar Wood</a></b><br>A durable and aromatic wood, symbolizing strength and purification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hyssop.htm">Hyssop</a></b><br>A plant used for sprinkling in purification rites, symbolizing cleansing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/scarlet_yarn.htm">Scarlet Yarn</a></b><br>Represents the color of blood, symbolizing life and atonement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/live_bird.htm">Live Bird</a></b><br>Represents freedom and life, used in the ritual to symbolize the removal of impurity.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/s/slaughtered_bird.htm">Slaughtered Bird</a></b><br>Represents sacrifice and atonement, its blood used for purification.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>The physical structure being cleansed, symbolizing the dwelling place of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_cleansing.htm">Symbolism of Cleansing</a></b><br>The elements used in the ritual (cedar, hyssop, scarlet yarn, and birds) each carry deep symbolic meanings related to purification, strength, and life.
