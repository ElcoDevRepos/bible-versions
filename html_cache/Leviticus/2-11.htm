In the context of the grain offering, which was a voluntary act of worship and dedication to God, the absence of leaven signifies purity and holiness. This requirement underscores the need for offerings to be free from corruption, reflecting the holiness of God. The prohibition of leaven in offerings is also seen in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>), where unleavened bread symbolizes the haste of the Israelites' departure from Egypt and the purity required in their relationship with God.<p><b>for you are not to burn any leaven or honey as a food offering to the LORD</b><br>Honey, like leaven, can ferment and is thus associated with corruption. While honey is naturally sweet and often seen as a symbol of abundance and blessing (<a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>), its exclusion from offerings suggests that the worship of God should not rely on human sweetness or natural goodness, but on divine standards of holiness. The burning of offerings was a way to transform the physical into a spiritual act of worship, and anything that could corrupt this process was prohibited. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God desires sincerity and purity in worship (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and requires holiness from His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites and the mediator of God's laws, including the instructions for offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where offerings and sacrifices are made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>A type of offering made to the LORD, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving, which must be free of leaven and honey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_leaven_and_honey.htm">Symbolism of Leaven and Honey</a></b><br>Leaven often symbolizes sin and corruption in the Bible.
