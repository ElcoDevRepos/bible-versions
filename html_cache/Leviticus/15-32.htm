In the context of ancient Israel, maintaining ritual cleanliness was essential for participating in community worship and daily life. Discharges, whether due to illness or other natural bodily functions, rendered a person ceremonially unclean, necessitating specific purification rites. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>, which outlines various laws on cleanliness.<p><b>of the man who has an emission of semen</b><br>This part of the verse addresses a natural bodily function, emphasizing that even normal biological processes could result in temporary ritual impurity. The inclusion of semen emissions highlights the comprehensive nature of the purity laws, covering all aspects of life. This reflects the biblical understanding of human sexuality as a part of God's creation, yet also acknowledges the need for purity in approaching the divine. The New Testament, particularly in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, continues to address issues of sexual purity, though with a focus on moral rather than ritual cleanliness.<p><b>whereby he is unclean</b><br>The concept of being "unclean" in Levitical law is not synonymous with sinfulness but rather indicates a state of ritual impurity that requires purification. This distinction is crucial for understanding the purpose of these laws, which were designed to teach the Israelites about the holiness of God and the need for purity in His presence. The purification process often involved washing and waiting until evening, symbolizing a return to a state of readiness to engage in worship and community life. This theme of cleansing and restoration is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus' sacrifice is seen as the ultimate means of purification for believers, as noted in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the laws, who were to follow these instructions to maintain ritual purity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially important.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The mediators between God and the Israelites, responsible for teaching and enforcing these laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who established these purity laws to set His people apart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws in <a href="/leviticus/15-32.htm">Leviticus 15:32</a> emphasize the importance of ritual purity in the Old Testament, which served as a symbol of spiritual cleanliness and separation from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>These laws remind us of God's holiness and the need for His people to be distinct from the surrounding nations.

Earlier verses describe it in detail, noting that anything the afflicted man touches&#8212;bed, chair, even pottery&#8212;becomes unclean (<a href="/leviticus/15-3.htm">Leviticus 15:3&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s concern reaches beyond hygiene; He ties physical conditions to ceremonial purity so that His people constantly remember His holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44&#8211;45</a>).<p>&#8226; The repeated phrase &#8220;unclean until evening&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5, 7, 8</a>) shows mercy: there is a clear route back to fellowship once the proper washing and waiting are complete (<a href="/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By establishing a law for bodily discharges, the Lord protects the camp from defilement and keeps worship at the tabernacle pure (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the man who has an emission of semen</b><p>&#8226; Scripture distinguishes a normal, momentary emission from the chronic discharge just discussed. Verses 16&#8211;18 address the ordinary release of semen, calling for bathing and waiting until evening&#8212;simple, approachable steps.<p>&#8226; Sexual intimacy within marriage remains honored; the law does not label the act sinful. Instead, it underscores that even God-given pleasures occur in fallen bodies needing cleansing. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/23-10.htm">Deuteronomy 23:10&#8211;11</a>, where a nocturnal emission requires similar purification outside the camp.<p>&#8226; The required washing&#8212;&#8220;he shall bathe himself in water&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/15-16.htm">Leviticus 15:16</a>)&#8212;mirrors the broader biblical pattern: outward washing symbolizes the inward need for God&#8217;s cleansing (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; By mentioning semen explicitly, God trains His people to view every aspect of life, including sexuality, under His lordship (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). Nothing is secular or off-limits to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whereby he is unclean</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Unclean&#8221; in Leviticus signals ceremonial status, not necessarily moral guilt. A man with an emission has not committed a sin by default, but he cannot enter sacred spaces until cleansed (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Uncleanness serves as a living parable: physical conditions depict the spiritual separation sin causes. Isaiah echoes this theme&#8212;&#8220;your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The law&#8217;s temporary restrictions point forward to Christ, who touches the unclean and makes them whole (<a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-42</a>). His atoning blood accomplishes what repeated washings could only foreshadow (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus, <a href="/leviticus/15-32.htm">Leviticus 15:32</a> closes the section by summarizing both categories&#8212;chronic discharge and single emission&#8212;so Israel grasps the breadth of God&#8217;s holiness and the grace He provides for restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-32.htm">Leviticus 15:32</a> wraps up God&#8217;s instructions on bodily discharges, emphasizing that every physical condition falls under His holy oversight. Chronic discharges and single emissions alike render a man ceremonially unclean, not to shame him but to teach the nation about God&#8217;s purity and the need for cleansing. Simple, accessible steps&#8212;washing, waiting, occasionally offering sacrifices&#8212;open the door back to fellowship. The verse ultimately points us to Christ, whose perfect cleansing fulfills the law&#8217;s purpose and brings permanent access to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32, 33) <span class= "bld">This is the law.</span>--These two verses give a summary of the contents of the chapter.
