The priest's role as examiner underscores the importance of spiritual leadership in maintaining community purity. This reflects the priestly duty to discern and uphold the holiness of the congregation, akin to the New Testament role of church leaders in spiritual oversight (<a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>).<p><b>and if he sees that the infection is unchanged</b><br>The unchanged state of the infection suggests a need for careful observation and patience. This mirrors the biblical principle of discernment and waiting for clear evidence before making judgments, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>. The priest's careful examination reflects God's desire for thoroughness and justice in dealing with sin and impurity.<p><b>and has not spread on the skin</b><br>The spread of infection symbolizes the pervasive nature of sin, which, if unchecked, can corrupt the entire community (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). The skin, as the body's outermost layer, represents the visible manifestation of inner spiritual conditions. This highlights the need for vigilance in addressing sin before it affects others.<p><b>the priest must isolate him for another seven days</b><br>Isolation serves as a protective measure for the community, preventing the spread of physical and spiritual impurity. This practice foreshadows the concept of church discipline in the New Testament, where unrepentant sin is addressed to maintain the purity of the body of Christ (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>).

In the context of skin disease, the pause gives time for clarity&#8212;neither rushing to declare someone unclean nor assuming a quick cure. Joshua&#8217;s seven-day march around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15</a>) shows the same pattern: waiting in obedient trust for God&#8217;s decisive day.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priest is to reexamine him</b><p>The priest serves as God&#8217;s appointed mediator (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>), applying the Word to real life. Just as Jesus told the lepers, &#8220;Go, show yourselves to the priests&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>), this inspection keeps spiritual authority tied to covenant community health. Notice:<p>&#8226; No self-diagnosis&#8212;the person submits to God-given oversight.<p>&#8226; The priest looks again, proving that initial assessments can be revisited in light of fresh evidence (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if he sees that the infection is unchanged</b><p>Stagnation matters. An unhealed spot may signal deeper trouble, so the priest examines for genuine progress, not mere appearance. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reminds us that faith shows movement; here, physical improvement signals wholeness. If nothing changes, patience is still required; &#8220;The farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and has not spread on the skin</b><p>Containment is mercy. Sin, like infection, can spread when unchecked; Paul warns, &#8220;A little leaven leavens the whole batch&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>). By confirming the disease has stayed put, the priest guards the camp from wider defilement (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). God values both the individual and the community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priest must isolate him</b><p>Quarantine protects everyone while offering the sufferer a clear path to restoration. <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a> required the removal of the unclean &#8220;so they do not defile the camp.&#8221; Yet isolation is not rejection; it is loving discipline aimed at healing (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>). Modern believers see a parallel in church discipline that seeks repentance, not exclusion (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for another seven days</b><p>A second full cycle highlights God&#8217;s blend of caution and grace.

The verse teaches us to value patient discernment, community responsibility, and the hope of full restoration under God&#8217;s perfect law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And the priest shall look on him.</span>--If at the end of a week there is no alteration in the symptoms, the case must be adjourned for another seven days. The same priest who inspected it at the first must examine it again, as another one could not tell whether it has spread or not. If the priest died in the interim, or was taken ill, another priest could examine the patient, but could not pronounce him unclean.
