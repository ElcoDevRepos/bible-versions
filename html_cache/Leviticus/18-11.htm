The prohibition reflects the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel, where family structures were central to community life. The phrase "daughter of your father's wife" indicates a half-sister, highlighting the importance of respecting familial relationships and avoiding incestuous unions. This command is consistent with the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from the practices of surrounding nations, which often included incestuous relationships.<p><b>born to your father</b><br>The specification "born to your father" clarifies the familial relationship, emphasizing that even if the daughter is not from the same mother, she is still considered a sister. This highlights the patriarchal nature of ancient Israelite society, where lineage and inheritance were traced through the father. The emphasis on paternal lineage underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity of the family line, which was crucial for inheritance rights and social stability.<p><b>she is your sister</b><br>The declaration "she is your sister" serves as a reminder of the sacredness of the sibling relationship. In biblical times, the family unit was the foundation of society, and maintaining its sanctity was paramount. This command reinforces the idea that certain relationships are inviolable and must be respected to preserve the moral and social order. The prohibition against incest is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>, and is consistent with the New Testament's call to live in purity and holiness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</a>). The emphasis on family purity can also be seen as a type pointing to the purity and holiness of Christ, who is described as the bridegroom of the Church, His bride, in <a

Hence to avoid a senseless repetition of the same prohibition we must either regard this clause as having crept into the text from <span class= "bld">a </span>marginal gloss, or we must correct the first letter of the disjunctive particle in <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a>, which would make it "the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father and the daughter of thy mother." Accordingly, <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a> prohibits marriage with a full sister, whilst the verse before us forbids it with a half-sister.
