The use of "none of you" indicates that this is a universal mandate, applicable to all members of the Israelite community. This command is part of the Holiness Code, which outlines the standards of conduct for the Israelites, setting them apart from the surrounding nations. The directive to "approach" implies not just physical proximity but also the intention to engage in prohibited actions.<p><b>any close relative</b><br>The term "close relative" refers to family members within a certain degree of kinship. In the ancient Near Eastern context, family structures were often extended, and maintaining the sanctity of these relationships was crucial for social stability. This prohibition is part of a broader set of laws designed to protect the family unit and ensure that relationships remain pure and respectful. The concept of "close relative" is further defined in the surrounding verses, which list specific familial relationships that are off-limits for sexual relations.<p><b>to have sexual relations.</b><br>This phrase explicitly identifies the nature of the prohibited action. Sexual relations within the family were seen as a violation of the natural order established by God. Such actions were not only socially disruptive but also spiritually defiling. The prohibition of incestuous relationships is consistent with similar laws found in other ancient cultures, though the biblical laws are often more comprehensive. This command underscores the importance of sexual purity and the need to honor God's design for human relationships.<p><b>I am the LORD.</b><br>This declaration serves as the divine authority behind the command. The phrase "I am the LORD" is a frequent refrain in Leviticus, reminding the Israelites of God's sovereignty and holiness. It reinforces the idea that these laws are not arbitrary but are rooted in the character and will of God. The use of God's covenant name, "LORD" (YHWH), emphasizes the special relationship between God and His people, calling them to reflect His holiness in their conduct. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the call for His people to be holy as He is holy, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, who were being prepared to live as God's holy people in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the laws to Moses, including the laws in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ceremonial laws for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people with practices contrary to God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_relationships.htm">Holiness in Relationships</a></b><br>God calls His people to maintain purity in their relationships, reflecting His holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_boundaries.htm">Respect for Family Boundaries</a></b><br>The command underscores the importance of respecting family boundaries and the sanctity of familial relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_distinction.htm">Cultural Distinction</a></b><br>The Israelites were to be distinct from the surrounding nations, whose practices were often contrary to God's laws.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_authority.htm">God's Authority</a></b><br>The phrase "I am the LORD" emphasizes God's authority and the divine origin of these commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contemporary_relevance.htm">Contemporary Relevance</a></b><br>The principles of sexual purity and respect for family boundaries remain relevant for Christians today, calling for a counter-cultural stance in a permissive society.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_6_s_role_in_family_purity.htm">How does Leviticus 18:6 guide us in maintaining family purity today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ignoring_Leviticus_18_6_consequences.htm">What are the consequences of ignoring the command in Leviticus 18:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Leviticus_18_6_to_honoring_family.htm">How does Leviticus 18:6 connect to the Ten Commandments on honoring family?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_uphold_Leviticus_18_6_boundaries.htm">Why is it important to uphold the boundaries set in Leviticus 18:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Teach_Leviticus_18_6_to_youth.htm">How can we teach the principles of Leviticus 18:6 to younger generations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_6_on_family_ties.htm">What does Leviticus 18:6 reveal about God's view on family relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_6_s_impact_on_Christian_morals.htm">How does Leviticus 18:6 influence modern Christian views on morality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Leviticus_18_6_in_law.htm">Why is Leviticus 18:6 significant in the context of biblical law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'uncover_nakedness'_mean.htm">What does "uncover the nakedness" mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_no_divine_judgment_on_amnon.htm">Why is there no direct divine judgment against Amnon for his actions in 2 Samuel 13:1&#8211;14? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_new_anointing.htm">What does 'uncover the nakedness' mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_incest.htm">What does the Bible say about incest?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Leviticus 18:6 Mean</div><b>None of you</b><p>This opening phrase sweeps every Israelite into the command.

The Lord&#8217;s standards are not reserved for leaders or priests alone; they apply to each heart and household. <a href="/numbers/15-29.htm">Numbers 15:29-30</a> echoes the same inclusiveness in matters of obedience, whether sins are unintentional or defiantly willful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are to approach</b><p>&#8220;Approach&#8221; pictures the first step toward wrongdoing&#8212;moving closer both physically and in intent.

Paul urges believers to take the same posture: &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>) and &#8220;Make no provision for the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>).

Similar safeguards reappear in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20-23</a>, where curses are pronounced on those who violate family sanctity. When Corinth tolerated a man living with his father&#8217;s wife, Paul cried, &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you have been filled with grief and removed from your fellowship the man who did this?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>).

His name&#8212;YHWH&#8212;underscores covenant authority and relational faithfulness. Over forty times in Leviticus the Lord seals directives with this signature (e.g., 11:44-45; 19:37). Because He is holy, His people must mirror that holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).

Respecting these limits honors family, guards purity, and reflects the character of the Lord who calls His people to be set apart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">None of you shall approach.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">man, man, ye shall not approach. </span>It is part of the phrase used in <a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm" title="What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it out of the camp,">Leviticus 17:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm" title="And you shall say to them, Whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-13.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunts and catches any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.">Leviticus 17:13</a>, and should accordingly be rendered by <span class= "ital">no man whatsoever shall approach. </span>The absence of the words "of the house of Israel," which, in the other instances, form part of this phrase, as we are assured by the authorities in the time of Christ, shows that these prohibitions are also binding upon the stranger who took up his abode among the Israelites, lest the land be defiled by his transgressions. Though primarily addressed to man, who, in these cases, takes the initiative, the punishment for violating any of these laws was visited upon both man and woman.<p><span class= "bld">Near of kin to him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the flesh of his flesh. </span>(See <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm" title="My flesh and my heart fails: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.">Psalm 73:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-20.htm" title="Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?">Psalm 78:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-27.htm" title="He rained flesh also on them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:">Psalm 78:27</a>; <a href="/context/micah/3-2.htm" title="Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;">Micah 3:2-3</a>.) The combination of two synonymous expressions is often used to denote intensity. Thus the phrase rendered "my exceeding joy" in the Authorised Version (<a href="/psalms/43-4.htm" title="Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy: yes, on the harp will I praise you, O God my God.">Psalm 43:4</a>), literally means <span class= "ital">the joy of my joy, </span>or, as the Margin has it, "the gladness of my joy." Accordingly, "the flesh of his flesh" signified "nearness of his flesh," his near kin. This technical sense is assigned to the first of these two words by itself in <a href="/context/leviticus/18-12.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister: she is your father's near kinswoman.">Leviticus 18:12-13</a>, &c, where it is translated "near kinswoman." It expresses kinship of both consanguinity and mere affinity. (See <a href="/leviticus/18-17.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shall you take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.">Leviticus 18:17</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The next thirteen verses contain the law of incest, or the prohibited degrees of marriage. The positive law of marriage, as implanted in the human heart, would be simply that any man of full age might marry any woman of full age, provided that both parties were willing. But this liberty is at once controlled by a number of restrictions, the main purpose of which is to prevent incest, which, however much one nation may come to be indifferent to one form of it, and another to another, is yet abhorrent to the feelings and principles of mankind. The Hebrew restrictive law is contained in one verse. <span class="cmt_word">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord.</span> All that follows (verses 9-18) is simply an amplification and an explanation of the words, <span class="accented">near of kin to him.</span> These words would be literally rendered, <span class="accented">flesh of his flesh</span>, or less probably (as in the margin), <span class="accented">remainder of his flesh.</span> They certainly include within the compass of their meaning those that are near by affinity, as much as those that are near by consanguinity. This is proved by the instances given below, where no difference is drawn between blood relations and relations by marriage, the latter being supposed to become the former, in consequence of the marriage that has taken place. Nearness of kin is generally counted by "degrees;" but, unfortunately, this word is itself ambiguous, for it is used in different senses by canonists and by civilians. So far as the direct line is concerned, the same method of calculation is observed by the canon and by the civil law. There is one degree from the son to the mother, two degrees to the grandmother; one degree from the father to the daughter, two degrees to the granddaughter. But this is not so with the collateral lines. A brother and sister, for example, are regarded by the canon law as in the first degree of kinship, because there is only one step to the father, in whom their blood meets; but the civil lawyers consider them as being in the second degree, because, as they calculate, there is one step from the brother to the father, and a second from the father to the sister. An aunt is, according to the canonists, in the second degree of propinquity, because there are two steps from her nephew to his grandfather, who is likewise her father, in whom their blood unites; but, according to the civilian's calculation, there are three steps, namely, from her nephew to his grandfather, two steps, and a third from that grandfather to his daughter the aunt; and therefore the aunt and nephew are in the third degree of propinquity. The case of an uncle and niece is exactly the same as that of a nephew and aunt. On the same principle, according to the canonists, first cousins are in the second degree of kinship; according to the civilians, in the fourth. Propinquity by affinity is calculated in just the same way; so that the brother's wife is in the same degree of relationship as the brother, and wife's sister as the sister by blood. In the code before us, confirmed by that in Deuteronomy, marriage is forbidden with the following blood relations: mother (verse 7), daughter (verse 17), sister (verse 9; <a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>), granddaughter (verse 10), aunt (verses 12, 13; <a href="/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a>); and with the following relations by affinity: mother-in-law (verse 17; chapter Leviticus 20:14; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-23.htm">Deuteronomy 27:23</a>), daughter-in-law (verse 15; <a href="/leviticus/20-12.htm">Leviticus 20:12</a>), brother's wife (verse 16; <a href="/leviticus/20-21.htm">Leviticus 20:21</a>), stepmother (verse 8; chapter 20:11; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>; see <a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>), stepdaughter and step-granddaughter (verse 17), uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage (verse 14; <a href="/leviticus/20-20.htm">Leviticus 20:20</a>); putting aside for the present the question of who is meant by <span class="accented">a wife to her sister</span>, in verse 18. In these lists, according to the canonists' method of reckoning, the mother, the daughter, and the sister are related in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, the brother's wife, are related in the first degree of affinity. The granddaughter and the aunt are in the second degree of consanguinity; the wife's granddaughter and the uncle's wife in the second degree of affinity. According to the civilians' reckoning, the following would be the degrees of propinquity: - The mother and the daughter would be in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, would be in the first degree of affinity. The sister and the granddaughter would be in the second degree of consanguinity; the brother's wife and the wife's granddaughter would be in the second degree of affinity. The aunt by blood would be in the third degree of consanguinity, and the uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage, would be in the third degree of affinity. The wife's sister, with regard to whom it is questioned whether she is referred to or not in verse 18, is in the first degree of affinity (a man's wife being regarded as himself) according to the canonists' reckoning, and in the second according to the civilians'. There is no mention made in the code of the grandmother, the niece, and the cousin-german. All of these are in the second degree of consanguinity according to the canon law; and according to the civil law, the grandmother would be in the second degree, the niece in the third, and the cousin-german in the fourth. It may reasonably be supposed that by the expression, <span class="accented">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness</span>, intercourse is forbidden between all those who are related by consanguinity or affinity in the first and second degrees according to the canonists' reckoning (except cousins-german, whose case is considered below); in the first, second, and third degrees 'according to the civilians' method of calculating; whether they are mentioned by name in the list or not. It is only by implication, not by direct injunction, that marriage even with a daughter is forbidden (verse 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">None of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are to approach</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;iq&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7126.htm">Strong's 7126: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come near, approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">close relative</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7607.htm">Strong's 7607: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flesh, as living, for, food, food of any kind, kindred by blood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to have sexual relations.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7713;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
