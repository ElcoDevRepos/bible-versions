The fine flour and olive oil represent the best of the produce, symbolizing purity and dedication. In ancient Israel, these ingredients were staples, signifying sustenance and blessing. The priest's action of removing a handful signifies a portion set apart for God, reflecting the principle of offering the first and best to the Lord.<p><b>together with all the frankincense from the grain offering</b><br>Frankincense, a costly and fragrant resin, was used in worship to symbolize prayer and devotion rising to God. Its inclusion in the grain offering underscores the importance of worship being a fragrant offering to the Lord. Frankincense was also used in the tabernacle and later the temple, connecting this offering to the broader context of Israelite worship. The use of frankincense can be seen as a type of Christ, whose life and sacrifice were a pleasing aroma to God.<p><b>and burn the memorial portion on the altar</b><br>The act of burning the memorial portion signifies the offering being wholly dedicated to God. The altar, central to Israelite worship, was where sacrifices were made, symbolizing atonement and reconciliation with God. The term "memorial portion" indicates that this act serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people. It points to the need for continual remembrance of God's provision and faithfulness.<p><b>as a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>This phrase reflects the idea that sacrifices, when offered with a sincere heart, are pleasing to God. The concept of a "pleasing aroma" is found throughout the Old Testament, indicating God's acceptance of the offering. It foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose offering of Himself was the ultimate pleasing aroma to God, fulfilling the sacrificial system and establishing a new covenant.
