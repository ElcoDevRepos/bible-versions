This law is part of the Holiness Code, which emphasizes purity and separation from anything that defiles. The bed, as a place of rest, becomes unclean by association, highlighting the pervasive nature of impurity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where even indirect contact with impurity necessitates cleansing. The concept of uncleanness here is not about hygiene but about ritual purity, which was crucial for maintaining a right relationship with God. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes internal purity over external rituals (<a href="/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>).<p><b>and any furniture on which he sits will be unclean</b><br>The inclusion of furniture extends the principle of transferred impurity beyond the bed, indicating that anything the man with the discharge comes into contact with is affected. This underscores the comprehensive nature of the laws concerning purity and the need for vigilance in maintaining holiness. In ancient Israel, these laws served to protect the community from spiritual defilement and to teach the Israelites about the pervasive nature of sin. The idea of transferred impurity can be seen as a type pointing to the need for a savior who can cleanse from all unrighteousness. In the New Testament, Jesus is portrayed as the one who touches the unclean and makes them clean, reversing the flow of impurity (<a href="/matthew/8.htm">Matthew 8:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the laws of purity and cleanliness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The mediators between God and the Israelites, responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncleanliness.htm">Uncleanliness</a></b><br>A state that required purification rituals to restore ceremonial cleanliness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws in <a href="/leviticus/15-4.htm">Leviticus 15:4</a> emphasize the importance of ritual purity in maintaining a relationship with God.

God singles it out because rest is where we let down our guard. When impurity touches even that place, it matters (see <a href="/leviticus/15-21.htm">Leviticus 15:21</a>; <a href="/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a> for beds linked to human frailty).<p>- The verse reminds us that holiness is not restricted to &#8220;religious&#8221; zones. Every corner of life, even the nighttime routine, lies under God&#8217;s watchful eye (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On which the man with the discharge lies</b><p>- The &#8220;man with the discharge&#8221; is described earlier in verses 2&#8211;3. His condition is chronic, not just a brief spill of blood. It&#8217;s a picture of something ongoing and uncontrolled.<p>- Anyone sharing that bed can&#8217;t shrug off the impurity; contact spreads it (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>- The passage refuses to ignore bodily realities. God dignifies the physical by regulating it, showing that spirituality and biology are not enemies (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be unclean</b><p>- &#8220;Unclean&#8221; means ceremonially defiled, barred from worship until cleansing (<a href="/leviticus/11-31.htm">Leviticus 11:31</a>; 13:46). It is not moral guilt per se but a vivid reminder that defect blocks access to a holy God (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>).<p>- The need to label the bed as unclean forces people to decide: obey God&#8217;s safeguards or treat impurity lightly. Obedience preserves life and fellowship (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And any furniture</b><p>- The term covers items beyond the bedroom&#8212;chairs, cushions, saddles (<a href="/leviticus/15-6.htm">Leviticus 15:6</a>). God widens the circle, stressing that impurity radiates outward.<p>- The lesson: sin and sickness never stay contained; they infiltrate the ordinary (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole lump&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On which he sits</b><p>- Sitting suggests routine activities&#8212;eating, talking, working. Nothing is neutral if the source is impure (<a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>- The community learns vigilance: recognizing where the man sat helps others avoid secondary contamination until cleansing is complete (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> cautions gentleness yet watchfulness with those caught in transgression).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be unclean</b><p>- Again, the identical verdict underscores certainty. This is not a maybe. Contact inevitably transmits uncleanness (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>).<p>- Yet the law also provides hope: washing, waiting, and sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13&#8211;15</a>). These preparations foreshadow the deeper cleansing Christ supplies once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-4.htm">Leviticus 15:4</a> teaches that impurity is contagious and comprehensive&#8212;it follows a sick man from bed to chair, from private rest to public life. God marks out these rules to shield His people and to spotlight the deeper truth that only divine cleansing restores full fellowship. The verse calls believers to honor God&#8217;s holiness in every sphere, recognize the far-reaching effects of sin, and trust the greater provision of Christ, who alone can make the unclean clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Every bed, whereon he lieth.</span>--So severely did the canonical law deal with these cases that they interpreted the defilement communicated to the bed, and hence also to his seat and saddle, by the patient in five different ways: by standing, sitting, lying, hanging, or leaning on it. The patient's polluting power is so great that even if the bed, seat, or saddle is under a stone, he defiles it through the stone by any of these actions.
