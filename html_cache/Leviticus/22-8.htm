The prohibition against eating animals that died naturally or were killed by other animals is rooted in the concern for ritual purity. Such animals were considered unclean because they were not slaughtered according to the prescribed method, which involved draining the blood. Blood was seen as the life force and was to be treated with reverence (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This law underscores the importance of maintaining holiness and separation from impurity, a theme prevalent throughout Leviticus. The prohibition also reflects a broader cultural context where dietary laws distinguished the Israelites from surrounding nations, reinforcing their identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>which would make him unclean</b><br>The concept of uncleanness in Leviticus is both physical and spiritual, affecting one's ability to participate in religious activities. Eating unclean food would defile a person, making them unfit for worship and service in the tabernacle. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God is holy, and His people must also strive for holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The laws of cleanliness served as a constant reminder of the need for purity in approaching God. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills and transcends these laws, emphasizing inner purity over ritual observance (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>).<p><b>I am the LORD</b><br>This declaration serves as a divine signature, affirming the authority and sanctity of the command. It reminds the Israelites that their obedience to the law is not merely a cultural or social obligation but a covenantal duty to their God. The phrase "I am the LORD" appears frequently in Leviticus, reinforcing God's sovereignty and the relationship between Him and His people. It underscores that the laws are not arbitrary but are rooted in God's character and His desire for His people to reflect His holiness. This statement also points to the ultimate fulfillment of the law in Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodies the holiness and righteousness of God (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary audience of this command, as <a href="/bsb/leviticus/22.htm">Leviticus 22</a> addresses the conduct and holiness required of the priests in their service to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the laws of Leviticus were given, setting them apart as God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship where the priests served and where God's presence dwelled among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The mediator of God's laws to the Israelites, including the laws found in Leviticus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who establishes these laws to maintain holiness among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The command in <a href="/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a> underscores the importance of holiness and separation from impurity.
