A hunchback or dwarf, due to their physical deformities, were seen as not meeting the ideal of physical wholeness. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel is called to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The physical requirements symbolize the spiritual perfection required by God, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the perfect High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>).<p><b>or who has an eye defect</b><br>An eye defect would impair a priest's ability to perform his duties, which required precision and attention to detail. In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical wholeness was often associated with spiritual and moral integrity. This requirement underscores the importance of clarity of vision, both physically and spiritually, in serving God. Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a> about the eye being the lamp of the body can be seen as a spiritual parallel, emphasizing the need for spiritual insight and purity.<p><b>a festering rash</b><br>A festering rash would render a priest ceremonially unclean, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13-14</a>, which deals extensively with skin diseases and their implications for ritual purity. The presence of such a condition would prevent a priest from participating in temple service, highlighting the importance of purity and cleanliness in approaching God. This requirement points to the need for inner purity, as emphasized in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, which asks who may ascend the hill of the Lord and stand in His holy place.<p><b>scabs</b><br>Scabs, like other skin conditions, were considered a form of impurity that disqualified a priest from service. This reflects the broader Levitical concern with maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle and the offerings presented there. The emphasis on physical purity serves as a type of the spiritual purity required by God, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to be cleansed from their sins.<p><b>or a crushed testicle</b><br>This condition would affect a priest's ability to fulfill the command to be fruitful and multiply, a key aspect of the covenantal blessings promised to Israel (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). In the ancient cultural context, fertility and the ability to produce offspring were highly valued. The requirement for physical wholeness in this area underscores the importance of life and vitality in the service of God. This can be seen as a type pointing to the life-giving power of Christ, who offers spiritual rebirth and eternal life (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a> is on the qualifications and conduct of the priests in Israel.

At the same time, it foreshadows the flawless High Priest, Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-15</a>), and reminds believers that God deserves the very best (<a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hunchback</b><p>&#8226; A man with a pronounced curvature of the spine could not perform priestly duties (<a href="/leviticus/21-20.htm">Leviticus 21:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The visible distortion suggested the weight of the Fall on the human body (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>) and would have distracted worshipers from the purity God required at His altar.<p>&#8226; By excluding such a man, God underlined that approach to His presence required wholeness of body&#8212;a concrete picture of the moral and spiritual wholeness He ultimately demands (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>dwarf</b><p>&#8226; Short stature here refers to a genetic or developmental condition that produced obvious disproportion.<p>&#8226; Again, the issue was not personal worth but ceremonial representation; the priest stood as a living symbol of Israel&#8217;s offering to God (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The restriction mirrors the standard for animal sacrifices, which also had to be without defect (<a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>eye defect</b><p>&#8226; An impaired or cloudy eye, strabismus, or loss of sight disqualified a priest.<p>&#8226; Clear vision symbolized spiritual insight (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>).

Hence the ancient Chaldee version of Jonathan translates it, "whose eyebrows lying cover his eyes." That is, the hair, of the eyebrows are so thick, heavy, and long, that they join together and cover his eyes, thus interfering with his eyesight, and rendering him unsightly in appearance.<p><span class= "bld">Or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his </span>eye.--Better, <span class= "ital">or hath a cataract or a fusion of the white and black in his eye, </span>as the administrators of the Law during the second Temple interpret the two defects here spoken of.<p><span class= "bld">Or be scurvy, or scabbed.</span>--According to the authorities in the time of Christ, both these are kinds of ulcers or scurvy; the former is a scab which is dry both within and without, whilst the second is a scab which is moist within and dry without, and which clings to a man till he dies.<p><span class= "bld">Or hath his stones broken.</span>--That is, one whose testicles are injured. This included several kinds of defectiveness, which are exhibited in the different renderings of the ancient versions, but all refer to the same seat of the blemish.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who is a hunchback</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;ib&#183;b&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1384.htm">Strong's 1384: </a> </span><span class="str2">Crookbacked, humpbacked</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dwarf,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1463;&#1428;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;aq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1851.htm">Strong's 1851: </a> </span><span class="str2">Crushed, small, thin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who has an eye</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
