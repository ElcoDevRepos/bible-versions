In the context of Leviticus, the sacrificial system was central to the Israelites' worship and relationship with God. The holiness of the offering is transferred to anything that comes into contact with it, emphasizing the sacredness of the sacrifices. This concept of holiness being transferred is seen throughout the Old Testament, where contact with holy objects or places required purification or consecration. It underscores the idea that holiness is not inherent in objects or people but is derived from God's presence and command. This can be seen as a type of Christ, whose holiness and righteousness are imputed to believers through faith.<p><b>and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment</b><br>The blood of the sacrifice was considered sacred and had specific instructions for handling. Blood, representing life, was a crucial element in the atonement process. The spattering of blood on a garment signifies the seriousness and sanctity of the sacrificial act. In the ancient Near Eastern context, blood was often used in rituals to symbolize purification and consecration. The New Testament echoes this symbolism, where the blood of Christ is seen as the ultimate atonement for sin, cleansing believers and making them righteous before God.<p><b>you must wash it in a holy place</b><br>The requirement to wash the garment in a holy place highlights the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the sacrificial process. The holy place, likely referring to the tabernacle or later the temple, was where God's presence dwelled among His people. Washing in a holy place ensured that the act of cleansing was done in a manner that respected the sacredness of the blood and the offering. This practice reflects the broader biblical theme of purification and the need for cleanliness before approaching God. It also points forward to the New Testament, where believers are called to live holy lives, set apart for God's purposes, through the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary individuals responsible for performing the sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The holy place where sacrifices were made and where garments would be washed if they were spattered with blood.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_offerings.htm">Sacrificial Offerings</a></b><br>The context of this verse is within the laws concerning offerings, specifically the sin offering, which was considered most holy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_contact.htm">Holiness in Contact</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes that whatever touches the flesh of the sacrifice becomes holy.
