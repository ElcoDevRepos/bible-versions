The altar mentioned is the altar of burnt offering, located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle. This altar is "before the LORD" because it is situated in the sacred space where God's presence dwells among His people. The high priest's movement from the Holy of Holies to the altar signifies the extension of atonement from the innermost sanctuary to the entire community. This act underscores the holiness required in approaching God and the need for purification of the place where sacrifices are offered.<p><b>and make atonement for it</b><br>Atonement involves the covering or removal of sin, allowing reconciliation between God and His people. The altar, though a sacred object, required purification due to the sinfulness of the people who used it. This reflects the pervasive nature of sin and the need for cleansing even in the instruments of worship. The concept of atonement is central to the sacrificial system and foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who cleanses not only the physical but also the spiritual defilement of humanity.<p><b>He is to take some of the bull&#8217;s blood and some of the goat&#8217;s blood</b><br>The use of both bull's and goat's blood highlights the comprehensive nature of the atonement process. The bull's blood was for the high priest and his household, while the goat's blood was for the people of Israel. This dual application signifies the need for both personal and communal purification. Blood, representing life, is the means by which atonement is made, as life is given in exchange for life. This prefigures the sacrificial death of Christ, whose blood was shed for the sins of all humanity, fulfilling the requirements of the law.<p><b>and put it on all the horns of the altar</b><br>The horns of the altar, located at its four corners, symbolize strength and power. Applying blood to the horns signifies the sanctification and consecration of the altar, ensuring that it is a fit place for offerings to God. This act of purification is necessary for the altar to function as a means of divine-human interaction. In a broader theological context, the horns can be seen as pointing to the power of Christ's sacrifice, which sanctifies and empowers believers to approach God with confidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, responsible for performing the atonement rituals on the Day of Atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Located before the LORD, it is the place where sacrifices are made and atonement is sought.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who prescribes the means of atonement and forgiveness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bull_and_the_goat.htm">The Bull and the Goat</a></b><br>Sacrificial animals whose blood is used for atonement, symbolizing purification and forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_atonement.htm">The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A significant annual event in the Jewish calendar focused on repentance and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The passage underscores the need for atonement to approach a holy God.
