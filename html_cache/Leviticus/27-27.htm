This distinction is rooted in the holiness code, which sets Israel apart from other nations. Unclean animals include pigs, camels, and certain birds and insects. The classification of animals as clean or unclean is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. This separation underscores the call for Israel to be holy and distinct, reflecting God's holiness.<p><b>then he may redeem it according to your valuation</b><br>Redemption here refers to the act of buying back something that has been dedicated to God. The valuation is determined by the priest, as outlined earlier in <a href="/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>. This process allows for flexibility in the dedication system, acknowledging that circumstances may change, and a person might need to retain the animal for practical reasons. The concept of redemption is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing God's redemptive work through Christ, who redeems humanity from sin.<p><b>and add a fifth of its value</b><br>Adding a fifth (20%) to the valuation serves as a penalty or surcharge for redeeming the dedicated item. This additional cost ensures that the act of redemption is taken seriously and that the dedication to God is honored. The principle of adding a fifth is consistent with other laws in Leviticus, such as those concerning restitution (<a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>). It reflects the importance of integrity and commitment in one's vows to God.<p><b>If it is not redeemed</b><br>If the owner chooses not to redeem the unclean animal, it remains dedicated to God. This decision might be due to financial constraints or a desire to fulfill the vow without alteration. The concept of not redeeming something dedicated to God emphasizes the seriousness of vows and the expectation that they be fulfilled as promised.<p><b>then it shall be sold according to your valuation</b><br>Selling the unredeemed animal ensures that its value is still consecrated to God, even if the animal itself is not used in worship. The sale proceeds would likely go to the sanctuary or the priests, supporting the religious community. This practice highlights the principle of stewardship and the importance of honoring one's commitments to God. The valuation by the priest ensures fairness and consistency in the process.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, guiding their worship and daily living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_animals.htm">Unclean Animals</a></b><br>- Animals considered ceremonially unclean according to the Mosaic Law, which could not be offered as sacrifices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>- The individuals responsible for overseeing the valuation and redemption process as described in the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The place where offerings and sacrifices were made, central to the worship practices of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_redemption.htm">Understanding Redemption</a></b><br>The concept of redemption in <a href="/leviticus/27-27.htm">Leviticus 27:27</a> illustrates the broader biblical theme of redemption, where something unclean or unworthy is made valuable through a price paid.

They could not be offered on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/27-11.htm">Leviticus 27:11</a>), yet people might still dedicate them to the LORD in a vow.<p>- God&#8217;s law makes room for such sincerity without compromising holiness. The animal itself is unacceptable for sacrifice, but the heart behind the vow is honored through another route.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He may redeem it</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230; then he may redeem it &#8230;&#8221;.<p>- &#8220;Redeem&#8221; means the owner can buy back the animal from sacred service. This echoes <a href="/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>, where a firstborn donkey&#8212;also an unclean animal&#8212;could be redeemed with a lamb.<p>- God&#8217;s pattern: what cannot approach Him directly can still be ransomed, a picture later fulfilled in Christ who &#8220;redeemed us&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to your valuation</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230; according to your valuation &#8230;&#8221;.<p>- Earlier in the chapter the priest set fair market value (<a href="/leviticus/27-12.htm">Leviticus 27:12</a>). The same impartial standard applies here; holiness never allows inflated or discounted figures.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD,&#8221; underscoring the call to honest valuation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Add a fifth of its value</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230; and add a fifth of its value.&#8221;<p>- That extra 20 percent appears elsewhere: <a href="/leviticus/22-14.htm">Leviticus 22:14, 6</a>:5; <a href="/numbers/5-7.htm">Numbers 5:7</a>.<p>- Reasons for the surcharge:<p>&#8226; It deters rash vows.<p>&#8226; It compensates the sanctuary for handling an animal it cannot use.<p>&#8226; It teaches that worship costs something&#8212;echoed when David said, &#8220;I will not offer &#8230; that which costs me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If it is not redeemed</b><p>- &#8220;If it is not redeemed &#8230;&#8221;.<p>- The owner has freedom to leave the animal. Failure to redeem, though, signals unwillingness to pay the added cost. Much like <a href="/exodus/34-20.htm">Exodus 34:20</a> (the firstborn donkey&#8217;s neck broken if not redeemed), neglect has consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then it shall be sold</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230; then it shall be sold according to your valuation.&#8221;<p>- The priest sells the animal; proceeds go to the sanctuary. No bargaining: the pre-set value stands.<p>- <a href="/leviticus/25-50.htm">Leviticus 25:50</a> shows the same principle in land redemption&#8212;God safeguards fairness while maintaining ownership rights.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/27-27.htm">Leviticus 27:27</a> teaches that even an unclean animal, unfit for sacrifice, can be brought under God&#8217;s lordship through redemption money. The owner may buy it back at the priest&#8217;s honest price plus 20 percent; if he refuses, the sanctuary sells it for that amount. The passage upholds God&#8217;s holiness, the integrity of vows, the costliness of redemption, and the fairness of divine valuation&#8212;principles that still call believers to honor commitments and remember the high price Christ paid to redeem us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And if it be of an unclean beast.</span>--That is, if he vows the firstling of an unclean beast he could redeem it according to the valuation of the priest with the addition of one-fifth over and above the fixed value. If he did not redeem it the treasurer of the sanctuary sold it to anyone who liked to buy it at this valuation, and the proceeds were devoted to the maintenance and repairs of the sanctuary. As this is at variance with the law laid down in <a href="/exodus/13-13.htm" title="And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.">Exodus 13:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-20.htm" title="But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.">Exodus 34:20</a>, where it is enacted that the firstborn of an ass is either to be redeemed with a sheep, or is to be put to death, the authorities during the second Temple interpreted the precept in the passage before us as not applying to the firstborn of the unclean animals, but to unclean animals generally which are dedicated for the repairs of the sanctuary.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/27-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
