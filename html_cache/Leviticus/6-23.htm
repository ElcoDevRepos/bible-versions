These offerings were typically given as an act of worship and thanksgiving to God. The grain offering for a priest, however, had specific regulations. Priests, who were descendants of Aaron, had a unique role in the sacrificial system, serving as mediators between God and the people. This particular regulation highlights the distinct nature of offerings made by priests, setting them apart from those made by the general Israelite population.<p><b>shall be burned completely</b><br>The complete burning of the grain offering signifies total dedication to God. Unlike other grain offerings where a portion could be consumed by the priests, this offering was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing the priest's complete devotion and service to God. The act of burning also represents purification and the transformation of the offering into a pleasing aroma to the Lord, as seen in other parts of Leviticus. This complete consumption by fire underscores the holiness required of the priestly office.<p><b>it is not to be eaten.</b><br>This prohibition against eating the priest's grain offering further emphasizes the sanctity and exclusivity of the priestly role. In other offerings, priests were allowed to partake as a means of sustenance, but in this case, the offering is wholly given to God. This regulation serves as a reminder of the priest's unique position and the need for purity and dedication in their service. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, as the perfect High Priest, offered Himself completely to God, fulfilling the law and providing eternal atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, chosen by God to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, performing sacrifices and rituals on behalf of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>A type of offering made from fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice that is completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the instructions for offerings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/total_dedication_to_god.htm">Total Dedication to God</a></b><br>The complete burning of the priest's grain offering symbolizes total dedication and surrender to God.
