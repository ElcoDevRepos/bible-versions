In ancient Israel, hair was often associated with identity and status, so removing it indicated humility and submission to God's cleansing process. This act parallels the Nazirite vow in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, where hair also plays a significant role in consecration and dedication to God.<p><b>He must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water,</b><br>Washing clothes and bathing are physical acts representing spiritual purification.

This ritual underscores the importance of both external and internal purity before re-entering the community.<p><b>and he will be clean.</b><br>The declaration of cleanliness signifies restoration to the community and to God. It reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and reconciliation, as seen in the New Testament where believers are cleansed by the blood of Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).
