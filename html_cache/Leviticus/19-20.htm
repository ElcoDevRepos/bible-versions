In ancient Israel, slavery was a part of the social structure, and laws were given to regulate and protect those in servitude. The term "lies carnally" indicates a sexual act, which in this context, is outside the bounds of marriage. The law here seeks to address the moral and social implications of such an act.<p><b>promised to another man</b><br>The slave girl is betrothed, indicating a formal agreement for marriage. Betrothal in ancient Israel was a binding contract, similar to marriage, and breaking it was considered a serious offense. This situation complicates the act, as it involves a breach of a future marital covenant.<p><b>but who has not been redeemed or given her freedom</b><br>The mention of redemption or freedom highlights the legal status of the slave girl. Redemption refers to the act of buying back or liberating a person from servitude, often through a financial transaction. The fact that she has not been redeemed or freed means she remains under the authority of her master, which affects the legal consequences of the act.<p><b>there must be due punishment</b><br>The requirement for punishment underscores the seriousness of the offense. The law demands accountability and justice, reflecting God's concern for order and righteousness. The nature of the punishment would be determined by the judges, taking into account the circumstances and the status of the individuals involved.<p><b>But they are not to be put to death</b><br>This clause provides a significant limitation on the punishment. Unlike adultery, which could warrant the death penalty under Mosaic Law, this situation does not meet the criteria for such a severe consequence. The distinction is made because the slave girl was not free, and thus, the full weight of the law for adultery does not apply.<p><b>because she had not been freed</b><br>The lack of freedom is a crucial factor in the legal decision. It implies that the slave girl did not have the autonomy to fully consent or refuse the act, which mitigates the severity of the punishment. This reflects a nuanced understanding of justice, taking into account the social and legal constraints on individuals in servitude.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/slave_girl.htm">Slave Girl</a></b><br>A female servant who is not free and is under the ownership of another person.

Scripture assumes the reality of servitude in ancient Israel while regulating it so that God&#8217;s holiness governs even hidden acts (cf. <a href="/exodus/21-20.htm">Exodus 21:20&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>). Sexual sin is never excused by social status differences (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>). The phrase &#8220;lies carnally&#8221; plainly refers to intercourse, reminding us that God&#8217;s law penetrates private behavior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>promised to another man</b><p>The woman is &#8220;promised&#8221; (betrothed) to someone else, meaning a covenantal commitment already exists (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>). Though she is not yet married, her pledge carries legal weight, underscoring that sexual faithfulness is expected before and after marriage (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but who has not been redeemed or given her freedom</b><p>Because she remains enslaved, her legal power to refuse may be limited. Redemption&#8212;the purchase of freedom (<a href="/leviticus/25-47.htm">Leviticus 25:47-55</a>)&#8212;has not occurred. Scripture recognizes her diminished agency; therefore her moral culpability differs from that of a free woman (compare <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>, &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there must be due punishment</b><p>God demands accountability. &#8220;Punishment&#8221; (literally &#8220;investigation&#8221; leading to correction) shows sin has consequences (<a href="/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6-7</a>). Though the woman&#8217;s freedom is restricted, the man&#8217;s responsibility is clear; he exploited a vulnerable person (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>). Restitution and sacrifice are detailed in the next verse (<a href="/leviticus/19-21.htm">Leviticus 19:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But they are not to be put to death</b><p>Adultery involving two free, consenting parties incurred capital punishment (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>). Here, that ultimate penalty is lifted. The law distinguishes circumstances without minimizing sin, reflecting God&#8217;s perfect balance of justice and mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because she had not been freed</b><p>Her bondage mitigates the sentence. The Lord defends the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/146-7.htm">Psalm 146:7</a>) and refuses to equate her situation with that of a free adulteress. While Scripture never trivializes immorality, it consistently protects those with limited power (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/19-20.htm">Leviticus 19:20</a> affirms that God&#8217;s moral law governs every social layer:<p>&#8226; Sexual purity is obligatory, irrespective of status.<p>&#8226; Engagement vows are sacred.<p>&#8226; Exploiting the powerless intensifies guilt.<p>&#8226; Justice is proportional, factoring in responsibility and capacity.<p>&#8226; Even in the Mosaic Law, mercy tempers punishment, foreshadowing Christ, who fully satisfies both justice and grace (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And whosoever lieth.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If a man lie, </span>as the same phrase is translated in the Authorised Version, <a href="/leviticus/22-14.htm" title="And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof to it, and shall give it to the priest with the holy thing.">Leviticus 22:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-19.htm" title="And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him;">Leviticus 24:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-29.htm" title="And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.">Leviticus 25:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-14.htm" title="And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.">Leviticus 27:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Betrothed to an husband.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">betrothed to a man. </span>From the law about the mixed seeds the Lawgiver passes to heterogeneous alliances. The case here legislated for is that of seducing a bondwoman who is espoused to another man. This bondwoman might be either one of an intermediate kind, that is, one whose redemption money had been partially paid, or belong to that class who had no prospect of a free discharge. According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, the case before us is that of a Canaanitish maid, partly free and partly servile, whom her master had espoused to a Hebrew slave. (See <a href="/exodus/21-4.htm" title="If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.">Exodus 21:4</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - A distinction is drawn between adultery with a free woman, or a betrothed free virgin, which was punishable with death (<a href="/leviticus/20-20.htm">Leviticus 20:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>), and with a slave betrothed to another man (probably a slave also). In the latter ease a lesser punishment, no doubt that of scourging (according to the Mishna to the extent of forty stripes), was to be inflicted on one or both, according to the circumstances of the case. The words, <span class="cmt_word">she shall he scourged</span>, should be translated, <span class="accented">there shall be investigation</span>, followed, presumably, by the punishment of scourging, for both parties if both were guilty, for one if the woman was unwilling. The man is afterwards to offer a trespass offering. As the offense has been a wrong as well as a sin, his offering is to be a trespass offering (see on Leviticus 5:14). In this case the fine of one-fifth could not be inflicted, as the wrong done could not be estimated by money, and the cost of the ram seems to be regarded as the required satisfaction. No mention is made of damages to be paid to the man to whom the slave-girl was betrothed, probably because he was himself a slave, and had not juridical rights against a freeman. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/19-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
