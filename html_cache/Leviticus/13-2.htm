In the ancient Near East, skin diseases were not only a health concern but also a matter of ritual purity. The Hebrew term often translated as "leprosy" in older versions of the Bible refers to a variety of skin conditions, not just Hansen's disease. The concern was both medical and spiritual, as such conditions could render a person ceremonially unclean.<p><b>that may be an infectious skin disease</b><br>The potential for the condition to be infectious highlights the need for careful examination and quarantine.

Priests were responsible for diagnosing and managing cases of skin disease, which underscores their role in maintaining the holiness of the community.

The verse foreshadows Christ&#8217;s priestly work and calls believers to vigilance, submission to godly authority, and a life guarded against any corruption that could spread through the body of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The word translated <span class="cmt_word">plague</span> of leprosy literally means <span class="accented">stroke.</span> It seems to be used in the sense of spot. <span class="cmt_word">Then shall he be brought unto Aaron the priest.</span> That the regulations respecting leprosy were not sanitary arrangements, as has been sometimes represented, is indicated by the authority over the leper being vested in the priest rather than in the physician, and the question of whether a man was a leper or no being decided by the former rather than the latter. It is to be noted also that the priest is not made unclean by his contact with the leper, because he is in the performance of his duty. The supposed leper may be brought either <span class="cmt_word">to Aaron or unto one of his sons the priests</span>; that is, to the high priest or to the ordinary priest, and those descendants of Aaron who were disqualified by physical infirmities from officiating at the altar were permitted to act as examiners in leprosy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">someone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a swelling</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7613.htm">Strong's 7613: </a> </span><span class="str2">An elevation, leprous scab, elation, cheerfulness, exaltation in rank, character</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or rash</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(sap&#183;pa&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5597.htm">Strong's 5597: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eruption, scab</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bright spot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#183;he&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_934.htm">Strong's 934: </a> </span><span class="str2">A whitish spot on the skin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on his skin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wr-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
