Removing the blasphemer from the camp symbolized the separation of sin from the community. This act reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, emphasizing the need to maintain purity within the community. The concept of being "outside the camp" is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>, where Jesus suffered outside the city gate, symbolizing His bearing of sin and separation for the sake of sanctification.<p><b>and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head</b><br>The laying on of hands in this context signifies the transfer of guilt and responsibility. Those who witnessed the blasphemy were required to affirm the truth of the accusation, ensuring that the punishment was just. This act also served as a communal acknowledgment of the sin, reinforcing the seriousness of blasphemy against God. The laying on of hands is seen in other contexts, such as in the ordination of priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a>) and the transfer of sins to the scapegoat (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>).<p><b>then have the whole assembly stone him</b><br>Stoning was a communal act of judgment, reflecting the collective responsibility of the community to uphold God's laws. It served as a deterrent against sin and maintained the sanctity of God's name. The severity of the punishment underscores the gravity of blasphemy, which was considered a direct affront to God's holiness. This method of execution is seen in other instances of capital punishment in the Old Testament, such as in the case of Achan (<a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>) and the man who violated the Sabbath (<a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>).

This imposition of hands upon a criminal was peculiar to the blasphemer who was sentenced to death, and according to the Jewish canonists, the witnesses and the judges thereby declared that the testimony and the sentence were faithful and righteous, and at the same time uttered the solemn words, "Let thy blood be upon thine own head; thou hast brought this upon thyself."<p><span class= "bld">Let all the congregation stone him.</span>--The witnesses, who are the representatives of the people, cast the first stone, and then all the people who stood by covered the convict with stones.
