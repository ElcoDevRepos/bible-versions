The simplicity of the linen garments points to the humility of Christ, who took on human form (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>) and served as our High Priest.

The verse safeguards the office&#8217;s legitimacy, highlights the need for holiness, and foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfills every detail and secures eternal redemption for all who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And the priest, whom he shall anoint.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the priest who shall be anointed. </span>Not only is Aaron to make atonement on this occasion, but, in future, the priest who shall be consecrated by the proper authorities as his successor to the pontificate shall perform this act of expiation on the Day of Atonement.<p><span class= "bld">And whom he shall consecrate.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and who shall be consecrated. </span>According to the canonical interpretation which obtained during the second Temple, this clause makes the hereditary right to the high priesthood conditional. Unlike property, which descends to the heirs unconditionally, the son of the high priest can only succeed his father if he is morally and physically blameless. The decision upon these points was vested in the community, represented by their elders--the Sanhedrin--who pronounced whether the heir apparent was qualified or disqualified to step into the office of pontiff, and who appointed the delegates to anoint and invest the new high priest with the insignia of his functions.<p><span class= "bld">And shall put on the linen clothes.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and shall put on the linen garments, </span>as it is rendered in the Authorised Version in <a href="/leviticus/16-23.htm" title="And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:">Leviticus 16:23</a>. This phrase only occurs twice, and in this very section. To render it by two different expressions within so short a space is almost equivalent to depriving it of its identity. Now the priest who has thus been deemed worthy to succeed to this high office is to put on the holy white garments on the Day of Atonement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - That there may be no mistake, it is specifically enjoined that not only Aaron, but <span class="cmt_word">the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate</span> - meaning, <span class="accented">the high priest that shall be anointed, and shall be consecrated</span> - <span class="cmt_word">to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead</span> - that is, to succeed from time to time to the high priesthood - <span class="cmt_word">shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes</span>, even <span class="cmt_word">the holy garments</span>.
