The goat represents the sin offering, a substitutionary sacrifice, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.

The repetition of the ritual with both animals emphasizes the thoroughness required for atonement.<p><b>He is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it</b><br>The mercy seat, the cover of the Ark of the Covenant, represents God's throne and His presence among His people. Sprinkling the blood on and before the mercy seat signifies the appeasement of God's wrath and the reconciliation between God and Israel.

On the north side of the altar he slew the goat which the lot had destined for God, and which was the sin offering for the people. As in the case of the bullock, which was his own sin offering, he caught the blood in the bowl, and went within the Holy of Holies a third time. He placed himself in the same position as before, sprinkled and counted the sprinklings in the same manner, and, on his returning to the Holy place, put the vessel on another stand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The third entry was made as soon as he had killed the goat which formed a moiety of the sin offering of the congregation, when <span class="cmt_word">he brought his blood</span> likewise <span class="cmt_word">within the vail, and did with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock,</span> sprinkling it the same number of times as before.
