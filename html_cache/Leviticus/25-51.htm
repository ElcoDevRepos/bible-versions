The concept of time remaining is crucial in determining the redemption price for a person who has sold themselves into servitude due to debt. The longer the time until the Jubilee, the higher the redemption price, reflecting the value of the labor that would be lost by the master. This principle underscores the importance of the Jubilee as a time of restoration and freedom, reflecting God's desire for His people to live in liberty and equality.<p><b>he must pay for his redemption</b><br>Redemption here involves the act of buying back one's freedom. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption, where God redeems His people from slavery and sin. The concept of redemption is central to the Christian faith, with Jesus Christ being the ultimate Redeemer who pays the price for humanity's sins (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). In the context of Leviticus, redemption is a legal and economic transaction, but it also points to the spiritual redemption that Christ provides.<p><b>in proportion to his purchase price</b><br>The redemption price is calculated based on the original purchase price and the number of years remaining until the Jubilee. This ensures fairness and justice in economic transactions, reflecting God's concern for equity and righteousness. The principle of proportionality is seen throughout Scripture, emphasizing that God's laws are just and balanced. This also foreshadows the idea that Christ's sacrifice is sufficient and perfectly proportionate to cover the sins of humanity, fulfilling the law's demands completely (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, receiving laws and instructions from God through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society occurring every 50 years, where slaves were freed, debts forgiven, and land returned to original owners.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/redeemer.htm">Redeemer</a></b><br>A person who could buy back a relative sold into slavery, reflecting the concept of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_redemption.htm">Understanding Redemption</a></b><br>Redemption involves a cost, reflecting the value and dignity of the individual.

The longer the period, the higher the remaining value of the servant&#8217;s labor.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently ties time to value: a Hebrew servant served six years, with freedom in the seventh (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>).
