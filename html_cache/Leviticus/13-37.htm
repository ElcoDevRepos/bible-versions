The unchanged nature of the outbreak suggests stability, indicating that the condition is not spreading or worsening. In the context of ancient Israel, skin diseases were not only health concerns but also had significant ritual implications. The priest's role was both medical and spiritual, ensuring the community's purity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>.<p><b>and black hair has grown in it</b><br>The growth of black hair in the affected area is a sign of healing. In the ancient Near East, hair color and texture were indicators of health. Black hair, in this context, signifies vitality and the return to a normal state. This detail underscores the thoroughness of the Levitical laws in diagnosing and treating skin conditions. The emphasis on hair color can be linked to the broader biblical symbolism of life and restoration, as seen in the story of Samson in <a href="/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a>, where hair is a symbol of strength and divine favor.<p><b>then it has healed</b><br>The declaration of healing is significant in the Levitical system, as it allows the individual to reintegrate into the community. Healing is not just a physical restoration but also a spiritual and social one. This reflects the holistic view of health in the Bible, where physical, spiritual, and communal well-being are interconnected. The concept of healing in the Bible often points to God's power and mercy, as seen in the healing miracles of Jesus in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/matthew/8.htm">Matthew 8:1-4</a>.<p><b>He is clean</b><br>Being pronounced clean has profound implications for the individual. It means restoration to full participation in the religious and social life of Israel. The concept of cleanliness in Leviticus is closely tied to the idea of holiness and being set apart for God. This declaration can be seen as a type of the cleansing from sin that is offered through Jesus Christ, as described in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, where the blood of Jesus purifies believers from all sin.<p><b>and the priest is to pronounce him clean</b><br>The priest's pronouncement is authoritative and final, reflecting the priestly role as mediator between God and the people. This act of pronouncement is a public declaration of the individual's restored status. It highlights the importance of community and the role of religious leaders in maintaining the spiritual health of the nation. This can be connected to the New Testament role of Jesus as our High Priest, who intercedes for us and declares us clean before God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests were responsible for diagnosing and declaring the cleanliness or uncleanness of individuals with skin diseases.

In Israel, priests served as public health inspectors (<a href="/leviticus/13-2.htm">Leviticus 13:2&#8211;3</a>). God delegated them the task of discerning between clean and unclean, foreshadowing the greater Priest who would one day declare healing with perfect authority (<a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the scaly outbreak is unchanged</b><p>An unchanged spot meant the suspected infection had not spread (<a href="/leviticus/13-5.htm">Leviticus 13:5&#8211;6</a>). Two weeks of observation were usually enough to reveal whether the condition was active or static. Stability signaled safety:<p>&#8226; No enlargement of the lesion<p>&#8226; No new spots appearing nearby<p>&#8226; Skin texture remaining the same<p>Waiting for visible proof guarded both the infected person and the community (<a href="/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and black hair has grown in it</b><p>Hair color was a diagnostic clue. Earlier, white hair in a lesion identified a serious skin disease (<a href="/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3, 13</a>:10). Black hair, the normal color for most Israelites, showed health returning to the follicle. Healthy hair growth testified that life, not decay, was present&#8212;an everyday sign of God&#8217;s design at work (<a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then it has healed</b><p>God built the human body with intrinsic healing processes (<a href="/psalms/103-2.htm">Psalm 103:2-3</a>). When those processes finished their work, the priest acknowledged the cure. The statement &#8220;it has healed&#8221; reflects objective reality, not wishful thinking, just as Naaman&#8217;s flesh &#8220;was restored like the flesh of a little child&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is clean</b><p>&#8220;Clean&#8221; restored more than hygiene; it restored community. Until this verdict, the sufferer was barred from normal life (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). Now he could reenter worship, commerce, and family gatherings. Physical restoration pointed to the deeper cleansing God offers from sin (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the priest is to pronounce him clean</b><p>The priest&#8217;s declaration made the healing official (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a>). A spoken word changed the man&#8217;s status, much like Jesus&#8217; statement to the leper: &#8220;Be clean!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-13.htm">Luke 5:13-14</a>). Public affirmation protected the healed person from suspicion and reminded Israel that purity comes through God-ordained mediation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-37.htm">Leviticus 13:37</a> shows a careful, God-given process: observation, confirmation, healing, and declaration. When the lesion stayed the same and black hair returned, the priest could confidently pronounce the person clean. The verse underlines God&#8217;s concern for bodily health, community order, and the authoritative word that restores people to full fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">But if the scall be in his sight at a stay.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">But if the appearance of the scall hath remained the same.</span><p><span class= "bld">And that there is black hair grown up therein.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And if black hair hath, </span>&c. If, in addition to its not spreading, the healthy colour of the hair has returned, it shows that the patient is cured of the leprosy, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. (See <a href="/leviticus/13-31.htm" title="And if the priest look on the plague of the scale, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague of the scale seven days:">Leviticus 13:31</a>.) According to the adminstrators of the law, there had at least to be two black hairs, of such a length that the top could bow towards the root. If two hairs grew up on the healed scall, one black and the other white or yellow, or one long and the other short, the patient could not be declared clean.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
