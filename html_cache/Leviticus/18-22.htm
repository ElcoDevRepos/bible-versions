The context of this command is the broader call for Israel to be distinct from the surrounding nations, particularly the Canaanites and Egyptians, whose practices were considered detestable by God. The phrase "lie with" is a euphemism for sexual relations, indicating a prohibition against homosexual acts. This command is part of a larger set of laws intended to maintain the purity and holiness of the Israelite community. The cultural context of the time viewed family and procreation as central to societal stability, and any sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage was seen as a threat to this order. This command is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26-27</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>, where similar prohibitions are reiterated, emphasizing the continuity of this moral standard.<p><b>that is an abomination.</b><br>The term "abomination" is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe actions that are detestable or repugnant to God. In the context of Leviticus, it often refers to practices that are ritually or morally impure. The use of this term underscores the severity with which God views the act described. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the word "abomination" was used to describe practices that were not only religiously offensive but also socially disruptive. Theologically, this term indicates a violation of the created order as established by God. The concept of abomination is linked to the holiness of God and His desire for His people to reflect His character. This phrase serves as a reminder of the call to holiness and the importance of adhering to God's standards. The use of "abomination" in this context is consistent with other biblical passages that address sexual immorality, reinforcing the idea that such actions are incompatible with a life dedicated to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, Moses was the leader of the Israelites and the mediator of God's laws to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the laws in Leviticus, the Israelites were God's chosen people, set apart to live according to His statutes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people whose practices God deemed abominable, including those mentioned in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate lawgiver, who provided these commandments to guide the moral and spiritual conduct of His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites had been delivered, known for practices that God warned against, including those related to sexual immorality.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_design.htm">Understanding God's Design</a></b><br>God created male and female with distinct roles and purposes.
