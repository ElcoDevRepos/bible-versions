Anointing oil was a blend of olive oil and spices, as described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>. This oil was used exclusively for sacred purposes, emphasizing the sanctity of the tabernacle and its furnishings. The act of anointing with oil is a precursor to the New Testament practice of anointing with the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>, where Jesus is described as being anointed by God.<p><b>and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it;</b><br>The tabernacle was the portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. Anointing the tabernacle and its contents symbolized the dedication of these items to God&#8217;s service. This act of consecration ensured that everything within the tabernacle was holy and set apart for divine use. The anointing of the tabernacle foreshadows the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>, where the body is referred to as a temple of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>and so he consecrated them.</b><br>Consecration involves making something sacred or dedicating it to God. By anointing the tabernacle and its furnishings, Moses was following God&#8217;s command to sanctify these items for worship. This act of consecration is a type of Christ, who consecrates believers through His sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>. The consecration of the tabernacle parallels the believer's call to holiness, as stated in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, where Christians are urged to be holy in all conduct.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai.
