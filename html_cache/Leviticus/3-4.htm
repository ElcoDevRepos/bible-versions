The fat surrounding the kidneys was seen as the best part of the animal, symbolizing the offering of the best to God. The loins, being the central part of the body, indicate strength and vitality. This offering of the kidneys and fat signifies a complete and wholehearted dedication to God, reflecting the inner purity and devotion expected from the worshiper. The emphasis on the fat also points to the richness and abundance of the offering, aligning with the idea that God deserves the finest portions.<p><b>and the lobe of the liver</b><br>The liver was another vital organ in ancient sacrificial practices, often associated with life and purification. In the context of Leviticus, the removal of the liver's lobe signifies the removal of impurities and the dedication of life to God. The liver's role in purification rituals underscores the importance of holiness and cleanliness in approaching God. This act can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate purification through Christ, who cleanses believers from sin.<p><b>which he is to remove with the kidneys</b><br>The removal of these specific parts highlights the meticulous nature of the sacrificial process, ensuring that only the designated portions are offered to God. This careful attention to detail reflects the holiness and orderliness required in worship. The act of removal also symbolizes the separation from sin and the setting apart of what is holy. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of Christ's sacrifice, where He was set apart and offered wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the peace offerings described in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were to bring their offerings, including the peace offerings, as a central place of worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were responsible for performing the sacrifices and offerings as prescribed in the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice described in Leviticus, symbolizing fellowship and communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_peace_offering.htm">Understanding the Peace Offering</a></b><br>The peace offering was a voluntary act of worship, symbolizing peace and fellowship with God.

Verses 3&#8211;5 lay out the portions that &#8220;the priest shall burn on the altar&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>). Only specific inner parts are placed on the fire; the rest is shared by priest and worshiper (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>). The selection teaches that the most inward, valuable portions belong exclusively to the LORD, echoing &#8220;All fat belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both Kidneys</b><p>&#8226; Kidneys are hidden, vital organs. By requiring them for the altar, God claims what is most protected and essential.<p>&#8226; Elsewhere, kidneys symbolize the secret thoughts and motives searched by God (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). He wants the worshiper&#8217;s innermost being, not merely outward compliance (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Their placement on the fire points forward to Christ, who offered every hidden part of Himself in total obedience (<a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fat Near the Loins</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The fat on them near the loins&#8221; refers to the richest, most energy-laden tissues. In ancient life, fat was prized; surrendering it was costly.<p>&#8226; By burning this fat, the worshiper acknowledged that strength, prosperity, and pleasure rightly belong to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a> forbids Israel to eat any blood or fat, underscoring that life and abundance are the Creator&#8217;s domain alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Lobe of the Liver</b><p>&#8226; The liver regulates purification in the body; offering its &#8220;lobe&#8221; (a distinct flap) signifies giving God authority over cleansing and life processes (<a href="/leviticus/4-8.htm">Leviticus 4:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The liver was also used in later cultures for divination (<a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>), but here it is reserved for Yahweh, declaring that guidance must come from Him, not pagan practice (<a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ, our peace offering, fulfills this by becoming &#8220;our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Removal and Offering</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Which he is to remove with the kidneys&#8221; highlights careful obedience.

Casual worship dishonors the holiness of the LORD (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The removed parts are burned &#8220;as food, an aroma pleasing to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>), symbolizing fellowship secured through substitutionary sacrifice, foreshadowing the fragrant offering of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spiritual Lessons</b><p>&#8226; God deserves the deepest, choicest parts of our lives&#8212;affections, motives, resources (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p>&#8226; True fellowship with Him is founded on an atoning sacrifice, not human merit (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Careful obedience matters. Details in worship reflect the character of the One we serve (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; What is hidden from human eyes is fully seen by God; surrendering it brings peace (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/3-4.htm">Leviticus 3:4</a> directs that both kidneys, the surrounding fat, and the liver&#8217;s lobe be removed and burned. By reserving these hidden, valuable organs for Himself, God teaches that the innermost, richest elements of life belong to Him.
