The anointing signifies their consecration and dedication to the priestly office. The offering underscores the importance of purity and dedication in their service to God. The anointing of priests is a significant event, marking their official entry into service, and is reminiscent of the anointing of kings and prophets, indicating a divine appointment. This practice foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who was anointed by God to intercede for humanity.<p><b>a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering,</b><br>The use of fine flour in the offering signifies purity and quality, as fine flour was a refined product, free from impurities. A tenth of an ephah is a specific measure, indicating the precision and orderliness required in worship. The grain offering, or "minchah," was a tribute to God, symbolizing the fruits of human labor and the dedication of one's sustenance to the Lord. This offering is a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life, representing sustenance and provision for spiritual life. The regularity of the offering points to the continual need for dedication and reliance on God.<p><b>half of it in the morning and half in the evening.</b><br>The division of the offering into morning and evening portions highlights the concept of continual worship and devotion. This practice ensures that the priests begin and end their day with a focus on God, setting a pattern for daily life centered around divine service. It reflects the biblical principle of offering oneself to God at all times, as seen in <a href="/psalms/113-3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>, "From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised."

Mean</div><b>This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD</b><p>The verse opens by underscoring that the priests, and only the priests, are responsible for this specific act of worship. The offering is &#8220;to the LORD,&#8221; reminding us that all ministry is God-ward before it is man-ward (compare <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-9</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). By assigning this duty to Aaron and his sons, God establishes both order and accountability in worship, a pattern seen earlier when He set apart the tribe of Levi (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-1.htm">Leviticus 8:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the day he is anointed</b><p>The sacrifice coincides with the priest&#8217;s consecration day, emphasizing that service begins with dedication. <a href="/bsb/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> records that Aaron&#8217;s anointing involved blood and oil, symbolizing cleansing and empowerment. The same principle appears when Solomon consecrates the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5-9</a>) and when Jesus, our ultimate High Priest, begins His public ministry after His baptism and anointing by the Spirit (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a tenth of an ephah of fine flour</b><p>A tenth of an ephah&#8212;roughly 2 quarts or 2 liters&#8212;signals a measurable, deliberate gift, not a casual token. Fine flour points to quality; only the best belongs on God&#8217;s altar (<a href="/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7-8</a>). The exact measure recalls the manna gathered daily in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>), linking priestly provision with the Lord&#8217;s faithful supply.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a regular grain offering</b><p>Unlike the sin or burnt offerings, this grain offering contains no blood. It is an act of thanksgiving and dedication, celebrating fellowship with God (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>). Regularity speaks of consistency&#8212;much like the &#8220;continual burnt offering&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-6</a>) and the ongoing praise believers are urged to offer today (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>). The grain, once baked, produced a pleasing aroma, foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s fragrant sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>half of it in the morning</b><p>Morning sacrifice sets the tone for the day. <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a> says, &#8220;In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice.&#8221; The priest&#8217;s dawn offering mirrors daily devotion, placing God first. It also parallels the morning burnt offering required for the entire nation (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-39</a>), aligning personal priestly duty with corporate worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and half in the evening</b><p>Evening completes the daily cycle, bookending the day with worship (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>). By splitting the offering, God ensures continual remembrance&#8212;His priests are never off-duty spiritually. This rhythm anticipates Paul&#8217;s call to &#8220;pray without ceasing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>) and Jesus&#8217; pattern of morning and evening communion with the Father (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>; <a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a> teaches that priestly service must be God-focused, rooted in consecration, offered with the best we have, and practiced faithfully morning and evening.
