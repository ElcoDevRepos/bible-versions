This prohibition underscores the importance of offering the best to God, reflecting the principle of giving God the first and finest. The fat was often associated with abundance and richness, symbolizing the honor due to God.<p><b>from which a food offering may be presented to the LORD,</b><br>The food offerings, or sacrifices, were central to Israelite worship and included burnt offerings, peace offerings, and sin offerings. These offerings were a means of atonement and fellowship with God. The specific mention of animals suitable for offerings highlights the sacredness of these acts and the need for obedience in worship practices.<p><b>the one who eats it must be cut off from his people.</b><br>Being "cut off" implies a severe consequence, often understood as excommunication or even death. This reflects the seriousness of maintaining holiness and purity within the community. It emphasizes the communal responsibility to uphold God's commands and the need for individual accountability.

By touching what God has reserved for Himself, a person would be stealing from the altar. Consider how the sons of Eli seized the fat before it was offered and thus treated &#8220;the offering of the LORD with contempt&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15-17</a>). Scripture keeps reminding us that certain portions are holy, set apart exclusively for God (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of an animal from which a food offering may be presented to the LORD</b><p>The fat in view comes from animals suitable for sacrifice&#8212;cattle, sheep, or goats (<a href="/leviticus/7-23.htm">Leviticus 7:23</a>). These animals symbolize substitutionary atonement; therefore, their choicest parts are reserved for the altar (<a href="/leviticus/3-9.htm">Leviticus 3:9-11</a>). When Israel gave the best to God, they acknowledged His supremacy and their dependence (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-10.htm">Deuteronomy 26:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).
