Moses, as the leader and prophet of Israel, often received instructions from God to relay to the Israelites. This underscores the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where God is the ultimate authority. The phrase highlights the importance of divine instruction in the life of the Israelite community, particularly in matters of law and ritual purity. The use of "LORD" in all caps signifies the translation of the Tetragrammaton, YHWH, the personal name of God, which denotes His eternal and unchanging nature. This communication is part of the larger Levitical code, which provides guidelines for maintaining holiness and purity among God's people. The context of <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a> involves laws concerning the cleansing of lepers, which can be seen as a type of Christ's healing ministry, where He cleanses and restores those who are spiritually and physically unclean. This connection is further emphasized in the New Testament, where Jesus heals lepers, demonstrating His authority over physical and spiritual impurity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate authority and lawgiver in the Israelite community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_community.htm">Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context involves the community of Israel, who are receiving these laws as part of their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_communication.htm">Divine Communication</a></b><br>God speaks directly to His chosen leaders, emphasizing the importance of listening to His voice and guidance in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_mediators.htm">Role of Mediators</a></b><br>Just as Moses was a mediator for Israel, Jesus is our mediator today.

(See <a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 13:1</a>.) The reason for this is probably that Moses was designed by God as the great law-giver and teacher of the priesthood as well as of the laity.<p>THE FORM OF PURIFICATION OF THE LEPER (<a href="/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1-32</a>). This is the most minute of all the forms of purification, those for purification from contact with a dead body (<a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>) and for the cleansing of a defiled Nazarite (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>) being alone to be compared with it in this respect. Some purifications were accomplished, as we have seen, in a very summary manner: one who touched the carcass of a beast that had died a natural death had only to wash his clothes (<a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a>). The greater and more significative the defilement, the more careful and the more significative must be the cleansing. Leprous uncleanness excluded the leper both from the camp and from the sanctuary, from the rights both of citizen. ship and of Church-membership, with which the rights of the family were also associated; consequently there had to be a double form of restoration, each with its special ceremonies. The manner of the first reconciliation is detailed in verses 1-8, of the second in verses 9-32. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/leviticus/14-1.htm">OT Law: Leviticus 14:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses saying (Le Lv Lev.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/leviticus/13-59.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Leviticus 13:59"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 13:59" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Leviticus 14:2"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 14:2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
