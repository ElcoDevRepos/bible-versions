The Israelites are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, chosen by God to be His people. This phrase underscores the importance of communication from God to His chosen people, highlighting the role of Moses as a mediator. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s desire to dwell among His people and guide them.<p><b>and say to them</b><br>This phrase indicates the importance of verbal communication in the transmission of God&#8217;s laws and instructions. In the ancient Near Eastern context, oral tradition was a primary means of preserving and conveying important information. This command ensures that the Israelites receive direct and clear instructions from God, reinforcing the authority of the message.<p><b>&#8216;These are My appointed feasts</b><br>The term "appointed feasts" refers to specific times set by God for the Israelites to gather and worship. These feasts are divinely ordained and are not merely cultural or traditional events. They serve as reminders of God&#8217;s provision and faithfulness. The feasts also have prophetic significance, foreshadowing events in the life of Jesus Christ, such as Passover pointing to His sacrificial death.<p><b>the feasts of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that these feasts belong to God, not to the people. They are sacred times established by God for His purposes. The feasts are opportunities for the Israelites to remember and celebrate God&#8217;s acts of salvation and provision. They also serve as a means of maintaining the community&#8217;s identity and unity under God&#8217;s covenant.<p><b>that you are to proclaim</b><br>The act of proclaiming these feasts involves making them known publicly and ensuring that the entire community is aware of their significance. This proclamation is a communal responsibility, ensuring that each generation understands and participates in these sacred times. It reflects the importance of teaching and passing down God&#8217;s commandments.<p><b>as sacred assemblies</b><br>The term "sacred assemblies" indicates that these gatherings are holy and set apart for worship and reflection. They are not ordinary meetings but are times dedicated to God, requiring the Israelites to cease from regular work and focus on spiritual matters. These assemblies foster a sense of community and shared faith, reinforcing the Israelites&#8217; identity as God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom the laws and commandments were given.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who establishes the feasts as sacred times for His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/appointed_feasts.htm">Appointed Feasts</a></b><br>Specific times set by God for the Israelites to gather, worship, and remember His deeds and promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_assemblies.htm">Sacred Assemblies</a></b><br>Holy gatherings where the community comes together to worship and honor God, distinct from ordinary gatherings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God communicated His laws and instructions to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacred_time.htm">Understanding Sacred Time</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of setting aside specific times for worship and reflection, as God commanded the Israelites to do.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>Emphasize the value of gathering with fellow believers to honor God, drawing strength and encouragement from one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembrance_and_celebration.htm">Remembrance and Celebration</a></b><br>Use appointed times to remember God's faithfulness and celebrate His ongoing work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_worship.htm">Holiness in Worship</a></b><br>Approach worship with reverence and a heart prepared to meet with God, acknowledging the sacredness of these gatherings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_fulfillment.htm">Christ as Fulfillment</a></b><br>Reflect on how the feasts point to Christ and find their ultimate fulfillment in Him, deepening our understanding of His work.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_23_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 23:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Feasts_in_Leviticus_23_and_their_meaning.htm">What are the "appointed feasts" mentioned in Leviticus 23:2, and their significance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_s_feasts_today.htm">How can we honor God's "appointed feasts" in our modern Christian practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_holy_convocations.htm">Why does God emphasize "holy convocations" in Leviticus 23:2, and what does it mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_of_Lev_23_feasts_to_New_Testament.htm">How do the "appointed feasts" in Leviticus 23:2 connect to New Testament teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Lev_23_2_for_today_s_worship.htm">What lessons from Leviticus 23:2 can we apply to our worship today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Feasts_in_Leviticus_23_2_significance.htm">What are the appointed feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23:2, and why are they significant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_23_2_and_sacred_time_link.htm">How does Leviticus 23:2 relate to the concept of sacred time in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_must_Israelites_observe_feasts.htm">Why does God command the Israelites to observe these feasts in Leviticus 23:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_23.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_holy_days_of_obligation.htm">What are the Holy Days of Obligation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_bible's_jewish_feasts.htm">What are the Jewish feasts and festivals in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_visible_vs._invisible_church.htm">What are the religious festivals mentioned in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_high_sabbath.htm">What defines a high Sabbath?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Leviticus 23:2 Mean</div><b>Speak to the Israelites</b><p>God begins by telling Moses to address the covenant people directly.
