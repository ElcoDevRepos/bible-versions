The term "acts unfaithfully" implies a breach of trust or covenant with God, even if done unintentionally. The "LORD&#8217;s holy things" refers to items or practices set apart for worship, such as offerings, tithes, or sacred rituals. This highlights the importance of maintaining reverence for what is consecrated to God. The idea of unintentional sin is also seen in <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-29</a>, emphasizing the need for atonement even when the sin is not deliberate.<p><b>he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD</b><br>The guilt offering, or "asham" in Hebrew, is distinct from other offerings like the sin offering. It specifically addresses offenses that require restitution, often involving a breach of faithfulness. This offering underscores the necessity of acknowledging wrongdoing and seeking reconciliation with God. The act of bringing the offering to the LORD signifies personal responsibility and the desire to restore the relationship with God.<p><b>an unblemished ram from the flock</b><br>The requirement for an "unblemished ram" signifies the need for purity and perfection in offerings to God. This reflects the holiness of God and the seriousness of sin. The ram, a valuable animal, indicates the costliness of atonement. This foreshadows Christ as the perfect, unblemished sacrifice for sin, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, where Jesus is described as a lamb without blemish or defect.<p><b>of proper value in silver shekels according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The specification of "proper value in silver shekels" according to the sanctuary shekel standardizes the offering, ensuring fairness and consistency. The sanctuary shekel was a specific weight used in the tabernacle, emphasizing the importance of precision and integrity in worship. This reflects the broader biblical principle of just measures and weights, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>.<p><b>it is a guilt offering</b><br>The designation "guilt offering" highlights the nature of the offense and the need for restitution. This offering not only seeks forgiveness but also involves making amends, often requiring additional compensation to the offended party. The guilt offering points to the comprehensive nature of atonement, addressing both the spiritual and relational aspects of sin. This concept is further developed in <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where the suffering servant (a type of Christ) is described as a guilt offering, underscoring the redemptive work of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and requires holiness from His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinner.htm">The Sinner</a></b><br>An individual who has acted unfaithfully and sinned unintentionally against the holy things of the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_things.htm">Holy Things</a></b><br>Items or practices set apart for worship and service to God, which require reverence and proper handling.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offering.htm">Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice required to atone for certain sins, particularly those involving the misuse of holy things.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary_shekel.htm">Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>A standard of measurement used in the valuation of offerings, ensuring fairness and consistency in the sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_unintentional_sin.htm">Understanding Unintentional Sin</a></b><br>Recognize that even unintentional sins require atonement, underscoring the pervasive nature of sin and the holiness of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_holy_things.htm">The Importance of Holy Things</a></b><br>Reflect on how we treat what is sacred in our lives, such as worship, Scripture, and the community of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_restitution.htm">The Role of Restitution</a></b><br>Consider the importance of making amends when we wrong others or misuse what is dedicated to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_guilt_offering.htm">Christ as Our Guilt Offering</a></b><br>Embrace the truth that Jesus is our ultimate guilt offering, providing complete atonement for our sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/valuation_and_fairness.htm">Valuation and Fairness</a></b><br>Appreciate the fairness and justice in God's requirements, as seen in the use of the sanctuary shekel for valuation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_5_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 5:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_5_15_Restitution_for_sins.htm">How does Leviticus 5:15 emphasize the importance of restitution for unintentional sins?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_unblemished_ram_in_guilt_atonement.htm">What role does the "ram without blemish" play in atoning for guilt?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Using_restitution_daily_how.htm">How can we apply the principle of restitution in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Leviticus_5_15_to_Jesus_sacrifice.htm">How does Leviticus 5:15 connect with Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Why_acknowledge_unintentional_sin_3.htm">Why is acknowledging unintentional sin important for maintaining a relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_guilt_offering_in_Lev_5_15.htm">What is the significance of a "guilt offering" in Leviticus 5:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_5_15_sin_and_atonement_link.htm">How does Leviticus 5:15 relate to the concept of sin and atonement?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_a_ram_offered_in_Lev_5_15.htm">Why is a ram specified as the offering in Leviticus 5:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_god_the_source_of_all.htm">What does 'trespass' mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_a_trespass_offering.htm">What is a trespass offering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'trespass'_mean_in_the_bible.htm">What does "trespass" mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/was_jesus_without_sin.htm">Was Jesus sinless?
