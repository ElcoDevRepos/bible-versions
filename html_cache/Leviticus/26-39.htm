Historically, this was fulfilled during the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities. The concept of living in the "lands of your enemies" underscores the loss of the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing separation from God's blessing and presence. This exile serves as a physical manifestation of spiritual estrangement from God. Theologically, it foreshadows the New Testament theme of believers being sojourners in a world that is not their home (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>).<p><b>will waste away in their iniquity</b><br>The idea of "wasting away" suggests a gradual decline, both physically and spiritually, due to persistent sin. This reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The Israelites' iniquity, or moral corruption, is seen as the root cause of their suffering. This phrase highlights the consequences of breaking the covenant with God, emphasizing the justice of God in dealing with sin. It also serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>and will decay in the sins of their fathers</b><br>This part of the verse points to the generational impact of sin, where the consequences of the fathers' sins affect their descendants. It reflects the biblical concept of corporate responsibility and the idea that the sins of one generation can have repercussions for the next (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). This decay is not just physical but also spiritual, indicating a deep-seated corruption that affects the community's relationship with God. Theologically, it underscores the need for repentance and renewal, themes that are central to the prophetic messages in the Old Testament. It also points to the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who breaks the cycle of sin and offers new life (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, the Israelites are God's chosen people, receiving the laws and commandments through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who delivered God's laws to the Israelites, including the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where the Israelites were to live in obedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies'_lands.htm">Enemies' Lands</a></b><br>Refers to the foreign lands where the Israelites would be exiled due to their disobedience and iniquity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>The sin and moral corruption that led to the Israelites' punishment and exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has real and lasting consequences, not only for the individual but also for future generations.

God never leaves Himself without witnesses; even amid discipline He preserves a portion of His people (cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). Yet survival alone does not equal blessing; it can be a sober opportunity to grasp God&#8217;s holiness and turn back to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the lands of your enemies</b><p>The survivors are not at home but exiled, scattered among hostile nations. Exile fulfills the covenant warnings first given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36-37</a> and realized in <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; 25:11. Living under foreign rule strips away the comforts of the promised land, reminding the people that genuine security is found only in obedience to the LORD (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will waste away in their iniquity</b><p>&#8220;To waste away&#8221; paints a picture of gradual physical and spiritual erosion. Sin is never static; it eats away at life and vitality (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4-6</a>). Here, wasting is the direct consequence of &#8220;their iniquity&#8221;&#8212;personal, unrepented rebellion. The exile environment intensifies the realization that sin carries tangible, painful fallout (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will decay in the sins of their fathers</b><p>The decay encompasses inherited patterns. Though each person answers for his own sin (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>), the effects of previous generations&#8217; disobedience linger (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>). Exile exposes how unchecked sin compounds through families and communities, creating a legacy of suffering. Yet the fact that these survivors remain alive reveals God&#8217;s ongoing invitation to repentance (<a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40-42</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a> warns that even the spared remnant will endure the slow erosion of sin&#8212;both personal and generational&#8212;while living under enemy domination. The verse underscores that survival without repentance leads to wasting and decay; only turning back to the covenant-keeping God can reverse the trajectory and restore true life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">But those that remain of you shall pine away because of their iniquity, </span>that is, those who will survive the terrible doom described under the five warnings, will pine away with grief, reflecting upon their sins which have brought upon them these tribulations.<p><span class= "bld">And also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and also on account of the iniquity of their fathers with them shall they pine away, </span>that is, they shall pine away on account of their ancestral sins, which they repeat and reproduce.

It may, however, also be rendered, "And also on account of the iniquities of their fathers which are with them;" that is, which they must bear and expiate.
