In the context of circumcision, it marks the completion of a week, a full cycle, and the start of a new phase in the child's life. The number eight is also associated with resurrection and regeneration, as seen in the New Testament with Jesus' resurrection occurring on the first day of the week, which is the eighth day in a continuous cycle.<p><b>the flesh of the boy&#8217;s foreskin</b><br>Circumcision involves the removal of the foreskin, a physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). This act is deeply rooted in Jewish identity and religious practice, serving as a tangible reminder of their unique relationship with God. The physical act of circumcision is symbolic of spiritual purification and dedication to God, setting the Israelites apart from other nations.<p><b>is to be circumcised</b><br>Circumcision is a commandment given by God to Abraham and his descendants, signifying their covenant with Him. It is a rite of passage that integrates the child into the community of God's people. In the New Testament, circumcision is reinterpreted as a spiritual act, with the Apostle Paul emphasizing the circumcision of the heart (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>), pointing to a deeper, inward transformation. This foreshadows the new covenant established through Jesus Christ, where physical circumcision is no longer required, but faith and obedience to God are paramount.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.
