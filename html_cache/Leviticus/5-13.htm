The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, highlighting the necessity of an intermediary in the process of reconciliation with God. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who makes atonement for humanity's sins once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>). The phrase "any of these sins" refers to unintentional sins or sins of omission, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of atonement available under the law. The sacrificial system underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and he will be forgiven</b><br>Forgiveness is a key theme in the Bible, and here it is granted through the prescribed sacrificial system. This forgiveness is not merely a legal pardon but a restoration of the relationship between the sinner and God. The assurance of forgiveness upon the completion of the sacrificial ritual points to God's mercy and willingness to restore His people. This anticipates the New Testament teaching of forgiveness through Christ's sacrifice, where believers are assured of forgiveness and reconciliation with God (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><b>The remainder will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.</b><br>The portion of the offering that belongs to the priest serves as a provision for those who serve in the temple, reflecting the principle that those who minister in holy things should be supported by the offerings of the people (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). The comparison to the grain offering, which was also partially consumed by the priests, indicates a continuity in the sacrificial system where the priests are sustained by the offerings. This practice underscores the communal aspect of worship and the support of religious leaders, a principle that continues in various forms in Christian communities today.<div class="vheading2">Persons
