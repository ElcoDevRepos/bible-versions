The presentation signifies their consecration and readiness to serve in the tabernacle. This act is a fulfillment of God's instructions given earlier in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, where Aaron and his sons were chosen to serve as priests. The presentation also underscores the importance of lineage and the hereditary nature of the priesthood in Israel.<p><b>put tunics on them</b><br>The tunics were simple garments that symbolized purity and righteousness. In the context of the priesthood, these garments set Aaron's sons apart for holy service. The tunics are part of the prescribed priestly attire detailed in <a href="/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>, emphasizing the need for the priests to be clothed in a manner befitting their sacred duties. This act of clothing also prefigures the righteousness of Christ, who clothes believers in His righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>wrapped sashes around them</b><br>The sashes, or girdles, were functional and symbolic, representing readiness for service and the binding of the priestly garments. The act of wrapping sashes around the priests signifies their commitment and dedication to their roles.

The headband was a mark of their office and a reminder of their role as mediators between God and the people. This element of the priestly garments is reminiscent of the crown of righteousness that believers will receive (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>).<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase highlights the obedience of Moses to God's specific instructions. It underscores the importance of following divine commands precisely, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. The adherence to God's commands in the consecration of the priests reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience leading to blessing.
