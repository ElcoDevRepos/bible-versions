The live bird represents the new life and freedom from impurity. Birds, often seen as symbols of freedom and transcendence, are used here to signify the release from the bondage of disease. This act foreshadows the resurrection and ascension of Christ, who brings new life.<p><b>together with the cedar wood</b><br>Cedar wood is known for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing purification and longevity. In biblical times, cedar was used in the construction of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>), representing strength and permanence. It signifies the enduring nature of God's covenant and the purification process.<p><b>scarlet yarn</b><br>Scarlet yarn, or thread, is often associated with sin and redemption. <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> mentions, "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." The color red symbolizes both sin and the blood required for atonement, pointing to the sacrificial blood of Christ.<p><b>and hyssop</b><br>Hyssop is a plant used for purification and cleansing. It was used during the Passover to apply the lamb's blood to the doorposts (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>) and in purification rites (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>). Hyssop represents cleansing from sin and is a type of the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>and dip them into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered</b><br>The act of dipping the live bird, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop into the blood signifies the application of the sacrificial blood for purification. This prefigures the necessity of Christ's blood for the cleansing of sin, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, "without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."<p><b>over the fresh water</b><br>Fresh water, or living water, symbolizes life and purification. In <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>, Jesus refers to Himself as the source of living water, offering eternal life. The combination of blood and water in this ritual points to the dual aspects of Christ's sacrifice: cleansing and life-giving.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>, the priest plays a crucial role in the purification process for someone healed of a skin disease.
