The prohibition against such relationships underscores the importance of maintaining family purity and boundaries. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, family structures were central to societal stability, and violations of these boundaries were seen as threats to the social order. This command also reflects the broader biblical principle of honoring family relationships, as seen in the commandment to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p><b>You are not to marry her son&#8217;s daughter or her daughter&#8217;s daughter and have sexual relations with her.</b><br>This extension of the prohibition emphasizes the importance of generational boundaries within families. The inclusion of granddaughters in this command highlights the need to protect the innocence and integrity of younger family members. The Bible consistently upholds the sanctity of marriage and family, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman. This command also serves to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable family members, aligning with the biblical theme of justice and protection for the weak.<p><b>They are close relatives; it is depraved.</b><br>The term "close relatives" indicates the importance of maintaining clear distinctions within family relationships. The use of the word "depraved" suggests a moral corruption that goes against God's design for human relationships. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that calls for holiness and separation from practices that defile (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The New Testament echoes this call to purity, urging believers to flee from sexual immorality (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>). The emphasis on holiness and purity in relationships points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who calls His followers to live lives that reflect His righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom these laws were given to set them apart from other nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people practicing detestable customs that God wanted His people to avoid.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_family_relationships.htm">Sanctity of Family Relationships</a></b><br>God&#8217;s laws protect the integrity and sanctity of family relationships.

But though this prohibition is directed against a peculiar form of polygamy. there can hardly be any doubt that, as the administrators of the law during the second Temple interpreted it, if he married either of them and she died, he could not marry the other any more, and that this prohibition did not apply to cases of illicit commerce. Criminal intercourse with one did not preclude him from marrying the other. For contracting the kind of polygamy here forbidden, the offenders were punished with death by fire. (See <a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm" title="And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.">Leviticus 20:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The ninth form of incest prohibited is intercourse with a stepdaughter, or step-granddaughter, or mother-in-law.
