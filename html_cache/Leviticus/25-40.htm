The law emphasizes compassion and fairness, ensuring that the individual is not treated as a slave but as a hired worker or temporary resident. This reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and mercy, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>, which also discusses the release of Hebrew servants. The cultural context of ancient Israel was one where servitude was often a result of economic hardship, and this law provided a means for individuals to maintain dignity and hope for restoration.<p><b>he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.</b><br>The Year of Jubilee, occurring every 50th year, was a time of liberation and restoration, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8-17</a>. It was a unique institution in Israelite society, ensuring that land and people could return to their original state, preventing perpetual poverty and servitude. This concept underscores the biblical theme of redemption and foreshadows the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who proclaimed the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>), symbolizing spiritual freedom and restoration.

This echoes earlier commands: &#8220;If a stranger dwells with you in your land, you shall not mistreat him&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>).
