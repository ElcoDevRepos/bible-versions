In the context of the priesthood, it represents the need for holiness in those who serve God. The act of dressing Aaron signifies his consecration and readiness to serve as high priest. This parallels the New Testament call for believers to "put on" Christ (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>), emphasizing a life of holiness.<p><b>tied the sash around him</b><br>The sash, or girdle, was used to secure the tunic and represents service and readiness. In biblical times, girding oneself was a sign of preparation for work or battle. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are instructed to gird their loins with truth, highlighting the importance of being prepared and committed to God's service.<p><b>clothed him with the robe</b><br>The robe was a seamless garment worn over the tunic, signifying the dignity and authority of the high priest. It was often associated with royalty and priesthood, pointing to the honor and responsibility of Aaron's role. This foreshadows Christ, our High Priest, who is clothed in majesty and authority (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>).<p><b>and put the ephod on him</b><br>The ephod was a distinctive priestly garment, often associated with seeking God's will. It was made of fine materials and held the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, used for divine guidance. This highlights the role of the priest as an intermediary between God and the people, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus, who intercedes for us (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>He tied the woven band of the ephod around him</b><br>The woven band, or girdle, of the ephod was intricately designed, symbolizing the beauty and complexity of God's covenant with Israel. It served to secure the ephod, ensuring it stayed in place, much like the faithfulness required in the priestly office. This reflects the steadfastness of Christ's priesthood, which is unchanging and eternal (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><b>and fastened it to him</b><br>The act of fastening the ephod signifies the permanence and commitment of Aaron's role as high priest. It underscores the idea of being bound to one's duty and calling. This is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to remain steadfast in their faith and calling (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>), just as Christ was faithful to His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

It will be seen that the first article of dress--viz., the drawers--distinctly mentioned in <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm" title="And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:">Exodus 28:42</a>, is here omitted. This arises from the fact that, being nearest to the skin, Aaron put them on himself behind the curtain, immediately after his ablution.<p><span class= "bld">And girded him with the girdle.</span>--Not the band of the ephod, which is mentioned further on by the name of "curious girdle," but the one made of needlework, with which the tunic was girded about the loins. (See <a href="/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10</a>, and <a href="/exodus/28-39.htm" title="And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.">Exodus 28:39</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - The robing. The various articles of the priestly dress had been appointed and described before (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 29</a>). In these verses we see the order in which they were <span class="cmt_word">put on</span>. After the priests had, no doubt, changed their linen drawers, there came, first, <span class="cmt_word">the coat</span>, that is, a close-fitting tunic of white linen, made with sleeves and covering the whole body; <span class="cmt_word">next the girdle</span> of the tunic, that is, a linen sash for tying the tunic round the body, with variegated ends hanging on each side to the ankles; thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the robe</span>, that is, a blue vesture, woven of one piece, with holes for the head and arms to pass through, reaching from the neck to below the knee, the bottom being ornamented with blue, purple, and scarlet pomegranates, alternating with golden bells; fourthly, <span class="cmt_word">the ephod</span>, which consisted of two shoulder-pieces, or epaulettes, made of variegated linen and gold thread, fastened together in front and at the back by a narrow strap or band, from which hung, before and behind the wearer, two pieces of cloth confined below by <span class="cmt_word">the curious girdle of the ephod</span>, that is, by a sash made of the same material as the ephod itself. Into the ephod were sewn two onyxes, one on each shoulder, in gold filigree settings, one of them engraven with the names of half of the tribes, and the other with the remaining half; and from two rosettes or buttons by the side of these stones depended twisted gold chains for the support of the breastplate. Fifth came <span class="cmt_word">the breastplate</span>, which was a square pocket, made of embroidered linen, a span long and a span broad, worn upon the breast and hanging from the gold chains above mentioned, the lower ends of the gold chain being tied to two rings at the upper and outer corner of the breastplate, while the upper and inner corner of the same was attached to the ephod by blue thread running through two sets of rings in the breastplate and ephod respectively. The outer side of the breastplate was stiffened and adorned by twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three, each stone having on it the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate being double and the two sides and the bottom being sewn up, the pocket formed by it had its opening at the top. Into this pocket were placed <span class="cmt_word">the Urim and the Thummim</span>, which were probably two balls of different colours, one of which on being drawn out indicated the approval of God, and the other his disapproval, as to any point on which the high priest consulted him. (The Jewish tradition, that the Divine answer by the Urim and the Thummim came by a supernatural light thrown on certain letters in the names of the tribes, has no foundation.) The last part of the dress to be put on was <span class="cmt_word">the mitre</span>, or head-dress of linen, probably of the nature of a turban; to which, by a blue string, was attached <span class="cmt_word">the golden plate</span>, in such a way that it rested lengthwise on the forehead, and on this plate or <span class="cmt_word">holy crown</span> were inscribed the words," Holiness to the Lord." The investiture took place <span class="cmt_word">as the Lord commanded Moses</span>, that is, in accordance with the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. Its purpose and its meaning in the eyes of the people would have been twofold: first, after the manner of the king's crown and the judge's robe, it served to manifest the fact that the function of priest was committed to the wearer; and next, it symbolized the necessity of being clothed upon with the righteousness of God, in order to be able to act as interpreter and mediator between God and man, thus foreshadowing the Divine Nature of him who should be the Mediator in antitype. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
