In the context of the Old Testament, fire often symbolizes God's holiness and power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> with the burning bush and in <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a> with Elijah's sacrifice. The fire coming from the LORD indicates His acceptance of the offerings and His presence among the Israelites, affirming the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests.<p><b>and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar.</b><br>The consumption of the offering by divine fire demonstrates God's acceptance of the sacrifice. The burnt offering, a key element of the Levitical sacrificial system, symbolizes atonement and dedication to God. The fat portions, considered the best part of the animal, were reserved for God alone (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>And when all the people saw it,</b><br>The witnessing of this event by the entire assembly underscores the communal aspect of worship and the importance of public acknowledgment of God's presence and power. It serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility of the Israelites to uphold the covenant with God.<p><b>they shouted for joy</b><br>The people's reaction of joy reflects their recognition of God's favor and the successful inauguration of the priestly ministry. This joy is akin to the rejoicing seen in other biblical instances of divine intervention and blessing, such as the return of the Ark of the Covenant in <a href="/1_samuel/6-13.htm">1 Samuel 6:13</a>.<p><b>and fell facedown.</b><br>Falling facedown is an act of worship, reverence, and submission, acknowledging God's holiness and authority. This posture is seen throughout Scripture in moments of divine revelation or presence, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a> with Abraham and in <a href="/revelation/7-11.htm">Revelation 7:11</a> with the angels.

In this manner God afterwards testified His acceptance of the sacrifice of Gideon (<a href="/context/judges/6-20.htm" title="And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.

Tradition assures us that the sacred fire which thus issued forth from the immediate presence of God continued to be nourished on the altar with the fuel especially provided by the congregation, and constituted the perpetual fire.

They would have continued smouldering all the day and the night, but a miraculous fire issued from the tabernacle, and consumed the whole in the sight of the people. So fire fell and consumed Solomon's sacrifice at the dedication of the temple.
