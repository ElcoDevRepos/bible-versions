The prohibition against incestuous relationships is a recurring theme in the Bible, reflecting the need to uphold the sanctity of family structures. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such relationships were often taboo, and this command reinforces the distinctiveness of Israel's moral and ethical code. The command also serves to protect familial harmony and prevent the complications that arise from blurred family lines. This directive is consistent with the broader biblical principle of holiness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God calls His people to be holy as He is holy.<p><b>she is your father&#8217;s close relative.</b><br>The phrase highlights the closeness of the familial relationship, underscoring the importance of respecting family ties and boundaries. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family was the central social unit, and maintaining its integrity was crucial. This commandment reflects the broader biblical theme of honoring one's family, as seen in the commandment to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The emphasis on "close relative" also points to the potential for confusion and conflict that could arise from such relationships, which could disrupt the social and spiritual fabric of the community. This directive aligns with the New Testament teachings on sexual purity and the importance of treating others with respect and dignity, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom these laws were given, as they were being formed into a distinct nation with a unique identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people whose practices God wanted the Israelites to avoid.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/father's_sister.htm">Father&#8217;s Sister (Aunt)</a></b><br>The specific relative mentioned in this verse, highlighting the importance of maintaining family boundaries and respect.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_code.htm">Holiness Code</a></b><br>A section within Leviticus (chapters 17-26) that outlines laws intended to set the Israelites apart as holy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_boundaries.htm">Respect for Family Boundaries</a></b><br>This commandment underscores the importance of maintaining clear and respectful boundaries within the family unit.

God speaks in the imperative, leaving no room for negotiation or cultural adjustment.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently places sexual boundaries for the protection of individuals and the preservation of family integrity (see <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>, &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>, &#8220;Marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept undefiled&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By stating what must not occur, the Lord affirms what should occur&#8212;sexual intimacy reserved for the covenant of marriage between one man and one woman (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with your father&#8217;s sister</b><p>&#8226; The specific relationship identified is an aunt&#8212;someone who occupies both generational and relational authority in the family.<p>&#8226; Targeting this kinship line underscores that no matter the closeness in age or convenience, God forbids incestuous behavior.<p>&#8226; Parallel texts reinforce the point: <a href="/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a> warns, &#8220;You must not approach your mother&#8217;s sister or your father&#8217;s sister,&#8221; while <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a> pronounces a curse on similar violations.<p>&#8226; The New Testament shows the ongoing seriousness of incest: <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a> highlights a case of sexual immorality &#8220;not tolerated even among pagans,&#8221; illustrating that God&#8217;s standard has not shifted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she is your father&#8217;s close relative</b><p>&#8226; The phrase explains the reason behind the prohibition. The aunt shares the same bloodline as the father; sexual union would confuse roles designed by God.<p>&#8226; Family bonds are meant for nurture, not desire. Violating that boundary damages generational trust and distorts God&#8217;s created order (<a href="/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10&#8211;11</a> condemns those who &#8220;have uncovered the nakedness of their fathers&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By labeling her a &#8220;close relative,&#8221; the Lord highlights the sacredness of kin relationships. The same principle undergirds all the surrounding commands in <a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6</a>: &#8220;No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/18-12.htm">Leviticus 18:12</a> plainly forbids sexual relations with one&#8217;s aunt. The command protects family purity, honors God&#8217;s design for sexuality, and preserves clear relational roles across generations. Scripture presents these boundaries as timeless, calling God&#8217;s people to holiness in every era.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Thy father's sister.</span>--According to the law which obtained in the time of Christ this prohibition not only extended to the father's half-sisters, but even when they were begotten by the grandfather illegitimately. It is remarkable that Moses himself was the offspring of such an alliance, since his father Amram married his own aunt Jochebed, who was the sister of his father. (See <a href="/exodus/6-20.htm" title="And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.">Exodus 6:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - Fifthly, incest with a paternal or maternal aunt is forbidden; sixthly, with an aunt by marriage; seventhly, with a daughter-in-law.
