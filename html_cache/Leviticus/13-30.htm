Their role in examining infections highlights the integration of spiritual and physical well-being. This examination was crucial for maintaining the purity of the community, as outlined in the Mosaic Law. The priest's duty to inspect aligns with the broader biblical theme of discernment and judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/2-15.htm">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>, where spiritual discernment is emphasized.<p><b>and if it appears to be deeper than the skin</b><br>This phrase indicates a thorough examination to determine the severity of the infection. Infections that penetrated deeper than the skin were considered more serious, symbolizing sin's deeper impact on the soul. This concept is echoed in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their superficial righteousness, emphasizing the importance of inner purity.<p><b>and the hair in it is yellow and thin</b><br>The description of yellow and thin hair is specific to certain skin diseases, possibly indicating conditions like psoriasis or fungal infections. The color and texture of the hair were diagnostic criteria, reflecting the detailed nature of Levitical law. This attention to detail underscores the importance of holiness and purity in every aspect of life, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which calls believers to be holy in all conduct.<p><b>the priest must pronounce him unclean</b><br>The declaration of uncleanness had significant social and religious implications. Being pronounced unclean meant isolation from the community and exclusion from worship, symbolizing the separation sin causes between individuals and God. This mirrors the spiritual separation described in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where iniquities create a barrier between people and God.<p><b>it is a scaly outbreak, an infectious disease of the head or chin</b><br>The specific mention of a scaly outbreak on the head or chin suggests a visible and potentially contagious condition. In the biblical context, such diseases were often seen as physical manifestations of spiritual impurity. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where physical ailments sometimes symbolize spiritual conditions, as seen in <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-3</a>, where Jesus heals a man born blind to demonstrate spiritual truths.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests served as mediators between God and the people, and they were responsible for diagnosing and declaring skin diseases, including leprosy, as clean or unclean.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_infected_person.htm">The Infected Person</a></b><br>This refers to any individual who shows symptoms of a skin disease, specifically a scaly outbreak on the head or chin, which the priest must examine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_examination.htm">The Examination</a></b><br>A process conducted by the priest to determine the nature of the skin condition, focusing on whether it is deeper than the skin and if the hair is yellow and thin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/leprosy.htm">Leprosy</a></b><br>A term used in the Bible to describe various skin diseases, not necessarily the modern understanding of Hansen's disease, but any condition that made a person ceremonially unclean.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the tabernacle was the central place of worship where the priests served and where the laws of cleanliness were particularly relevant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's role in diagnosing skin diseases underscores the importance of spiritual leadership in guiding and maintaining the community's purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_implications_of_physical_conditions.htm">Spiritual Implications of Physical Conditions</a></b><br>Physical ailments in the Old Testament often had spiritual implications, reminding us of the pervasive nature of sin and the need for purification.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_isolation.htm">Community and Isolation</a></b><br>The declaration of uncleanness led to isolation, reflecting the impact of sin on community relationships and the need for restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>God's laws concerning cleanliness highlight His desire for His people to be holy and set apart, both physically and spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_ultimate_healer.htm">Christ as the Ultimate Healer</a></b><br>In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the law by providing ultimate healing and cleansing, offering a way to be spiritually clean before God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_13_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 13:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_13_30_s_spiritual_relevance.htm">How does Leviticus 13:30 emphasize the importance of spiritual cleanliness today?

Scripture often uses &#8220;deeper&#8221; language to expose what lies beneath appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Physically, a deep infection could spread; spiritually, it hints that sin likewise works below the surface unless brought to light (<a href="/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the hair in it is yellow and thin</b><p>Distinctive color and texture helped priests diagnose contagious scalp ailments, probably forms of ringworm or favus.

While the priest&#8217;s verdict of &#8220;unclean&#8221; separates the sufferer for a time, it also safeguards others and opens the door to eventual restoration, prefiguring Christ&#8217;s redemptive work that cleanses sin and brings the outcast back into fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Behold, if it be in sight deeper.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Behold, if its appearance is deeper. </span>The first symptom of its existence is the same as usual--the depression of the affected spot.<p><span class= "bld">And there be in it a yellow thin hair.</span>--Whilst the symptom of leprosy in other parts of the body consisted of the hair turning white on the affected spot, in the case of this distemper breaking out on the head or chin it was indicated by the naturally black hair changing its colour into a golden appearance, and becoming short. According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, the colour of the hair became like that of the new plumage of young pigeons after they have lost their first feathers, or, in other words, like the appearance of thin gold. By the "thin hair" those authorities who came in contact with the disorder understand <span class= "ital">small </span>or <span class= "ital">short </span>hair. Hence they laid down the following rule: The condition of the hair constituting one of the signs of leprosy is its becoming short; but if it be long, though it is as yellow as gold, it is no sign of uncleanness. Two yellow and short hairs, whether close to one another or far from each other, whether in the centre of the affected spot or on the edge thereof,--no matter whether the affection on the spot precedes the yellow hair, or the yellow hair precedes the affection on the spot,--are symptoms of uncleanness.<p><span class= "bld">It is a dry scall, even a leprosy.</span>--The ancient canons laid down by those authorities in the time of Christ who had the official treatment of this distemper define the word (<span class= "ital">nethek</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which is translated "dry scall" by an affection on the head or chin, which causes the hair on those affected parts to fall off by the roots, so that the place of the hair is quite bare.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1436;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
