The congregation of Israel refers to the entire community, emphasizing that the Day of Atonement was a national event. The high priest acted on behalf of all the people, highlighting the collective responsibility for sin. This communal approach is seen throughout the Old Testament, where the actions of individuals often had implications for the entire community (e.g., <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1-26</a>).<p><b>two male goats for a sin offering</b><br>The two male goats are central to the ritual of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. One goat was sacrificed as a sin offering, symbolizing the payment for the people's sins. The other, known as the scapegoat, was sent into the wilderness, symbolically carrying away the sins of Israel (<a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>). This dual aspect of atonement&#8212;sacrifice and removal of sin&#8212;foreshadows the work of Jesus Christ, who both paid the penalty for sin and removed it from believers (<a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>).<p><b>and one ram for a burnt offering</b><br>The ram for a burnt offering signifies complete dedication and consecration to God. Unlike the sin offering, which dealt with atonement, the burnt offering was entirely consumed by fire, representing total surrender and devotion. This offering underscores the need for holiness and commitment to God following the cleansing from sin. The burnt offering is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the sacrifices of Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>) and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), and it points to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest who performs the atonement rituals on the Day of Atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_the_israelites.htm">The Congregation of the Israelites</a></b><br>The community of Israel from whom the offerings are taken.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_male_goats.htm">Two Male Goats</a></b><br>Used for the sin offering, one of which is sacrificed, and the other is sent into the wilderness as the scapegoat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/one_ram.htm">One Ram</a></b><br>Used for the burnt offering, symbolizing complete dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_atonement.htm">The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A significant annual event for the Israelites, focusing on atonement and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The need for a sin offering highlights the gravity of sin and the necessity of atonement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/substitutionary_atonement.htm">Substitutionary Atonement</a></b><br>The two goats represent the concept of substitution, where one bears the sin and the other carries it away, prefiguring Christ's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The offerings are taken from the congregation, emphasizing communal involvement in atonement and worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/complete_dedication.htm">Complete Dedication</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes total surrender and dedication to God, a call for believers to offer themselves wholly to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_fulfillment.htm">Christ as Fulfillment</a></b><br>Jesus fulfills the roles of both the sin offering and the scapegoat, providing complete atonement for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_16_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 16:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_2_goats_in_Lev_16_5.htm">What is the significance of "two male goats" for the sin offering in Leviticus 16:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_16_5_and_Christ_s_atonement.htm">How does Leviticus 16:5 foreshadow Christ's atoning sacrifice for our sins?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Importance_of_communal_atonement.htm">Why is communal atonement important in Leviticus 16:5, and how can we apply it?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_16_5_Hebrews_9_12-14_link.htm">How does Leviticus 16:5 connect with Hebrews 9:12-14 regarding Christ's sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_16_5_s_lessons_on_repentance.htm">What lessons from Leviticus 16:5 can guide our understanding of repentance today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_two_goats_important_in_Lev_16_5.htm">What is the significance of the two male goats in Leviticus 16:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_16_5_s_link_to_atonement.htm">How does Leviticus 16:5 relate to the concept of atonement in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_goats_for_sin_offering_in_Lev_16_5.htm">Why were goats chosen for the sin offering in Leviticus 16:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_are_paul_and_timothy_in_the_bible.htm">Is Jesus superior to Levitical sacrifices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_a_trespass_offering.htm">What is a trespass offering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_'lamb_of_god'_fit_ot_laws.htm">How does calling Jesus 'the Lamb of God' who removes sin (John 1:29) fit with conflicting Old Testament sacrificial laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_amos_5_25_deny_wilderness_sacrifices.htm">Amos 5:25 -

Obedience precedes atonement, foreshadowing Christ who said, &#8220;I have come to do Your will, O God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>). The initiative is divine, not human (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the congregation of Israel</b><p>The animals come from the people themselves, making clear that the sacrifice represents them.

Once sin is dealt with, worshipers may offer themselves completely; Paul echoes this pattern: &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).

By supplying the animals, the congregation acknowledges responsibility; by accepting them, God offers mercy. The verse anticipates Jesus&#8217; perfect work&#8212;both the sin-bearing substitute and the means of wholehearted reconciliation&#8212;so that forgiven people may live in devoted fellowship with their holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And he shall take of the congregation.</span>--On this occasion the high priest himself had to officiate, by virtue of his being the chief mediator between God and His people.<p><span class= "bld">Two kids of the goats.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">two shaggy he-goats. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm" title="Or if his sin, wherein he has sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:">Leviticus 4:23</a>.) These two goats, which were the sin offering for the people, and the ram, which was their burnt offering, were purchased with the money of the public some time before the Day of Atonement. During the second Temple the two goats had to be alike in value, equal in size, and of the same colour. If one of them happened to die after the decision of the lot, a new pair had to be purchased, and the surviving one of the original pair was kept and properly fed till it became ritually defective, whereupon it was sold, and the money paid into the sacred treasury.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats.</span> It was necessary that the sacrifice offered for a person or class of persons should be provided by the offerer or offerers.
