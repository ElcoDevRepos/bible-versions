A freewill offering, on the other hand, is given voluntarily, without obligation, as an act of worship and thanksgiving. These offerings reflect the heart of the worshiper and their relationship with God. The concept of vows is seen throughout the Bible, such as in Hannah's vow in <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>. Freewill offerings emphasize the voluntary nature of worship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>, where the Israelites willingly contributed to the construction of the Tabernacle.<p><b>it shall be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice</b><br>The immediate consumption of the sacrifice underscores the importance of the offering being fresh and untainted, symbolizing purity and holiness. This practice also highlights the communal aspect of worship, as the meal would often be shared with family and friends, fostering fellowship. The immediacy of consumption can be seen as a reflection of the urgency and sincerity in one's devotion to God, paralleling the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8-10</a>, which was also to be eaten promptly.<p><b>but the remainder may be eaten on the next day</b><br>Allowing the remainder to be eaten the following day provides practical flexibility while maintaining the sanctity of the offering. This provision ensures that the sacrifice is not wasted, reflecting God's provision and care for His people. It also emphasizes the temporal nature of the offering, as anything left beyond the second day was to be burned, as stated in <a href="/leviticus/7-17.htm">Leviticus 7:17</a>. This regulation ensures that the offering remains a holy act, preventing decay or corruption, which could symbolize sin. The two-day limit can be seen as a type of Christ, who was in the grave for two days and rose on the third, signifying the completion and perfection of His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the instructions for sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The individuals responsible for performing the sacrifices and ensuring the laws were followed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices were offered, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>The offerings made by the Israelites, including vow and freewill offerings, as acts of worship and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrificial_intent.htm">Understanding Sacrificial Intent</a></b><br>Recognize the difference between vow offerings and freewill offerings.

The distinction between them, as defined by the canon law, which obtained in the time of Christ, is as follows :--A vow (<span class= "ital">n?d?r</span>) is an obligation voluntarily imposed upon oneself with the formula, "Behold, I take it upon myself to bring a bullock, &c., for a peace offering." This undertaking is binding upon the person till he fulfils it. Hence, if the bullock in question dies, or is stolen, or becomes disqualified for a sacrifice, he must bring another. A free-will offering (<span class= "ital">nedabah</span>) simply pledges voluntarily a certain animal for a peace offering, with the formula, " Behold, this animal I devote for a peace offering." Hence, if the animal in question dies, or is stolen, or has otherwise become disqualified for sacrifice, the obligation ceases, since it does not extend beyond the animal thus devoted.<p><span class= "bld">It shall be eaten the same day.</span>--As both these votive offerings were an indirect mode of supplication having respect to future favours, and hence were not a spontaneous expression of pious devotion, they were not so sacred as the former. They were, therefore, allowed to be eaten both on the day of presentation and on the following day.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/7-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
