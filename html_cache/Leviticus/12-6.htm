According to Levitical law, this period lasted 40 days for a male child and 80 days for a female child. The purification process underscores the importance of ritual cleanliness in maintaining a relationship with God, reflecting the holiness required by the covenant community.<p><b>whether for a son or for a daughter</b><br>The distinction in the length of purification for a son versus a daughter highlights the cultural and religious practices of ancient Israel. The longer period for a daughter may reflect societal views on gender roles and the perceived need for greater purification. This distinction is unique to the Old Testament and is not carried into New Testament teachings.<p><b>she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. Bringing offerings to the priest at this location signifies the importance of approaching God through His appointed means and mediators, foreshadowing the role of Christ as the ultimate High Priest.<p><b>a year-old lamb for a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, atonement, and commitment to God. The requirement of a year-old lamb, a symbol of innocence and purity, points to the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. This offering represents total surrender and devotion to God.<p><b>and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was mandatory and served to atone for unintentional sins and cleanse from ceremonial uncleanness. The provision for a pigeon or turtledove, less costly than a lamb, demonstrates God's accommodation for the poor, ensuring that all could participate in the sacrificial system. This offering prefigures Christ's atonement, emphasizing His role in cleansing humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>- The individual responsible for offering sacrifices and performing rituals as outlined in the Levitical law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>- Refers to a mother who has given birth and is required to bring a sacrifice for purification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The sacred place where sacrifices and offerings were made, representing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burnt_offering_and_sin_offering.htm">The Burnt Offering and Sin Offering</a></b><br>- Specific types of sacrifices required for purification and atonement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_purification.htm">Understanding Purification</a></b><br>The requirement for a purification offering highlights the holiness of God and the need for cleansing from impurity.

This burnt offering was an expression of gratitude for the Divine mercy vouchsafed to her in the hours of sorrow and danger, or, as some ancients suggest, it was designed as a confession of impatient and reproachful thoughts harboured by the mother during her pregnancy and the time of parturition (comp. <a href="/genesis/25-22.htm" title="And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.">Genesis 25:22</a>); whilst the sin offering was to atone for sinful and violent expressions which she may have heedlessly uttered in the hours of labour and agony. Though when the two sacrifices are mentioned together, the sin offering generally precedes the burnt offering (see <a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm" title="And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he has committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-31.htm" title="Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.">Leviticus 14:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-15.htm" title="And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.">Leviticus 15:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-30.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.">Leviticus 15:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-5.htm" title="And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:5</a>, &c.), here the burnt offering takes precedence, because it is the more costly of the two. Besides the mother after child-birth (<a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm" title="And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest:">Leviticus 12:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm" title="And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.">Leviticus 12:8</a>), there were three other unclean persons who had to bring a sin offering for their uncleanness: the leper (<a href="/leviticus/14-19.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:">Leviticus 14:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-31.htm" title="Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.">Leviticus 14:31</a>), the woman that had an issue (<a href="/leviticus/15-15.htm" title="And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.">Leviticus 15:15</a>), and the man that had an issue (<a href="/leviticus/15-30.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.">Leviticus 15:30</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - The previous verses having stated the conditions and the term of continuance of the uncleanness arising from childbirth, the three final verses describe the offerings to be made by the woman for her purification. <span class="cmt_word">She shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering.</span> Two things are noticeable here: first, that the burnt offering, symbolizing self-devotion, is far more costly and important than the sin offering, which had not to be offered for any individual personal sin, but only for human sin, "which had been indirectly manifested in her bodily condition" (Keil); and secondly, that in this one case the sin offering appears to succeed the burnt offering instead of preceding it. No doubt the changed order is owing to the cause just mentioned; the idea of sin, though it may not be altogether put aside (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>), is not to be prominent, as though it were peculiar to the special woman who was purified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of her purification</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;&#183;ho&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
