This act of coming forward signifies obedience to Moses' command and a willingness to serve in a difficult situation. It highlights the importance of following divine instructions, even when the task is unpleasant or challenging.<p><b>and carried them</b><br>The act of carrying Nadab and Abihu's bodies indicates the seriousness of their offense and the immediate need to remove the impurity from the holy area. In ancient Israelite culture, touching a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean, yet this task was necessary to maintain the sanctity of the tabernacle. This reflects the gravity of sin and its consequences, as well as the need for purification and separation from sin.<p><b>still in their tunics</b><br>The mention of the tunics emphasizes that Nadab and Abihu were still in their priestly garments when they died. This detail underscores the abruptness of their judgment and serves as a reminder of the holiness required of those who serve before God. The tunics, part of the priestly attire, symbolize their consecration and the expectation of purity and obedience in their service.<p><b>outside the camp</b><br>Removing the bodies outside the camp signifies the removal of impurity from the community. In the Israelite camp, the presence of God dwelled in the tabernacle, and anything unclean had to be taken outside to preserve the holiness of the camp. This act foreshadows the concept of Jesus Christ being crucified outside the city, bearing the sins of the world and taking impurity upon Himself to sanctify believers.<p><b>as Moses had directed</b><br>This phrase highlights Moses' role as the mediator between God and the people, ensuring that God's commands are followed precisely. It reflects the importance of leadership and obedience in maintaining the covenant relationship with God. Moses' direction is a reminder of the need for adherence to divine instructions and the consequences of deviating from them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments.
