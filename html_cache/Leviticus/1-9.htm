This act reflects the need for cleanliness and holiness before God, as seen in other purification rituals throughout Leviticus. The washing signifies the internal and external purity required of the offering, pointing to the holiness God demands from His people. This practice also foreshadows the cleansing work of Jesus Christ, who purifies believers from sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><b>and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar</b><br>The complete burning of the offering signifies total dedication and surrender to God. The priest acts as a mediator between the people and God, highlighting the role of Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The altar, central to the tabernacle and later the temple, represents the place where God meets with His people. The act of burning the entire offering underscores the concept of atonement and the seriousness of sin, requiring a complete sacrifice.<p><b>as a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, is one of the oldest and most significant offerings, symbolizing atonement and reconciliation with God. It is entirely consumed by fire, representing the worshiper's total devotion and the complete acceptance of the offering by God. This offering prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice, who offered Himself wholly to God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>a food offering</b><br>Though not consumed by the priests or worshipers, the burnt offering is described as a "food offering" to God, indicating that it is a gift or tribute to the Lord. This terminology emphasizes the relational aspect of the sacrifice, as it is presented to God as an act of worship and fellowship. It reflects the idea that God is pleased with the offerings of His people when given with a sincere heart.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" signifies God's acceptance and satisfaction with the offering. It is a metaphorical expression indicating that the sacrifice is agreeable to God, aligning with His will and purposes. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The pleasing aroma underscores the idea that true worship and obedience are delightful to the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals, acting as a mediator between God and the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The sacred place where offerings are made to God, symbolizing His presence and the place of atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in which the entire animal is consumed by fire, symbolizing complete surrender and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/entrails_and_legs.htm">Entrails and Legs</a></b><br>Parts of the sacrificial animal that are specifically mentioned to be washed, indicating the importance of purity and preparation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pleasing_aroma.htm">Pleasing Aroma</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating that the offering is acceptable and pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/complete_dedication_to_god.htm">Complete Dedication to God</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes total surrender to God.

The vapour that ascends is not something different from that which is burnt, but the very thing itself, its essence; which, having ascended, is of a <span class="cmt_word">sweet savour unto the Lord</span>, that is, acceptable and well-pleasing to him. The burnt offering, the meat offering, and the peace offering, are sacrifices of sweet savour (<a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>); the expression is not used with regard to the sin offering and trespass offering. St. Paul applies it to the sacrifice of Christ, in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, "As Christ also loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour;" thus indicating, in an incidental manner, the connection between the Jewish sacrifices and the sacrifice of Christ, as type and antitype. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The entrails</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qir&#183;b&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
