The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was a sacred space where God's presence dwelled, and only designated individuals, such as the high priest, could enter at specific times. This restriction highlights the holiness required to approach God and the separation between the divine and the common.<p><b>from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement</b><br>Aaron, the first high priest, was the only one permitted to enter the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This annual event was crucial for the spiritual cleansing of the people. The act of making atonement involved rituals and sacrifices that symbolized the removal of sin and reconciliation with God. Aaron's role as mediator foreshadows the ultimate high priest, Jesus Christ, who makes atonement for humanity.<p><b>in the Most Holy Place</b><br>The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, was the innermost and most sacred area of the Tabernacle, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. It represented God's throne on earth and was separated by a veil. Only the high priest could enter this space, and only once a year, signifying the barrier between God and humanity due to sin. The tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) symbolizes the removal of this barrier.<p><b>until he leaves</b><br>The high priest's time in the Most Holy Place was limited, emphasizing the temporary nature of the Old Covenant sacrifices. This contrasts with the eternal atonement made by Christ, who, after offering Himself, sat down at the right hand of God (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>), signifying the completion and sufficiency of His sacrifice.<p><b>after he has made atonement for himself, his household,</b><br>Before making atonement for the people, Aaron had to offer sacrifices for his own sins and those of his household. This requirement highlights the imperfection of the earthly priesthood and the need for a sinless mediator. Jesus, as the sinless high priest, did not need to offer sacrifices for Himself, making His atonement perfect and complete (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>).<p><b>and the whole assembly of Israel.</b><br>The Day of Atonement was a communal event, emphasizing the collective need for forgiveness and purification. It foreshadows the universal scope of Christ's atonement, which is available to all who believe, transcending the boundaries of Israel to include all nations (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>).

His solitary service, begun and concluded without interruption, secured cleansing first for himself and his household and then for the entire nation. The verse magnifies God&#8217;s holiness, humanity&#8217;s need for a mediator, and the completeness of accepted atonement&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who entered the true sanctuary once for all and opened the way for every believer to draw near.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And there shall be no man.</span>--Whilst the high priest was performing this process of cleansing, no one, whether priest or Israelite, was permitted to be present, thus precluding the possibility of anyone being within the precincts who had unwittingly contracted defilement. The fact that the high priest was thus alone in the sanctuary, with no one to see how he conducted the ritual, gave rise to the practice of his being sworn, on the eve of the Day of Atonement, by the chief priests and the elders of the Sanhedrin that he would make no change whatever in the traditional ceremonies of the day, as follows :--"We adjure thee, by Him who hath caused His name to dwell in this house, that thou shalt not alter anything of all that we do say unto thee." This had especial reference to the points at issue between the Pharisees and Sadducees, as some of the high priests held the Sadducaic views. (See <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> From the first entry until the work of atonement was completed, both for the holy of holies and for the tabernacle, no one but the high priest was to be allowed within the door of the tabernacle, not only that there might be no witness of the withdrawal of the awful vail, but also that the rite of purification might not be interfered with by an impure presence. Even on the Day of Atonement the dwelling-place of God, typical of heaven, was closed to the eye and foot of man, "the way into the holiest of all being not yet made manifest" (<a href="/hebrews/9-8.htm">Hebrews 9:8</a>), until the Divine High Priest opened the way for his people by his own entrance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
