Blood symbolized life and atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The blood of certain offerings, such as the sin offering, was to be brought into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil or on the altar of incense (<a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>). This specific instruction highlights the gravity of the priests' role in mediating between God and the people. The failure to bring the blood inside the holy place in this instance indicates a deviation from the prescribed ritual, which was crucial for maintaining the sanctity and order of worship.<p><b>you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area</b><br>The consumption of the sin offering by the priests was a significant part of the atonement process (<a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>). Eating the offering in the sanctuary area signified the priests' participation in the people's atonement and their role in bearing the iniquity of the congregation (<a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). This act also reinforced the holiness required of the priests, as they were to consume the offering in a holy place, emphasizing their consecration and the sacredness of their duties.<p><b>as I commanded.</b><br>God's commands regarding the sacrificial system were detailed and specific, reflecting His holiness and the need for order in worship. The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions, as deviation could lead to severe consequences, as seen earlier in the chapter with Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). This command also points to the broader biblical theme of obedience as a demonstration of faith and reverence for God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).

In the aftermath, Eleazar and Ithamar present a sin offering for the people (10:16-17). Moses looks for the meat that should have been eaten and instead finds it burned. He says: &#8220;Since its blood was not brought inside the holy place&#8230;&#8221; (10:18).<p>&#8226; Two kinds of sin offerings exist in the Law:<p>&#8211; Blood carried into the Holy Place (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5-7</a>; 16:27; cf. <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11</a>). Those animals are entirely burned outside the camp; the priests never eat them.<p>&#8211; Blood applied only to the bronze altar in the courtyard (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25-30</a>). Those animals are holy food for the priests.<p>&#8226; Because the blood of this particular goat never entered the Holy Place, it belonged to the second category. Moses is simply stating the classification and reminding the priests of God&#8217;s clear pattern (<a href="/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area</b><p>The meat of a courtyard-only sin offering was to be eaten &#8220;in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26-27</a>). Eating it:<p>&#8226; Signified the priest sharing in the atonement he had facilitated for the people (<a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Confirmed the holiness of the offering; consuming it anywhere else would treat it as common (<a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Affirmed the priest&#8217;s dependence on God&#8217;s provision, since this food was part of their appointed portion (<a href="/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9-10</a>).<p>Aaron&#8217;s remaining sons, still reeling from their brothers&#8217; deaths, had chosen to burn the meat instead (<a href="/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a>). Moses&#8217; rebuke calls them back to their duty even in grief, highlighting how sacred service must not yield to personal emotion (cf. <a href="/matthew/8-21.htm">Matthew 8:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as I commanded</b><p>Moses&#8217; instructions were God&#8217;s own words (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>), so failing to eat the offering was disobedience to the Lord Himself. Scripture consistently links worship with precise obedience:<p>&#8226; &#8220;You must keep the LORD&#8217;s charge, so that you will not die&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/8-35.htm">Leviticus 8:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s later failure illustrates the same principle: &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes it: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>Even so, God is not indifferent to human weakness. Aaron explains in verse 19 that he feared eating while mourning might dishonor the ritual, and &#8220;Moses heard this and was satisfied&#8221; (10:20). The Law was upheld, yet mercy tempered judgment&#8212;foreshadowing the greater High Priest who &#8220;sympathizes with our weaknesses&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/10-18.htm">Leviticus 10:18</a> underscores that sin offerings whose blood stays outside the Holy Place must be eaten by the priests within the sanctuary courtyard. Eating the meat:<p>&#8226; Completes the atonement ritual.<p>&#8226; Sets the offering apart as holy.<p>&#8226; Models obedient, reverent service.<p>Moses&#8217; correction teaches that even amid sorrow God&#8217;s commands remain non-negotiable, yet His heart remains compassionate toward those who seek to honor Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Behold, the blood of it.</span>--According to the sacrificial law, the flesh of the sin offerings (<span class= "ital">the </span>blood of which was not carried into the sanctuary) had to be eaten by the priests alone, in a holy place, as a part of the expiatory rites. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25-26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm" title="Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?">Leviticus 10:17</a>.) It was the flesh of those sin offerings, the blood of which was carried into the sanctuary, which had to be burnt. (See <a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-16.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-23.htm" title="For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.">Leviticus 6:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-30.htm" title="And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile with in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.">Leviticus 6:30</a>.) Now the blood of the people's sin-offering which was offered on this occasion was not carried into the sanctuary.
