Skin diseases, often translated as "leprosy," encompass a variety of skin conditions. In ancient Israel, these conditions rendered a person ceremonially unclean, impacting their ability to participate in community and worship. The law provided a means for restoration and reintegration into society. This reflects God's concern for both physical and spiritual purity among His people.<p><b>on the day of his cleansing</b><br>The "day of his cleansing" signifies a pivotal moment for the afflicted individual. It marks the transition from impurity to purity, from exclusion to inclusion. This cleansing process is not merely physical but also spiritual, symbolizing forgiveness and restoration. The day of cleansing foreshadows the ultimate cleansing from sin through Jesus Christ, who heals and restores believers.<p><b>when he is brought to the priest</b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate High Priest. The involvement of the priest underscores the importance of divine authority in the process of cleansing. The priest's examination and declaration of cleanliness are essential for the individual's reintegration into the community.

Scripture consistently links law and life&#8212;see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>, &#8220;these are not idle words for you&#8212;they are your life.&#8221; The verse reminds us that divine instruction is never arbitrary but always aimed at holiness and wholeness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the one afflicted with a skin disease</b><p>&#8226; The focus is the person, not merely the condition. God notices the sufferer and provides a path back to community. Compare <a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>, where God&#8217;s blessing rests on individuals; likewise, <a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a> shows His heart to &#8220;heal the brokenhearted.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>, the diseased person was isolated. Here the Lord shows that isolation is not permanent; He plans for reintegration.<p>&#8226; The physical ailment pictures sin&#8217;s deeper defilement. <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a> portrays Israel&#8217;s sin as sores from head to toe, underscoring that only God can cleanse both body and soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the day of his cleansing</b><p>&#8226; A specific day underscores that cleansing is an event, not a vague hope. God appoints times&#8212;compare <a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a> (Passover) and <a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a> (the finished work of Christ).<p>&#8226; The leper&#8217;s &#8220;day&#8221; foreshadows our moment of salvation; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a> says, &#8220;Now is the day of salvation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse anticipates the elaborate ritual in <a href="/leviticus/14-3.htm">Leviticus 14:3-32</a>, showing that God&#8217;s cleansing involves both blood and water, themes fulfilled in <a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he is brought to the priest</b><p>&#8226; The initiative often comes from the community or family; the healed person does not stay hidden. In <a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>, ten lepers were told by Jesus, &#8220;Go, show yourselves to the priests,&#8221; echoing this command.<p>&#8226; The priest serves as God&#8217;s authorized witness. <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a> explains that every high priest is appointed to act on behalf of men in things pertaining to God.<p>&#8226; Certification by the priest restores social and worship privileges, just as <a href="/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a> records Jesus directing a healed leper to offer the gift Moses commanded &#8220;as a testimony.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a> means that God graciously provides a precise, authoritative pathway for a ritually defiled person to be declared clean and fully restored. The verse emphasizes that the standard is God&#8217;s law, the subject is the afflicted individual, cleansing occurs at God-appointed time, and validation comes through God&#8217;s ordained mediator. In doing so, it highlights the Lord&#8217;s concern for both holiness and compassionate restoration, pointing ultimately to Christ, our Great High Priest, who cleanses and welcomes believers back into fellowship with God and His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">This shall be the law of the leper.</span>--That is, the manner in which an Israelite cured of his leprosy shall be purified and restored to the communion of the sanctuary on the day when he is pronounced clean.<p><span class= "bld">He shall be brought unto the priest.</span>--He is to be conducted from his place of seclusion (see <a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm" title="All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.">Leviticus 13:46</a>) to an appointed place on the borders of the camp.
