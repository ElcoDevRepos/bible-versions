In the ancient Near Eastern context, marriage was a covenantal relationship, and adultery was seen as a violation of this sacred bond. The commandment against adultery is also found in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>), highlighting its importance in maintaining the moral and social fabric of the community. Adultery was considered not only a personal sin but also a communal offense that could bring judgment upon the nation.<p><b>with the wife of his neighbor</b><br>The term "neighbor" in this context refers to a fellow member of the Israelite community. The use of "neighbor" emphasizes the close-knit nature of the society and the expectation of mutual respect and trust among its members. This phrase underscores the betrayal involved in adultery, as it violates the trust between individuals who are part of the same community. The concept of loving one's neighbor is central to biblical teaching, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, and adultery is a direct contradiction to this principle.<p><b>both the adulterer and the adulteress</b><br>The law applies equally to both parties involved in the act of adultery, reflecting the biblical principle of justice and accountability. This equal treatment contrasts with some ancient cultures where women might have been more severely punished than men for similar offenses. The inclusion of both the adulterer and the adulteress highlights the seriousness of the sin and the need for both parties to be held responsible for their actions.<p><b>must surely be put to death</b><br>The prescribed penalty for adultery is death, indicating the gravity of the offense in the eyes of God. This severe punishment served as a deterrent to prevent the breakdown of family and societal structures. The death penalty for adultery is also mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>, reinforcing its importance in maintaining the holiness and purity of the community. While the New Testament does not prescribe the death penalty for adultery, it continues to affirm the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>) and calls for repentance and forgiveness (<a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3-11</a>).

The seventh commandment makes the prohibition clear: &#8220;You shall not commit adultery&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). Jesus deepens the issue to the level of the heart, warning that even lustful intent violates God&#8217;s standard (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>). In Scripture, adultery consistently pictures spiritual infidelity as well (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>; <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>), underscoring how seriously God views any betrayal of covenant love.<p>Key reminders:<p>&#8226; Marriage mirrors God&#8217;s faithful relationship with His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Adultery erodes personal integrity and community trust (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32-35</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s command is protective, not merely restrictive (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with another man&#8217;s wife</b><p>The phrase highlights that the woman already belongs to a covenant union.
