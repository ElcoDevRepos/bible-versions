This method ensured that the decision was not influenced by human bias but was seen as divinely guided. The use of lots is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the selection of Matthias as an apostle in <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>. The two goats were central to the Day of Atonement, a significant annual event for Israel, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>one for the LORD</b><br>The goat designated for the LORD was to be sacrificed as a sin offering. This act symbolized the need for blood to atone for sin, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament sacrificial system. The shedding of blood was necessary for the forgiveness of sins, as stated in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>. This goat represents the substitutionary atonement, pointing forward to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>and the other for the scapegoat</b><br>The term "scapegoat" comes from the Hebrew word "Azazel," which has been interpreted in various ways, including as a reference to a wilderness demon or as a symbolic representation of the removal of sin. The scapegoat was sent into the wilderness, symbolically carrying the sins of the people away from the camp. This act illustrates the concept of expiation, where sin is not only forgiven but also removed. This foreshadows the work of Christ, who not only forgives sin but also removes it from us, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes our transgressions as far as the east is from the west.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest who performs the ritual of casting lots for the two goats as part of the Day of Atonement ceremony.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_goats.htm">Two Goats</a></b><br>Central to the ritual, one goat is designated for the LORD and the other as the scapegoat (Azazel).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The recipient of the sacrificial goat, symbolizing atonement for the people's sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/scapegoat.htm">Scapegoat (Azazel)</a></b><br>The goat that is sent into the wilderness, symbolically carrying away the sins of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A significant annual event in the Israelite calendar for the atonement of sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The ritual of the two goats illustrates the dual aspects of atonement&#8212;sacrifice and removal of sin.

Together they point to Jesus Christ, whose death and victorious bearing away of sin accomplish the total, God-ordained redemption the Day of Atonement only previewed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Aaron shall cast lots.</span>--The lots consisted of two small tablets which at an earlier time were of box or ebony wood, but which during the later part of the second Temple were made of gold, and were kept in a wooden chest. On the one was engraved the words "For Jehovah," and on the other "For Azazel," the expression in the original, which is translated <span class= "ital">scapegoat </span>in the Authorised Version. The high priest, after shaking the chest, put both his hands into the urn and simultaneously took out the two tablets, one in each hand. Hereupon he put the tablet which he had in his right hand upon the goat that was standing on his right side, whilst the tablet in his left hand he put on the goat on his left side. If the tablet with the in scription "For Jehovah was in his right hand the chief priest who stood at the right of the pontiff exclaimed "Hold up thy right hand on high!" and if it happened to be in the left hand, the chief of the principal household, who stood on his left, called out to him "Hold up thy left hand." Hereupon the high priest laid the two lots on the two goats, the one in the right hand on the goat at his right, and the one in the left hand on the animal at his left, exclaiming at the same time, "To the Lord a sin offering!"<p><span class= "bld">And the other lot for the scapegoat.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and the other lot for Azazel. </span>The word, which only occurs in this chapter, probably denotes the utterly banished demon, the prince of the evil spirits, who with his legions occupies the desert regions and desolated places. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm" title="The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43</a>; <a href="/luke/11-24.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he said, I will return to my house from where I came out.">Luke 11:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>.) As the removal or pardon of sin is often represented in the Bible by its being banished into the uttermost parts of the earth and seas (<a href="/micah/7-19.htm" title="He will turn again, he will have compassion on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.">Micah 7:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm" title="As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.">Psalm 103:12</a>), nothing could be more striking or convey to the people the idea of absolute forgiveness better than this symbolical act of sending the goat laden with the sins of the congregation to the wilderness, the abode of the prince of darkness, back to the author of all sin. The rendering, <span class= "ital">scapegoat, </span>is contrary to the manifest antithesis of the verse. If the one member "For Jehovah" denotes a person, the second member "For Azazel," which forms the contrast, must, <span class= "ital">prima facie, </span>also denote a person.
