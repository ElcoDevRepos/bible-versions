The bull serves as a sin offering, which is a common practice in the sacrificial system of ancient Israel. This act signifies the need for purification from sin before approaching God. The bull, as a sacrificial animal, represents the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>took some of the blood</b><br>Blood is a central element in the sacrificial system, symbolizing life and atonement. In Leviticus, blood is often used for purification and consecration. The taking of the blood signifies the transfer of sin from the people to the sacrificial animal, a concept that is foundational in the theology of atonement.<p><b>and applied it with his finger to all four horns of the altar</b><br>The altar's horns are significant as they represent strength and power. Applying blood to the horns symbolizes the sanctification and purification of the altar, making it holy and acceptable for offerings to God. This act also signifies the altar's role as a place of divine encounter and atonement.<p><b>purifying the altar</b><br>The purification of the altar is necessary to make it a suitable place for sacrifices. In the ancient Near Eastern context, purification rituals were common to remove any defilement. This act underscores the holiness required in worship and the need for a mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar</b><br>Pouring the remaining blood at the base of the altar completes the sacrificial ritual. This act signifies the totality of the offering and the complete surrender to God's will. It also represents the cleansing of the community from sin, as the blood covers the altar, symbolizing the covering of sin.<p><b>and consecrated it so that atonement could be made on it</b><br>Consecration sets the altar apart for holy use, indicating that it is now dedicated to God. Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the sacrificial system. This phrase highlights the purpose of the altar as a means for atonement, pointing to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the sacrificial system by offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to deliver His laws.

The reason of this is that Aaron was not yet high priest, and also that the offering was made not only for Aaron, but also for his sons; and further, the blood as well as the anointing oil was required to <span class="cmt_word">purify the altar, and sanctify it</span> (see <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Although the blood was not "brought into the tabernacle," yet the bullock was <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire without the camp,</span> not eaten according to the rule of <a href="/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26, 30</a>. This was necessary, as there were as yet no priests to eat it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">slaughtered [the bull],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1431;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
