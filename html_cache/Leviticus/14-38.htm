The priest's role here is to inspect the house for signs of leprosy, which in this context refers to mold or mildew, not just the skin disease. This inspection outside the doorway signifies a boundary between the clean and unclean, a recurring theme in Leviticus. The priest's presence underscores the seriousness of the situation, as the house is potentially unclean and could affect the community's holiness. This act can be seen as a precursor to Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest, who mediates between God and humanity.<p><b>and close it up for seven days.</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation week in Genesis. Closing the house for seven days allows time for observation and potential healing, reflecting God's patience and provision for restoration. This period of waiting also mirrors the seven-day waiting periods found in other purification rituals in Leviticus, emphasizing the need for thoroughness in maintaining holiness. The act of closing up the house can be seen as a protective measure, preventing the spread of impurity, much like how Christ's sacrifice protects believers from the spread of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, the priest served as a mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing rituals and ensuring the community's spiritual cleanliness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Represents the dwelling place of an individual or family, which could become unclean due to mold or mildew, symbolizing sin or impurity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_doorway.htm">The Doorway</a></b><br>The threshold of the house, marking the boundary between the unclean interior and the clean exterior, symbolizing the separation between sin and holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_days.htm">Seven Days</a></b><br>A period of completeness and divine order in the Bible, often used for purification and reflection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_closing_the_house.htm">The Event of Closing the House</a></b><br>A ritual act performed by the priest to isolate the impurity, allowing time for potential healing or further inspection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's involvement underscores the importance of spiritual leadership in addressing sin and impurity within the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_house.htm">Symbolism of the House</a></b><br>Just as the house can become unclean, our lives can harbor sin.
