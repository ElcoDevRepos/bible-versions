This act symbolizes the removal of sin from the community. The bull, representing the sin offering, is taken outside to signify the separation of sin from the holy presence of God. This foreshadows the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was taken outside the city of Jerusalem to be crucified, bearing the sins of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p><b>and burn it</b><br>The burning of the bull signifies the complete destruction of sin. In the sacrificial system, burning was a way to purify and make atonement. The fire represents God's judgment and purification. This act of burning the sin offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who endured the fiery wrath of God for the sins of the world.<p><b>just as he burned the first bull</b><br>This refers to the earlier instructions given for the sin offering of the anointed priest (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>).

This communal aspect underscores the corporate responsibility of the people of Israel and their collective need for atonement. It points to the unity of the body of Christ, where believers are called to bear one another's burdens and seek forgiveness together. The sin offering prefigures Christ's atoning sacrifice, which was made once for all, covering the sins of the entire assembly of believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div

Moving the sacrificed bull beyond the camp&#8217;s border declared two truths:<p>&#8226; Sin is serious and must be removed from God&#8217;s dwelling place (see <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Only what is cleansed may remain in the midst of God&#8217;s people (compare <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11&#8211;12</a>, where Christ&#8217;s crucifixion &#8220;outside the gate&#8221; fulfills this pattern).<p>The congregation saw their guilt symbolically carried away, underscoring <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and burn it</b><p>Total burning (as in <a href="/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14</a>) pictured complete judgment. Nothing was eaten, unlike some other offerings (<a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>), because sin&#8217;s penalty demands full consumption. This foreshadowed the consuming wrath borne by Christ (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The fire outside reminded Israel that judgment, not fellowship, addresses sin.<p>&#8226; Yet the very act of burning showed that God provided a substitute so the people themselves would not be consumed (see <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, where the Lord&#8217;s anger is likened to fire).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as he burned the first bull</b><p>Consistency mattered. Earlier in the chapter the same ritual was prescribed for priestly sin (<a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12</a>). God&#8217;s standards do not change with the offender&#8217;s identity (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeating the method taught Israel that sin offerings, whether for leaders or assembly, receive the same divine treatment&#8212;equal justice and equal mercy.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;just as&#8221; points to God&#8217;s reliable pattern; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a> notes that the law&#8217;s &#8220;shadow&#8221; repeatedly signaled the need for a better, once-for-all sacrifice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is the sin offering for the assembly</b><p>Unlike voluntary offerings, this sacrifice was mandatory whenever the whole community sinned unintentionally (<a href="/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Corporate responsibility: even unintentional sins defile the covenant people (<a href="/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Corporate grace: God provided one bull for all, hinting at Christ&#8217;s one sacrifice &#8220;for the whole world&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>).<p>The blood already sprinkled inside the tabernacle (<a href="/leviticus/4-17.htm">Leviticus 4:17&#8211;18</a>) secured forgiveness; the burning outside confirmed the removal of guilt (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/4-21.htm">Leviticus 4:21</a> illustrates the holy logic of atonement: sin must leave God&#8217;s presence, be judged fully, follow God&#8217;s unchanging pattern, and cover the entire covenant community.
