The male goat, often used in sin offerings, symbolizes the need for a substitute to bear the consequences of sin. This practice foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The use of a goat specifically may also connect to the Day of Atonement rituals, where one goat was sacrificed and another was sent into the wilderness as a scapegoat (Leviticus 16), symbolizing the removal of sin.<p><b>and two male lambs a year old as a peace offering</b><br>The peace offering, also known as a fellowship offering, was a voluntary act of worship expressing thanksgiving and fellowship with God. The use of two male lambs signifies completeness and abundance in the offering. Lambs, being pure and innocent, are a type of Christ, who is referred to as the Lamb without blemish or defect (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The peace offering allowed the offerer to share in a communal meal, symbolizing restored fellowship with God and others. This offering points to the peace and reconciliation brought through Christ's sacrifice, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where He is our peace, breaking down the dividing wall of hostility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the instructions in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and festivals were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where offerings and sacrifices were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice made to atone for unintentional sins, symbolizing purification and forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving, often shared between the offerer, the priests, and God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrifices.htm">Understanding Sacrifices</a></b><br>The sin and peace offerings in <a href="/leviticus/23-19.htm">Leviticus 23:19</a> highlight the need for atonement and reconciliation with God.

The one before us speaks of the sacrifices which are to accompany the wave loaves, whilst the order in Numbers refers to the properly appointed sacrifices for the festival.
