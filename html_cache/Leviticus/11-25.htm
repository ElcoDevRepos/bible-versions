The context is the dietary laws given to the Israelites, which distinguish between clean and unclean animals. The act of touching a carcass rendered a person ceremonially unclean, emphasizing the importance of purity and separation from death, which is seen as a result of sin. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and the need for God's people to be set apart. The handling of carcasses also has practical implications, as it could prevent the spread of disease, showing God's care for the health of His people.<p><b>must wash his clothes</b><br>Washing clothes symbolizes purification and the removal of impurity. In the ancient Near Eastern context, washing was a common ritual for cleansing, both physically and spiritually. This act signifies a return to a state of purity and readiness to participate in community worship and activities. The requirement to wash clothes after contact with a carcass underscores the seriousness of maintaining holiness and the need for continual cleansing, which is a precursor to the New Testament teaching on spiritual cleansing through Christ.<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>The state of being unclean until evening indicates a temporary period of impurity. This time frame allowed for reflection and acknowledgment of the need for purification. The evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing renewal and restoration. This concept of temporary uncleanness points to the transient nature of sin's effects and foreshadows the ultimate cleansing and redemption found in Jesus Christ. The evening purification aligns with the biblical theme of light overcoming darkness, as seen in the creation narrative and fulfilled in the coming of Christ, the Light of the World.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The primary human author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws of cleanliness and uncleanliness were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/carcasses.htm">Carcasses</a></b><br>Refers to the dead bodies of animals that are considered unclean according to the dietary laws in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time by which the person who touched an unclean carcass would be considered clean again, symbolizing a new day and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus were designed to set the Israelites apart as God's holy people.

While the ceremonial aspect was temporary, the principle endures: contact with impurity requires deliberate washing, and true purification is fulfilled in Christ, who alone removes our uncleanness and enables us to live holy lives every day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And whosoever beareth.</span>--But he who removed the carcase out of the camp or city, or from one place to another, not only contracted defilement for the rest of the day, but had to wash the clothes which he had on, since the pollution by carrying is greater than that by touching. During the time of the second Temple, the administrators of the law declared that wherever the Law enjoins that <span class= "bld">a </span>man should "wash his clothes" because of the legal defilement which he contracted, it included the command of bathing the body, and that it was only omitted here and in <a href="/leviticus/11-28.htm" title="And he that bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:28</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm" title="And he that eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:40</a> for the sake of brevity.
