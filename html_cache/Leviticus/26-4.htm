In the ancient Near East, agriculture was heavily dependent on seasonal rains, particularly the early and latter rains mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>. The Israelites understood rain as a sign of divine favor, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>, where Elijah prays for rain after a drought. The phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>). Rain in its season also symbolizes spiritual blessings and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23-29</a> and <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>.<p><b>and the land will yield its produce</b><br>This promise highlights the fertility of the Promised Land, a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The land's productivity is contingent upon Israel's faithfulness to God's commandments. The produce of the land is a tangible sign of God's provision and faithfulness, as seen in the blessings of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4-5</a>. The land yielding its produce also points to the eschatological hope of a restored creation, where the earth will be renewed and fruitful (<a href="/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35:1-2</a>). This phrase can be seen as a type of the spiritual fruitfulness expected of believers, as described in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a> and <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.<p><b>and the trees of the field will bear their fruit</b><br>The fruit-bearing trees symbolize abundance and prosperity, reflecting the Edenic ideal where God provides abundantly for His creation (<a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>). In the context of Leviticus, this promise is part of the blessings for obedience, contrasting with the curses for disobedience that include agricultural failure (<a href="/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a>). The imagery of fruitful trees is also used in prophetic literature to describe the Messianic age, where peace and prosperity will prevail (<a href="/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus uses the metaphor of trees and fruit to teach about the evidence of a righteous life (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-20</a>), and believers are encouraged to bear spiritual fruit as a sign of their connection to Christ (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, promising blessings to the Israelites for their obedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's covenant promises, including the blessings of rain and fruitful harvests.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where these blessings would manifest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The mediator of the covenant, through whom God communicated His laws and promises to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which includes blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_brings_blessings.htm">Obedience Brings Blessings</a></b><br>The verse underscores the principle that God's blessings are often contingent upon our obedience to His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>Trust in God's provision is essential, as He promises to meet our needs when we align our lives with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seasonal_timing.htm">Seasonal Timing</a></b><br>Just as rain comes in its season, God's blessings often come in His perfect timing, requiring patience and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_as_a_sign_of_faithfulness.htm">Fruitfulness as a Sign of Faithfulness</a></b><br>The fruitfulness of the land is a metaphor for the spiritual fruitfulness that results from a life lived in obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Understanding our relationship with God as a covenant helps us see the importance of faithfulness and the blessings that follow.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_26_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 26:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_26_4_God_s_reward_for_obedience.htm">How does Leviticus 26:4 illustrate God's provision for obedience in our lives?

In Palestine the proper season for the early rain is from about the middle of October until December, thus preparing the ground for receiving the seed, whilst that of the latter or vernal rain is in the months of March and April, just before the harvest. Thus, also, in the covenant which God is to make with His people, a similar promise is made, "I will cause the showers to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing" (<a href="/ezekiel/34-26.htm" title="And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.">Ezekiel 34:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - These verses appear to have been in the mind, not of Joel only, as already pointed out, but of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20-31</a>).
