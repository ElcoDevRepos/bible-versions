The context is the various ways an individual might become ceremonially unclean or guilty, such as through unintentional sins or failing to fulfill an oath. The Hebrew term for guilt here implies a breach of trust or a failure in duty. This reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, emphasizing the need for purity and the restoration of relationship with God. The idea of guilt is foundational in understanding the need for atonement, which is a central theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>he must confess</b><br>Confession is a critical step in the process of atonement. It involves acknowledging one's sin before God, which is a prerequisite for forgiveness. This practice is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>, where David speaks of confessing his transgressions to the Lord. Confession is not merely an admission of guilt but a turning away from sin, which is a theme that carries into the New Testament, particularly in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. The act of confession underscores the importance of humility and repentance in the believer's life.<p><b>the sin he has committed,</b><br>The specificity of confessing the particular sin highlights the personal responsibility each individual has before God. This reflects the broader biblical principle that sin is not just a general condition but involves specific actions that violate God's law. The need for confession and atonement for each sin underscores the seriousness with which God views sin and the necessity of maintaining holiness. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where Jesus' sacrifice is seen as the ultimate atonement for sin, fulfilling the requirements of the law and providing a way for believers to be reconciled to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as a guide for holy living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial system established by God for the atonement of sins, which is the context of this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites would bring their offerings and where the priests would perform the rituals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The mediators between God and the Israelites, responsible for performing the sacrifices and ensuring the laws were followed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_confession.htm">The Necessity of Confession</a></b><br>Confession is a crucial step in the process of repentance and reconciliation with God.

The use of the word <span class="accented">asham</span>, translated <span class="cmt_word">trespass offering</span> in verse 6, and the character of the four cases have led many commentators to regard verses 1-13 as dealing with the trespass offering rather than the sin offering.
