This offering was entirely consumed by fire, representing total surrender to God. The act of presenting the burnt offering was a priestly duty, emphasizing the role of the priest as a mediator between God and the people. This offering foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as He offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>and offered it according to the ordinance.</b><br>The phrase "according to the ordinance" underscores the importance of following God's specific instructions for worship. In Leviticus, God provided detailed laws for offerings, highlighting His holiness and the need for order in worship. This adherence to divine instruction reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The meticulous observance of these ordinances points to the perfect obedience of Christ, who fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
