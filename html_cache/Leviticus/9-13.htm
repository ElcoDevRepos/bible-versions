The phrase "piece by piece" indicates the careful and methodical manner in which the offering was prepared and presented. This reflects the meticulous nature of the Levitical priesthood and the importance of following God's instructions precisely. The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, was entirely consumed by fire, representing total surrender to God. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly for humanity's sins.<p><b>including the head</b><br>The inclusion of the head in the burnt offering signifies the completeness of the sacrifice. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the head often symbolized leadership and authority. By offering the head, the Israelites demonstrated their submission to God's authority. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who is the head of the Church and offered Himself fully to God. The head's inclusion also emphasizes the thoroughness required in worship and sacrifice, leaving nothing withheld from God.<p><b>and he burned them on the altar</b><br>The burning of the offering on the altar signifies purification and atonement. Fire in the Bible often represents God's presence and judgment, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the pillar of fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The altar, a sacred place of sacrifice, was where reconciliation between God and man occurred. This act of burning the offering points to the future sacrifice of Christ, who bore the judgment of sin on the cross. The altar's role in the sacrificial system underscores the necessity of atonement for sin, a theme fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus' death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader of the Israelites who received the law from God and instructed Aaron and his sons in the priestly duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>- The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, responsible for performing the sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, witnessing the establishment of the priestly system and sacrificial rituals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where sacrifices were offered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burnt_offering.htm">The Burnt Offering</a></b><br>- A type of sacrifice in which the entire animal was consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_sacrifice.htm">The Significance of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The burnt offering represents total surrender and dedication to God.
