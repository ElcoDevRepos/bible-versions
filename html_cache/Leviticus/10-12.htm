Moses, as the leader and mediator, addresses Aaron and his surviving sons, emphasizing the continuity of priestly duties despite personal loss. Eleazar and Ithamar are now the focus, stepping into roles of greater responsibility. This reflects the importance of obedience and reverence in the priestly office, a theme consistent throughout Leviticus.<p><b>Take the grain offering that remains from the food offerings to the LORD</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah," was a vital part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God. It was made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, and a portion was burned on the altar while the rest was for the priests (Leviticus 2). This offering represents the sustenance provided by God and the priest's role in mediating between God and the people. The phrase underscores the continuity of worship practices even in times of crisis.<p><b>and eat it without leaven beside the altar</b><br>Eating without leaven signifies purity and separation from sin, as leaven often symbolizes corruption or sin in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). Consuming the offering beside the altar indicates the sacredness of the act, performed in the presence of God. This practice foreshadows the sinless nature of Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>).<p><b>because it is most holy</b><br>The designation "most holy" signifies the highest level of sanctity, reserved for offerings that are directly associated with the altar and God's presence. This underscores the seriousness of the priestly duties and the need for holiness in approaching God. The concept of holiness is central to Leviticus, reflecting God's nature and His call for His people to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This holiness is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect holiness and enables believers to approach God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicates God's laws and instructions to the people.

As Aaron lost his two eldest sons in consequence of their having violated the sacrificial regulations, Moses is most anxious to guard him and his two younger sons against transgressing any other part of the ritual connected with the same sacrifices, lest they also should incur a similar punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings.</span>--The meat offering which was offered by the nation the day after the consecration, when the calamity happened (see <a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm" title="And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it on the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.">Leviticus 9:17</a>), and which was not as yet eaten. With the exception of the handful which was burnt on the altar, all belonged to the priests. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/6-14.htm" title="And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.">Leviticus 6:14-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And eat it without leaven beside the altar.</span>--That is, in the court of the tent of meeting, where the altar of burnt offering stood.

Under his instructions, Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar eat the remainder of <span class="cmt_word">the meat offering</span> (<a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), in the court of the tabernacle, and reserve <span class="cmt_word">the wave breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">heave shoulder</span> to <span class="cmt_word">eat in a clean place</span>, that is, not necessarily within the court; but he finds that the sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), which ought to be eaten by the priests, had been burnt. The rule was that, when the blood was presented in the tabernacle, the flesh was burned; when it was not, the flesh was eaten by the priests. In the present case, the blood had not been brought within the holy place, and yet the flesh had been burned instead of being eaten. Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, and demanded an explanation. Aaron's plea of defense was twofold. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> His sons had fulfilled aright the ritual of their own sin offering and burnt offering, that is, the offerings made for the priests, and it had been rather his duty than theirs to see that the ritual of the sin offering of the congregation had been properly carried out. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The state of distress in which he was, and the near escape that he had had from ceremonial defilement, and the sense of sin brought home to him by his children's death, had made him unfit and unable to eat the sin offering of the people, as he should have done under other circumstances. With this plea Moses was content. It was true that the letter of the Law had been broken, but there was a sufficient cause for it (see <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It appears from hence that the expiation wrought by the sin offering was not complete until the whole ceremony was accomplished, the last act of which was the eating of the flesh by the priests in one class of sin offering, and the burning the flesh outside the camp in the other. It has been questioned, what is the full meaning of the expression, God hath given it you - the flesh of the sin offering - to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord. Archdeacon Freeman expresses the view of A Lapide, Keil, and many others when he says that, by eating the flesh of the offering, the priests "in a deep mystery neutralized, through the holiness vested in them by their consecration, the sin which the offerer had laid upon the victim and upon them" ('Principles of Divine Service,' part 2). Oehler, on the other hand (Herzog's 'Cyclop.,' 10), maintains that the priests did no more by this act than <span class="accented">declare</span> the removal of the sin already taken away; with which accords Philo's explanation ('De Vict.,' 13, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 6.) that the object of the sacrificial meal was to carry assurance of acceptance to the offerer, "since God would never have allowed his servants to partake of it had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin atoned for." Neither of these explanations seems to be altogether satisfactory. The former attributes more meaning to the expression <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> than it appears to have elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> and <a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, where Aaron is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity of the holy things</span> and <span class="accented">of the sanctuary</span>; and <a href="/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> of Israel and Judah. The latter interpretation appears too much to evacuate the meaning of the words. It is quite certain that the part of the ceremony by which the atonement was wrought (if it was wrought by any one part) was the offering of the blood for the covering of the offerer's sins, but yet this action of the priests in eating the flesh of the victim was in some way also connected with the atonement, not only with the assurance of its having been wrought; but in what way this was effected we are not told, and cannot pronounce. The words <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> are equivalent to making atonement for by taking the sin in some sense upon themselves (cf. <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, "He shall bear their iniquities," and <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away [or beareth] the sin of the world'). Accordingly, Bishop Patrick comments: "The very eating of the people's sin offering argued the sins of the people were, <span class="accented">in some sort</span>, laid upon the priests, to be taken away by them. From whence the sacrifice of Christ may be explained, who is said to <span class="accented">bear our iniquity</span> (as the priest is here said to do), all our sins being laid on him, who took upon him to make an expiation for them by the sacrifice of himself. For the priest, hereby eating of the sin offering, receiving the guilt upon himself, may well be thought to prefigure One who should be both Priest and Sacrifice for sin; which was accomplished in Christ" (on <a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
