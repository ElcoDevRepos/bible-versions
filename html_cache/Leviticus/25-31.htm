Walled cities provided protection and were often centers of trade and governance, while unwalled villages were more rural and agricultural. The lack of walls indicated vulnerability and a reliance on community and divine protection rather than military strength. This reflects the Israelites' dependence on God for security, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, which emphasizes that unless the Lord watches over a city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.<p><b>are to be considered as open fields</b><br>This phrase indicates that houses in unwalled villages were treated similarly to agricultural land in terms of redemption and Jubilee laws. Unlike houses in walled cities, which could be sold permanently, these properties were subject to redemption and release. This reflects the agrarian nature of Israelite society, where land was a primary source of sustenance and identity. The treatment of these houses as open fields underscores the importance of land in maintaining family heritage and economic stability, as seen in the story of Naboth's vineyard in <a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>.<p><b>They may be redeemed</b><br>The concept of redemption here is rooted in the Levitical law, which allowed for the repurchase of property by the original owner or a close relative. This ensured that land remained within the family, preserving tribal inheritance as outlined in <a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>. The redemption process is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He redeems believers from sin, restoring them to their intended inheritance in God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<p><b>and they shall be released in the Jubilee</b><br>The Jubilee, occurring every 50th year, was a time of liberation and restoration, where debts were forgiven, and land was returned to its original owners. This practice emphasized God's sovereignty over the land and His provision for His people. It foreshadows the ultimate redemption and restoration found in Christ, who proclaims the "year of the Lord's favor" in <a href="/luke/4-19.htm">Luke 4:19</a>, symbolizing spiritual freedom and the restoration of all things.
