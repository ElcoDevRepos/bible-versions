This period of 49 years culminates in the Jubilee year, a time of rest and restoration. The concept of consecration here implies setting apart the year as holy, dedicated to God. This mirrors the Sabbath principle, emphasizing rest and reliance on God's provision. The number fifty is symbolic of freedom and redemption, as seen in the Pentecost, which occurs fifty days after Passover.<p><b>and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants.</b><br>The proclamation of liberty is a central theme of the Jubilee, reflecting God's desire for freedom and justice. This liberty includes the release of Hebrew slaves and the return of property to original family owners. It serves as a reminder of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, reinforcing the idea that ultimate freedom comes from God. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which Jesus references in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>, indicating the fulfillment of this liberty through His ministry.<p><b>It shall be your Jubilee,</b><br>The term "Jubilee" comes from the Hebrew word "yobel," meaning a ram's horn, which was used to announce the start of this year. The Jubilee represents a time of economic and social reset, ensuring that wealth and property do not become concentrated in the hands of a few. It reflects God's concern for social justice and equality, providing a safeguard against perpetual poverty and servitude.<p><b>when each of you is to return to his property</b><br>The return to one's property signifies the restoration of land ownership to its original family. This practice prevents the permanent loss of inheritance and maintains the tribal allotments given by God. It underscores the belief that the land ultimately belongs to God, and the Israelites are merely stewards. This principle is foundational to the understanding of God's covenant with Israel and His provision for His people.<p><b>and to his clan.</b><br>Returning to one's clan emphasizes the importance of family and community in Israelite society. It reinforces the social structure and ensures that familial ties remain strong. This return is not just physical but also relational, restoring individuals to their rightful place within their community. It highlights the value God places on relationships and the support system provided by the family unit. This restoration is a type of the ultimate reconciliation and unity found in Christ, who restores believers to their heavenly family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, including the commandment of the Jubilee year.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The geographical context where the Jubilee was to be observed, emphasizing the land's sanctity and God's ownership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jubilee_year.htm">The Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event occurring every fifty years, marked by the release of debts, liberation of slaves, and return of property.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws, including the instructions for the Jubilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Responsible for proclaiming the Jubilee and ensuring its observance among the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_rest_and_renewal.htm">The Principle of Rest and Renewal</a></b><br>The Jubilee year teaches us the importance of rest and renewal, both physically and spiritually.

Hence as new year was with the Hebrews the preparation for the Day of Atonement, so it also became the prelude to the acts of mercy which finally came into operation on the Day of Atonement. They therefore began counting the cycle of the jubile from the first of Tishri, or new year, though they proclaimed it on the tenth, or on the close of the Day of Atonement. In accordance with this the authorities during the second Temple record that "from the Feast of Trumpets <span class= "ital">[i.e., </span>Tishri 1] till the Day of Atonement <span class= "ital">[i.e., </span>Tishri 10], the slaves were neither manumitted to return to their homes, nor were made use of by their masters, but ate, drank, rejoiced, and wore garlands; and when the Day of Atonement came the judges blew the cornet, the slaves were manumitted to return to their homes, and the fields were set free."<p><span class= "bld">And proclaim liberty . . . unto all the inhabitants</span>--That is, to all the Israelites, who are the true possessors of the land. Hence the ancient authorities conclude that the law of jubile was only in force as long as the whole Jewish nation dwelt in the land, but not after the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, were carried into captivity by Pul and Tilgath-Pilneser kings of Assyria (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>), because "all the inhabitants" of the land dwelt no longer in it. It is from this declaration to proclaim liberty that the year of jubile is also called "the year of freedom" (<a href="/ezekiel/46-17.htm" title="But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty;
