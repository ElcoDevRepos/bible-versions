This concept underscores the importance of holiness and purity in the Israelite community, as God is holy (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The laws of cleanliness were designed to teach the Israelites about the nature of sin and the need for spiritual purity.<p><b>eats meat from the peace offering</b><br>The peace offering, also known as the fellowship offering, was a voluntary sacrifice made to express gratitude and fellowship with God. It was unique in that the offerer, the priest, and God all shared in the meal, symbolizing communion and peace with God. Eating this meat while unclean would desecrate the sacredness of the offering and violate the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>that belongs to the LORD</b><br>The peace offering was considered holy and set apart for God. It was a tangible expression of the covenant relationship between God and His people. The phrase emphasizes that the offering is not merely a communal meal but a sacred act of worship dedicated to the LORD. This reflects the broader biblical theme that all offerings and sacrifices are ultimately for God's glory and honor.<p><b>that person must be cut off from his people</b><br>Being "cut off" from the people of Israel was a severe penalty, indicating either excommunication or, in some interpretations, death. This punishment highlights the seriousness of maintaining ritual purity and the sanctity of the community. It serves as a warning against defiling what is holy and underscores the communal responsibility to uphold God's laws. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where the church is called to maintain purity and holiness (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons /
