This role highlights the integration of spiritual and physical well-being in the community. The examination by a priest underscores the importance of discernment and authority in determining the presence of impurity. This practice reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>, "Be holy, because I am holy."<p><b>and if the hair in the infection has turned white</b><br>The change in hair color was a specific diagnostic criterion for identifying certain skin diseases, possibly including leprosy. This detail indicates a thorough and careful observation process. White hair in an infection could symbolize death or decay, contrasting with the vitality of healthy skin. This imagery can be connected to spiritual death and the need for purification, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."<p><b>and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin</b><br>The depth of the sore was another critical factor in diagnosis, suggesting a more serious condition. This depth can symbolize the pervasive nature of sin, which affects not just the surface but penetrates deeper into one's being. The concept of depth in sin is echoed in <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>, "Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place."<p><b>it is a skin disease</b><br>The identification of a skin disease required the person to be set apart from the community, reflecting the need for purity and the prevention of contamination. This separation can be seen as a type of spiritual quarantine, emphasizing the need for cleansing and restoration. The concept of disease as a metaphor for sin is prevalent throughout Scripture, as in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure."<p><b>After the priest examines him</b><br>The repeated examination by the priest underscores the importance of careful and repeated assessment in matters of purity and health. This process reflects the need for ongoing spiritual vigilance and accountability within the community. The role of the priest as a mediator between God and man is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>he must pronounce him unclean</b><br>The pronouncement of uncleanness had significant social and religious implications, leading to isolation from the community. This declaration serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for atonement and reconciliation. The concept of uncleanness and the need for purification is fulfilled in Christ, who cleanses us from all unrighteousness, as stated in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests were responsible for religious duties and served as mediators between God and the people.

The authorities during the second Temple defined it that there must at least be two hairs white, at the root and in the body of the bright spot, before the patient can be declared unclean. The word <span class= "ital">plague, </span>in accordance with a usage common in Hebrew--to put the abstract for the concrete--denotes here the plagued spot, or the spot affected by the plague, whilst in <a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm" title="If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague seven days:">Leviticus 13:4</a> it means the person affected by this disorder. Thus in <a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm" title="You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:32</a>, "the hoary head" stands for <span class= "ital">hoary-headed person.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the plague in sight be deeper than the skin.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and the appearance of the plagued spot be deeper, &c. </span>The second symptom which shows the development of the disorder is that the spot affected by this plague appears to be deeper than the rest of the skin.<p><span class= "bld">Pronounce him unclean.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make him unclean. </span>According to the frequently occurring phraseology a man is said to <span class= "ital">do </span>that which in his official capacity <span class= "ital">he </span>pronounces as done, or orders to be done. Thus Ezekiel is said "to destroy the city" when he simply foretold its destruction (<a href="/ezekiel/43-3.htm" title="And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 43:3</a>). The existence of these two symptoms made it incumbent upon the priest to declare the person unclean, and hence imparting defilement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the hair in the plague is turned white.</span> This is the first symptom, and the most noticeable as the commencement of the disease. The hair around the spot loses its colour and becomes thin and weak, the separate hairs being hardly stronger or individually thicker than down. The second symptom is when <span class="cmt_word">the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh</span>; that is, below the upper skin, or cuticle, and in the real cutis. These two symptoms distinguish real leprosy from other affections which at first bear a similar appearance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
