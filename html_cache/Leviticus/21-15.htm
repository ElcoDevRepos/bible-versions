In the context of Leviticus, the priests were set apart to serve God and were required to adhere to strict standards of conduct and purity. The defilement of offspring could refer to marrying someone who was not considered pure according to the Levitical laws, which could lead to a compromised priestly line. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>, "Be holy, because I am holy." The concern for purity among the people of Israel is a recurring theme, highlighting the need for a community that reflects God's holiness.<p><b>for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority and role of God in the sanctification process. The sanctification of the priests was not merely a result of their adherence to the law but was ultimately an act of God. This reflects the broader biblical principle that holiness and sanctification are gifts from God, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>, "And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." The phrase also points to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God sets apart His people for His purposes. The sanctification of the priests serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate High Priest, sanctifying believers through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a> is on the priests, specifically the high priest, who is held to a higher standard of holiness due to his role in mediating between God and the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offspring.htm">The Offspring</a></b><br>The verse refers to the offspring of the priests, emphasizing the importance of maintaining purity and holiness within the priestly lineage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God Himself is the one who sanctifies the priests, setting them apart for His service and requiring them to adhere to His standards of holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The broader community among whom the priests serve and whose spiritual well-being is impacted by the priests' adherence to God's commands.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship where the priests perform their duties, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_leadership.htm">Holiness in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders in the church are called to a higher standard of holiness, reflecting God's character to those they lead.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_impact.htm">Generational Impact</a></b><br>The spiritual integrity of leaders affects not only their immediate ministry but also future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sanctification.htm">God's Sanctification</a></b><br>It is God who sanctifies and sets apart His people for His purposes.
