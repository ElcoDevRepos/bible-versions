In the context of Leviticus, the law provided a means for individuals to recognize their wrongdoing and seek reconciliation with God. The concept of guilt is central to the sacrificial system, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity. The recognition of sin is also echoed in the New Testament, where confession and repentance are emphasized (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>he must return what he has stolen</b><br>Restitution is a key principle in biblical law, emphasizing the importance of making amends for wrongs committed against others. This requirement reflects God's justice and the need for restoring relationships. The act of returning stolen goods is not only a legal obligation but also a moral one, demonstrating a change of heart and a commitment to righteousness. This principle is seen in the story of Zacchaeus in <a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>, where he offers to repay those he has defrauded.<p><b>or taken by extortion</b><br>Extortion involves taking something from someone through force or threats, and it is condemned in Scripture as a violation of justice and love for one's neighbor. The inclusion of extortion in this passage underscores the comprehensive nature of God's law, which addresses various forms of wrongdoing. The prophets frequently denounced extortion and exploitation, calling for justice and fairness (<a href="/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>, <a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>).<p><b>or the deposit entrusted to him</b><br>This phrase refers to the responsibility of safeguarding what belongs to others. Trust and integrity are vital components of community life, and violating this trust is a serious offense. The requirement to return a deposit highlights the importance of faithfulness and accountability. In the New Testament, Jesus teaches about being faithful with what is entrusted to us, whether it be talents, resources, or responsibilities (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>or the lost property he found</b><br>Finding lost property and failing to return it is considered theft in biblical law. This commandment emphasizes the value of honesty and respect for others' possessions. The principle of returning lost property is rooted in the love for one's neighbor, as outlined in the broader context of Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). It reflects the character of God, who seeks to restore what is lost, a theme that is ultimately fulfilled in the redemptive work of Christ (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including those in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, forming the covenant community of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites worshiped and where the laws were often taught and practiced.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The mediators between God and the Israelites, responsible for teaching and enforcing the laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who established the covenant and provided the laws for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_restitution.htm">The Importance of Restitution</a></b><br>Restitution is a key aspect of justice and righteousness in God's eyes.

In <a href="/bsb/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6</a>, the wrongdoing is not merely horizontal (against a neighbor) but vertical (against God). Recognition of guilt is the first step toward restoration. Scripture consistently calls for honest admission: &#8220;He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>). David models this transparency: &#8220;I said, &#8216;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,&#8217; and You forgave the guilt of my sin&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>). The prodigal son echoes the same heart: &#8220;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18</a>). Only when guilt is acknowledged can God&#8217;s prescribed remedy&#8212;both spiritual and practical&#8212;begin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must return what he has stolen or taken by extortion</b><p>Restitution is not optional; it is commanded. The thief must give back what was taken, underscoring that repentance has tangible evidence. <a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a> lays out the principle: &#8220;If a man steals an ox or a sheep&#8230; he must pay back five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.&#8221; <a href="/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6-7</a> ties the act to confession: the guilty party &#8220;must confess the sin&#8230; make full restitution&#8230; and add a fifth of the value.&#8221; Zacchaeus embodies this heart: &#8220;If I have cheated anyone out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). Genuine faith never divorces spiritual forgiveness from real-world responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or the deposit entrusted to him</b><p>God guards what others place in our care. A &#8220;deposit&#8221; might be money, goods, or any entrusted responsibility. <a href="/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a> addresses such cases: &#8220;If a man gives his neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen&#8230; the thief, if caught, must pay back double.&#8221; Breaching trust desecrates God&#8217;s character, for He is the ultimate Guardian of what is entrusted to Him (<a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>). Therefore, faithfulness with another person&#8217;s property is a direct reflection of reverence for the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or the lost property he found</b><p>Even accidental possession of what is not ours demands action. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1-3</a> commands returning a brother&#8217;s stray animal or any lost item. Keeping found property may seem harmless, yet God calls it sin if unreturned, because it violates love of neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a> states that the repentant one &#8220;restores a pledge, repays what he has stolen,&#8221; and thereby demonstrates genuine life change. Love seeks the owner&#8217;s good, not personal gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a> teaches that true repentance starts with admitting guilt and culminates in concrete restitution&#8212;whether for outright theft, breach of trust, or failure to return lost items. God&#8217;s law marries confession with action, revealing His heart for justice, restoration, and the protection of neighborly relationships. The same principle carries into the New Testament, showing that saving faith still produces visible fruit of integrity and restitution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And it shall come to pass, token he hath so sinned, and acknowledged his guilt. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/4-22.htm" title="When a ruler has sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;">Leviticus 4:22</a>.)
