The context of Leviticus is the establishment of a holy community set apart for God, with laws that reflect His holiness. The prohibition is part of a broader set of sexual ethics that include prohibitions against incest, adultery, and bestiality (Leviticus 18). The phrase "as with a woman" indicates the natural order of sexual relations as understood in the biblical context, which is rooted in the creation narrative of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1-2</a>, where God creates male and female for the purpose of procreation and companionship. This law reflects the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel, where maintaining purity and distinctiveness from surrounding nations was paramount.<p><b>they have both committed an abomination</b><br>The term "abomination" is used in the Old Testament to describe actions that are detestable or repugnant to God. It is often associated with idolatry and practices that defile the land or the people. In the context of Leviticus, abominations are actions that violate the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This term is also used in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, to describe behaviors that are morally reprehensible. The use of "abomination" underscores the severity of the offense in the eyes of God and the need for the community to uphold divine standards of holiness.<p><b>They must surely be put to death</b><br>The prescribed penalty reflects the seriousness with which the Mosaic Law treats violations of God's commandments. Capital punishment in ancient Israel served as a deterrent and a means of purging evil from the community (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>). This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where civil and religious laws were intertwined. The death penalty for certain sins underscores the holiness of God and the need for His people to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). In the New Testament, while the civil penalties of the Mosaic Law are not applied to the church, the moral principles remain significant, and the call to holiness is reiterated (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>their blood is upon them</b><br>This phrase indicates personal responsibility for the sin committed. In the legal context of ancient Israel, it means that the individuals bear the guilt and consequences of their actions. The concept of blood being upon someone is seen in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>, where it signifies accountability for one's own sin. This principle of personal responsibility is echoed in the New Testament, where each person is accountable to God for their actions (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). The phrase also highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement, which in the Christian understanding is ultimately fulfilled in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, who takes upon Himself the sins of the world (1 <a href="/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of

href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a> has already labeled such an act &#8220;an abomination,&#8221; setting the moral standard before any penalty is given.<p>&#8226; Other passages echo this moral judgment: <a href="/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26-27</a> speaks of relations &#8220;contrary to nature,&#8221; and <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a> lists &#8220;men who have sex with men&#8221; among sins from which believers are called to turn and be washed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they

12:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The term applies equally to both participants, underscoring shared responsibility (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently treats sexual sin as serious because it distorts God&#8217;s design for relationships and the picture of Christ and His church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They must surely be put to death</b><p>&#8226; In Israel&#8217;s theocratic law, certain sins carried capital punishment to preserve holiness in the covenant community (<a

a directive for the church or modern governments (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; While the civil aspect has expired with Christ&#8217;s fulfillment of the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>), the moral principle&#8212;that this behavior is

href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights individual accountability before God (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even sins that carry the gravest guilt can be forgiven through repentance and faith in Christ (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a
