In the ancient Israelite society, economic disparity was acknowledged, and God provided a way for everyone to participate in the sacrificial system. The use of turtledoves or pigeons as offerings was common due to their availability and affordability, as seen in <a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>, where Mary and Joseph offer birds at Jesus' presentation in the temple. This provision underscores God's inclusivity and compassion for the poor.<p><b>he may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering</b><br>A tenth of an ephah is approximately 2.2 liters or about 2 quarts. Fine flour, a staple in ancient diets, was accessible to even the poorest individuals. This offering represents the individual's acknowledgment of sin and desire for atonement. The use of flour instead of an animal signifies the flexibility within the sacrificial system to accommodate different economic situations, emphasizing that the heart's intent is more important than the material value of the offering.<p><b>He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it</b><br>Olive oil and frankincense were typically added to grain offerings to enhance their aroma and significance, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>. However, their exclusion here indicates the distinct nature of the sin offering. The absence of these elements emphasizes the somberness of sin and the need for purification rather than celebration. This distinction sets the sin offering apart from other offerings that might symbolize thanksgiving or fellowship.<p><b>because it is a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was specifically for atonement and purification from sin, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4 and 5</a>. It served to restore the relationship between the individual and God, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement. This offering prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, as the sinless Lamb of God, provided the final atonement for sin, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>.
