The prohibition reflects the broader Levitical concern with holiness and separation from impurity, which was central to maintaining the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and has sexual relations with her,</b><br>The act of sexual relations during menstruation was seen as a violation of the purity laws. In the ancient Near Eastern context, blood was often associated with life and death, and thus had significant religious implications. This law underscores the importance of respecting the boundaries set by God for maintaining holiness.<p><b>he has exposed the source of her flow,</b><br>The phrase "exposed the source of her flow" indicates a breach of the natural and divinely ordained boundaries. Blood, particularly menstrual blood, was considered a powerful symbol of life and fertility, and its exposure was seen as a serious matter. This reflects the broader biblical theme of respecting the sanctity of life and the created order.<p><b>and she has uncovered the source of her blood.</b><br>The woman's role in the act is also acknowledged, indicating mutual responsibility. The uncovering of blood is symbolic of uncovering one's nakedness, a concept that is often associated with shame and dishonor in biblical texts (e.g., <a href="/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22-23</a>). This highlights the importance of maintaining personal and communal holiness.<p><b>Both of them must be cut off from among their people.</b><br>The consequence of being "cut off" suggests a severe penalty, possibly including excommunication or even death, as seen in other parts of the Torah (e.g., <a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>). This reflects the seriousness with which the community was to uphold God's laws. The phrase underscores the communal aspect of holiness, where individual actions impact the entire community's relationship with God. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where the purity and unity of the church are emphasized (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the laws, as they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes the holiness code for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the presence of God among the Israelites, emphasizing the need for purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The call to holiness is central to the life of a believer.
