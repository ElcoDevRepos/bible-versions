This could be a field, an animal, or another possession. The act of consecration was a voluntary vow, often made in gratitude or devotion. The option to redeem, or buy back, the field indicates the flexibility within the Mosaic Law for individuals to reassess their circumstances. This reflects God's understanding of human needs and changing situations. The concept of redemption is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing God's redemptive work through Christ, who redeems humanity from sin.<p><b>he must add a fifth to the assessed value,</b><br>The addition of a fifth (20%) to the assessed value of the field is a form of interest or penalty for redeeming something that was dedicated to God. This requirement ensured that the act of consecration was taken seriously and not done lightly. It also provided a means for the sanctuary to benefit from the transaction. The principle of adding a fifth is seen elsewhere in Leviticus, such as in the laws concerning restitution (<a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>). This reflects the biblical principle of restitution and the cost of redemption, pointing to the ultimate price paid by Christ for humanity's redemption.<p><b>and it shall belong to him.</b><br>Once the additional fifth is paid, the field returns to the original owner. This clause emphasizes the restoration of ownership upon fulfilling the redemption requirements. It highlights the balance between dedication to God and personal stewardship. The concept of belonging is significant in biblical theology, as it underscores the relationship between God and His people. Just as the field returns to the owner, believers are reminded of their belonging to God through Christ's redemptive work, reinforcing the covenant relationship established by God with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the laws of consecration and redemption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents property that could be consecrated to the Lord and later redeemed by the owner.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The ultimate owner of all land, to whom the field is consecrated.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave the laws to Moses, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_consecration.htm">Understanding Consecration</a></b><br>Recognize that consecration involves setting something apart for God's use, acknowledging His sovereignty over all we possess.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_redemption.htm">The Cost of Redemption</a></b><br>The requirement to add a fifth to the value of the field when redeeming it teaches us about the costliness of redemption, pointing to the ultimate price paid by Christ for our redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_ownership.htm">God's Ownership</a></b><br>This passage reminds us that everything we have belongs to God, and we are merely stewards of His resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_stewardship.htm">Faithfulness in Stewardship</a></b><br>As stewards, we are called to manage our resources wisely and in a way that honors God, including being willing to give back to Him what is rightfully His.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_redemption.htm">Spiritual Redemption</a></b><br>Just as the field could be redeemed, we too are redeemed by Christ.
