Oil was a valuable commodity in ancient Israel, often used for anointing kings and priests, signifying consecration and sanctification. The griddle, a flat cooking surface, indicates a method of preparation that was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, emphasizing the practical and communal aspects of worship. This method of cooking also ensured that the offering was thoroughly cooked, symbolizing completeness and purity.<p><b>you are to bring it well-kneaded</b><br>The instruction to knead the grain offering well signifies thorough preparation and dedication. Kneading involves effort and care, reflecting the worshiper's devotion and sincerity. This process also ensures that the ingredients are fully integrated, symbolizing unity and harmony in the offering. The act of kneading can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparation, where believers are called to be diligent and wholehearted in their service to God.<p><b>and present it as a grain offering broken in pieces,</b><br>Breaking the offering into pieces represents humility and submission before God. It signifies the breaking of one's own will and the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, whose body was broken for humanity's redemption. The grain offering, as a whole, points to the sustenance and provision of God, and breaking it into pieces highlights the distribution of God's blessings to His people.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" is a recurring theme in the sacrificial system, indicating God's acceptance and satisfaction with the offering. It reflects the idea that true worship, when done in obedience and sincerity, is delightful to God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be living sacrifices, offering themselves in a manner that is pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The pleasing aroma also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose offering of Himself was a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the instructions for offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>- The priests who were responsible for carrying out the offerings and sacrifices as prescribed in the law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where offerings and sacrifices were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>- A type of offering made to God, often symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>- The covenant name of God, to whom the offerings are made as a sign of worship and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for the grain offering highlight the importance of following God's commands precisely.

When Samuel anointed David &#8220;with oil&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), &#8220;the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a> ties oil and Spirit together: &#8220;&#8216;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,&#8217; says the LORD.&#8221; The daily use of oil reminds us that every act of worship depends on the Spirit&#8217;s enabling, not mere human effort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on a griddle</b><p>&#8226; A griddle (flat pan) produced a quick-cooked bread, ready for immediate use. The priest&#8217;s service was to be fresh each morning, not leftovers.<p>&#8226; This plain, open cooking method made the offering visible to all. Worship was never to be secretive or half-hearted.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel was told to set an &#8220;iron griddle&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/4-3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a>) as a symbolic wall; here, the griddle is for fellowship, not separation. God welcomes His priests&#8212;and, by extension, His people&#8212;to open, transparent communion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to bring it well-kneaded</b><p>&#8226; The flour and oil had to be thoroughly blended so that every bite carried the same flavor. God desires undivided, integrated devotion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a> shows Israel baking in haste &#8220;without leaven.&#8221; Here, the kneading is careful and deliberate&#8212;no shortcuts in daily consecration.<p>&#8226; Jesus compared the kingdom to yeast that a woman &#8220;hid in three measures of flour&#8221; until &#8220;all of it was leavened&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-21.htm">Luke 13:21</a>). Though the imagery differs, the principle is similar: the whole must be permeated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and present it as a grain offering</b><p>&#8226; Grain offerings were gifts, not sin offerings. They acknowledged God as provider (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>) and accompanied burnt offerings that pictured atonement.<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a> commands Israel, &#8220;Present My food offerings.&#8221; Daily worship keeps gratitude alive: we live by bread He first supplies.<p>&#8226; For priests, this particular offering also became their daily meal (<a href="/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>). Ministry flows from what we first give to God and then receive back sanctified.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>broken in pieces</b><p>&#8226; The loaf was divided so every priest could share. Worship is communal, not isolated.<p>&#8226; The breaking anticipates the Messiah: Jesus &#8220;took bread, gave thanks, and broke it&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>), declaring, &#8220;This is My body.&#8221; <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a> calls Him &#8220;the living bread...given for the life of the world.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Physical fragments did not diminish the offering&#8217;s worth; likewise, Christ&#8217;s body broken did not lessen His glory but displayed it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a> records, &#8220;The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma&#8221; of Noah&#8217;s sacrifice. The same language shows God&#8217;s delight here.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a> applies it to Jesus: &#8220;Christ loved us and gave Himself for us, a fragrant offering.&#8221; Every obedient act, however small, carries that fragrance when offered through Christ.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s pleasure, not our feelings, confirms true worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm">Leviticus 6:21</a> pictures a daily, Spirit-empowered act of worship: fresh bread mixed with oil, openly cooked, thoroughly prepared, offered gratefully, shared in fellowship, and enjoyed by God Himself.
