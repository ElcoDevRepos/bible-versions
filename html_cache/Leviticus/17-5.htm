The priest's involvement ensures that the sacrifices are conducted according to divine law.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and symbolized God's presence among His people.

He now provides the reason: every sacrifice must be redirected from private, unregulated locations to Himself.<p>&#8211; This safeguards Israel from idolatry. Sacrifices &#8220;in the open fields&#8221; had often been blended with pagan practices (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16-17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19-20</a>). By claiming every animal for His altar, the LORD cuts off demonic worship.<p>&#8211; It also reminds the people that every blessing, even the meat they eat, belongs to Him first (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical take-aways:<p>&#8226; Worship is never a private invention; it must follow God&#8217;s revealed pattern.<p>&#8226; The LORD lovingly interrupts our routines to keep our hearts fixed on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><p>&#8211; God centers worship at the Tent, the place where His glory dwells (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>).<p>&#8211; Bringing the animal &#8220;to the priest&#8221; underscores mediation; sinful humans approach God through an ordained representative (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The &#8220;entrance&#8221; is significant: the worshiper remains outside the holy space while the priest carries the blood within (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-5</a>). This preserves God&#8217;s holiness and the worshiper&#8217;s life (<a href="/leviticus/16-1.htm">Leviticus 16:1-2</a>).<p>&#8211; Cross references reinforce the theme of centralized, priest-mediated worship: <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>; <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>.<p>&#8211; Life application:<p>&#8226; Approach God through His appointed Mediator, Jesus Christ, not by self-made pathways.<p>&#8226; Gather with the covenant community rather than offering isolated &#8220;field&#8221; worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and offer them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD</b><p>&#8211; The peace offering (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; 7:11-21) celebrates fellowship restored. Part of the animal is burned for God, part is given to the priest, and part is enjoyed by the giver.<p>&#8211; By requiring every peace offering to pass through His altar, the LORD ensures that true peace comes only on His terms (<a href="/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8211; The shared meal anticipates the greater table of communion with Christ (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Peace with God produces shared joy with others; private religion robs the community of rejoicing.<p>&#8226; Thanksgiving belongs in God&#8217;s presence first; every celebration should acknowledge His provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5</a> commands Israel to relocate their formerly private sacrifices to the LORD&#8217;s altar, under priestly supervision, and to present them specifically as peace offerings.

It follows that the command refers to sacrifice, not to mere slaughtering. Clark, taking the opposite view of the command, is obliged to change the translation, <span class="accented">sacrifices which they offer in the open field</span>, into "beasts for slaughter which they now slaughter in the open field" ('Speaker's Commentary'); but he has no authority for doing so. <span class="accented">Zabach</span> means always, in the Pentateuch, to slay in sacrifice. These field sacrifices, when offered to the Lord in the proper place and with the proper ceremonies, would become peace offerings unto the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/17-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For this reason</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4616.htm">Strong's 4616: </a> </span><span class="str2">Purpose -- intent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
