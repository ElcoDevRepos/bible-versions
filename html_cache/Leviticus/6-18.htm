This exclusivity underscores the sanctity and the hereditary nature of the priesthood, as established in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>. The male descendants of Aaron were set apart for priestly duties, and this privilege of eating the offerings signifies their role in mediating between God and the Israelites. The consumption of the offerings by the priests symbolizes their participation in the sacrificial system, which foreshadows the ultimate priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is described as our High Priest in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>This is a permanent portion from the food offerings to the LORD for the generations to come.</b><br>The term "permanent portion" indicates the enduring nature of this ordinance. It was not a temporary measure but a lasting statute for the priestly line. The food offerings, which included grain offerings and portions of animal sacrifices, were a means of sustaining the priests who served in the tabernacle and later the temple. This provision reflects God's care for those who minister in His name, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul references the support of those who preach the gospel. The phrase "for the generations to come" emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with Israel and the perpetual nature of the priestly duties until the coming of Christ, who fulfills and transcends the Old Testament sacrificial system.<p><b>Anything that touches them will become holy.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the concept of holiness and the transfer of sanctity through contact. In the ancient Near Eastern context, holiness was often associated with separation and purity. The idea that anything touching the offerings becomes holy underscores the sacredness of the offerings and the seriousness of approaching God. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The holiness of the offerings points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, whose holiness and righteousness are imputed to believers, making them holy in God's sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a central figure in the establishment of the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_aaron.htm">Sons of Aaron</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were designated as priests to serve in the tabernacle and later in the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_made_by_fire.htm">Offerings Made by Fire</a></b><br>Sacrifices presented to God, often involving burnt offerings, which were a central part of Israelite worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god's_offerings.htm">The Holiness of God&#8217;s Offerings</a></b><br>The offerings made by fire were considered holy, and only those consecrated (the priests) could partake in them.

Any priest who ate the most holy things outside the wall of the courts, or the less holy things outside of the walls of Jerusalem, received forty stripes save one.<p><span class= "bld">Every one that toucheth them shall be holy.</span>--According to this rendering, which exhibits one of the views that obtained during the second Temple, the meaning is that any one who touches the sacrifices of the first order of holiness must not only be a descendant of Aaron and a male, but must have sanctified himself by undergoing the necessary ablutions. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/22-6.htm" title="The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>.)
