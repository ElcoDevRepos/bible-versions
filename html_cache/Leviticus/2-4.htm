It was distinct from animal sacrifices and symbolized the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to the Lord. The use of an oven indicates a more refined preparation process, suggesting a personal and deliberate act of worship. In ancient Israel, ovens were typically communal and made of clay, reflecting the communal aspect of worship and daily life.<p><b>it must consist of fine flour</b><br>Fine flour was a luxury item, representing the best of one's produce. It signifies offering God the highest quality of what one has, reflecting the principle of giving God the first and best.

Oil was also used for anointing, pointing to consecration and the presence of God.<p><b>or unleavened wafers coated with oil</b><br>Unleavened wafers, thinner and more delicate than cakes, emphasize humility and simplicity in offerings. The coating with oil further underscores the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification and empowerment. This imagery can be connected to the anointing of Jesus Christ, the "Anointed One," who was without sin and filled with the Spirit (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).

After the vessel is thoroughly heated, the dough, which is made into large, thin, oval cakes resembling pancakes or Scotch oatcakes, is dexterously thrown against the sides, the aperture above is covered, and the bread is completely baked in a few minutes.
