The LORD, or Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, highlighting His relationship with Israel. Moses and Aaron are central figures in the Exodus narrative, with Moses as the leader and prophet, and Aaron as the high priest. This dual address underscores the importance of both leadership and priesthood in conveying and implementing God's laws. The context is the wilderness period after the Exodus, where God is establishing a holy community. This communication is part of the Holiness Code, which outlines how Israel is to live as God's chosen people. The phrase sets the stage for the detailed laws concerning ritual purity, which are crucial for maintaining the sanctity of the community and the tabernacle. This divine instruction reflects God's desire for order and holiness among His people, a theme that resonates throughout the Pentateuch and is echoed in the New Testament call for believers to be holy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate authority and lawgiver for the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, who plays a crucial role in the religious leadership and rituals of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority.htm">Divine Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that the laws and instructions given in Leviticus come directly from God, emphasizing His sovereignty and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership.htm">Role of Leadership</a></b><br>Understand the importance of godly leadership as exemplified by Moses and Aaron, who were chosen to guide the Israelites in spiritual and practical matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>Leviticus 15 deals with issues of cleanliness, reminding us of the need for spiritual purity and the separation from sin in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/communication_with_god.htm">Communication with God</a></b><br>Reflect on the privilege of having direct access to God through prayer and His Word, as Moses and Aaron did in their time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>Consider how the laws given to Moses and Aaron were meant to maintain the health and holiness of the entire community, highlighting our responsibility to care for one another in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_15_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 15:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_1_God_s_purity_focus.htm">How does Leviticus 15:1 emphasize God's concern for purity and holiness?
