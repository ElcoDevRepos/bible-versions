In ancient Israel, priests were expected to maintain a level of holiness that reflected their sacred duties. The prohibition against marrying a woman involved in prostitution underscores the importance of sexual purity and the avoidance of relationships that could compromise the priest's sanctity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>, "Be holy, because I am holy."<p><b>or divorced by her husband</b><br>The restriction against marrying a divorced woman highlights the importance of marital fidelity and the sanctity of marriage. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, divorce could carry a stigma, and a divorced woman might be seen as having a compromised status. This regulation ensured that priests maintained a reputation of integrity and holiness. The New Testament also addresses the sanctity of marriage in passages like <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, where Jesus speaks against divorce, reinforcing the idea of marriage as a lifelong covenant.<p><b>for the priest is holy to his God</b><br>This phrase underscores the unique role of the priest as set apart for God's service. The concept of holiness is central to the priestly identity, as priests were consecrated to perform sacred duties and rituals. This holiness was not only a personal attribute but also a reflection of their divine calling. The idea of being "holy to his God" is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), indicating that all Christians are set apart for God's purposes. The priest's holiness serves as a type of Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who is perfectly holy and mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of this verse is on the priests, who were set apart for service to God in the Israelite community.
