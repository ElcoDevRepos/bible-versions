Animals with hooves not completely divided were considered unclean because they did not meet the criteria set by God for consumption. This distinction served as a physical reminder of the spiritual separation between the Israelites and the surrounding pagan cultures. The divided hoof is symbolic of discernment and separation, reflecting the need for the Israelites to be set apart in holiness.<p><b>or that does not chew the cud</b><br>Chewing the cud refers to the process of ruminating, where animals regurgitate their food to chew it again. This characteristic was another criterion for clean animals. The act of chewing the cud can symbolize meditation on God's Word, as it involves a repetitive and thoughtful process. This requirement emphasizes the importance of internalizing and reflecting on spiritual truths, much like the meditative practices encouraged in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>.<p><b>is unclean for you</b><br>The designation of certain animals as unclean was not merely about physical health but had a deeper spiritual significance. It was a means of teaching the Israelites about purity and obedience to God's commands. The concept of uncleanness is prevalent throughout Leviticus and serves as a metaphor for sin and separation from God. The Israelites were called to be holy, as God is holy (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>), and adhering to these dietary laws was a part of that calling.<p><b>Whoever touches any of them will be unclean</b><br>Touching an unclean animal rendered a person ceremonially unclean, requiring purification rituals to restore their status. This underscores the pervasive nature of sin and the need for atonement and cleansing. The requirement for purification points forward to the ultimate cleansing provided by Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice purifies believers from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).

Nothing escapes His notice; He is the Creator who knows each creature (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10&#8211;11</a>). This universal statement underscores that God, not human preference, sets the boundaries of what is clean and unclean (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With hooves not completely divided</b><p>Split hooves serve as a visible sign. A hoof that is only partially split illustrates incompleteness&#8212;an outward reminder that partial obedience never satisfies God&#8217;s standard (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). Compare the requirement for entirely split hooves with <a href="/deuteronomy/14-6.htm">Deuteronomy 14:6</a>, reinforcing the same guideline, and note how precision matters when God defines holiness (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or that does not chew the cud</b><p>Chewing the cud pictures internal processing&#8212;taking in, bringing up again, and thoroughly breaking down nourishment.

Both visible (hooves) and internal (cud) traits are required; one without the other is insufficient, echoing Jesus&#8217; warning against whitewashed appearances without inner purity (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is unclean for you</b><p>Unclean animals were not &#8220;bad&#8221; in themselves; God simply set them apart to teach Israel discernment and dependence on His revelation (<a href="/leviticus/20-25.htm">Leviticus 20:25&#8211;26</a>). The distinction protected health, marked Israel as separate from surrounding nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>), and pointed forward to the need for holiness in every sphere of life (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever touches any of them will be unclean</b><p>Contact transfers ceremonial defilement, highlighting how impurity spreads easily (<a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>). This principle warned Israel to guard association and remain vigilant (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>). Yet God also made provision: anyone who became unclean could be restored through His prescribed washings and sunset waiting (<a href="/leviticus/11-31.htm">Leviticus 11:31&#8211;32</a>). Ultimately, Christ fulfills these laws by cleansing all who come to Him (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/11-26.htm">Leviticus 11:26</a> teaches that God sets precise standards for His people, using the clear signs of a fully split hoof and cud-chewing to illustrate complete, internalized obedience. Anything less renders an animal&#8212;and symbolic&#173;ally, a life&#8212;unclean. Touching what is unclean spreads defilement, reminding believers to heed God&#8217;s definitions of holiness and rely on His provided means of cleansing, now fully realized in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">The carcases of every beast.</span>--The construction of this text constituted one of the differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees during the second Temple. According to the Pharisees, or the National Church in the time of Christ, the phrase "that toucheth <span class= "ital">them</span>" in the last part of this verse refers to "the carcases" of the unclean animals spoken of in the preceding verse. It was only when an unclean animal was dead, whether death was owing to natural causes, design, or accident, that contact with its body defiled (see <a href="/leviticus/11-8.htm" title="Of their flesh shall you not eat, and their carcass shall you not touch; they are unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-31.htm" title="These are unclean to you among all that creep: whoever does touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:31</a>); but when alive, unclean animals were freely used. Hence camels, asses, horses, &c, were employed in daily life, though unclean (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-40.htm" title="Moreover they that were near them, even to Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.">1Chronicles 12:40</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-15.htm" title="And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.">Zechariah 14:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-2.htm" title="Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.">Matthew 21:2</a>; <a href="/luke/13-15.htm" title="The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?">Luke 13:15</a>, &c.). The Authorised Version rightly expresses this sense by inserting "the carcases" in italics at the beginning of the verse, thus showing that "them" in the latter part of the verse refers to the bodies of unclean animals when dead. Indeed some MSS. have actually "that toucheth their carcases," instead of "that toucheth them." The Sadducees, however, took the expression "them" to refer to the living unclean animals, and hence maintained that touching the body of any animal described in this dietary list as unclean defiled. The difference which this interpretation of the text produced in the domestic life and social intercourse of the Jews can hardly be described, since, according to the doctrine of the Sadducees, it was exceedingly difficult to remain undefiled as soon as one of them stepped outside their dwellings. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1469;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
