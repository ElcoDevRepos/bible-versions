The family unit was central to societal structure, and maintaining its integrity was crucial. The term "dishonor" implies a violation of familial respect and order. In the broader biblical context, honoring one's family is a recurring theme, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The patriarchal society of ancient Israel placed significant emphasis on the male lineage, and any act that could disrupt this lineage was strictly prohibited.<p><b>by approaching his wife</b><br>The act of "approaching" here is a euphemism for engaging in sexual relations. This prohibition is part of a larger set of laws in <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> that outline forbidden sexual relationships, emphasizing the sanctity of marriage and the boundaries set by God. The wife of the father's brother is considered part of the extended family, and any sexual relationship with her would be seen as an intrusion into the marital covenant, which is sacred and inviolable.<p><b>to have sexual relations with her</b><br>This phrase explicitly states the nature of the prohibited act. Sexual relations outside the bounds of marriage, especially within the family, were seen as defiling and corrupting. The Levitical laws were given to set the Israelites apart from the surrounding nations, many of which practiced forms of sexual immorality. This commandment underscores the call to holiness and purity, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God commands His people to be holy as He is holy.<p><b>she is your aunt</b><br>The identification of the woman as "your aunt" highlights the close familial relationship and the inherent respect and boundaries that should exist within it. This relationship is not just a social construct but a divinely ordained order. The term "aunt" signifies a familial bond that should be honored and protected. In the broader biblical narrative, family relationships are often used to illustrate spiritual truths, such as the church being the family of God (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>). This commandment serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining purity and respect within the family, reflecting God's order and design for human relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as a guide for holy living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people with practices God deemed abominable.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/father's_brother.htm">Father&#8217;s Brother (Uncle)</a></b><br>A family member whose wife is specifically mentioned in this law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aunt.htm">Aunt</a></b><br>The wife of the father&#8217;s brother, whom the law protects from sexual relations with her nephew.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_boundaries.htm">Respect for Family Boundaries</a></b><br>This law underscores the importance of respecting family relationships and maintaining boundaries to preserve family honor and integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The call to avoid such relationships is part of a broader call to holiness, as God&#8217;s people are to be set apart from the surrounding nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Engaging in prohibited relationships can lead to personal and communal consequences, as seen in other biblical accounts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_distinction.htm">Cultural Distinction</a></b><br>The Israelites were to live differently from the Canaanites, whose practices were contrary to God&#8217;s design for human relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_to_modern_life.htm">Application to Modern Life</a></b><br>While the specific cultural context has changed, the principle of honoring family relationships and maintaining sexual purity remains relevant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_14_Family_boundaries_today.htm">How does Leviticus 18:14 guide us in respecting family boundaries today?
