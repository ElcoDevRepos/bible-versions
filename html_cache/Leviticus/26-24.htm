In the context of <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, God outlines the blessings for obedience and the consequences for disobedience. The use of "hostility" suggests a reversal of the protective and nurturing relationship God desires with His people. Historically, this reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where blessings and curses were part of the agreement (Exodus 19-24). Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate rebellion. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and the prophetic warnings in books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>and I will strike you sevenfold for your sins</b><br>The term "sevenfold" signifies completeness or fullness, a common biblical motif indicating totality. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the number seven often represented perfection or completion. This phrase suggests that the punishment will be thorough and complete, matching the severity of the people's sins. Theologically, it reflects the principle of divine justice, where the punishment corresponds to the offense. This idea is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of forgiveness "seventy times seven" (<a href="/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>), indicating the boundless nature of grace, contrasting with the completeness of judgment here. The concept of divine retribution is also seen in Revelation, where judgments are poured out in a complete and final manner.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His response to the disobedience of the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's covenant and the ones being warned about the consequences of their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The location where God delivered the laws and commandments to Moses, including the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites and the mediator of God's laws and commandments to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which includes blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a personal failing but a breach of the covenant with God.
