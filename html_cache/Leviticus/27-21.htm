During the Jubilee, land that had been sold was to be returned to its original family owners. This reflects God's ownership of the land and His desire for economic balance and social justice. The Jubilee year is a reminder of God's provision and the importance of rest and renewal. It also foreshadows the ultimate liberation and restoration found in Christ, who proclaimed the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-19.htm">Luke 4:19</a>).<p><b>it will become holy</b><br>The term "holy" signifies something set apart for God. In the context of Leviticus, holiness is a central theme, emphasizing the distinctiveness of God's people and their possessions. When the field becomes holy, it is dedicated to God's purposes, indicating a transfer from common use to sacred use. This reflects the broader biblical principle that all creation is ultimately for God's glory and service.<p><b>like a field devoted to the LORD</b><br>Fields devoted to the LORD were considered irrevocably given to God, often through a vow or dedication. Such fields could not be redeemed or sold, as they were permanently set apart for divine purposes. This devotion underscores the seriousness of vows and the importance of fulfilling commitments to God. It also highlights the idea that what is given to God is not to be taken lightly, reflecting the call to wholehearted devotion.<p><b>it becomes the property of the priests</b><br>The priests, as mediators between God and the people, were responsible for the sacred duties of the tabernacle and later the temple. They did not have a tribal inheritance like the other tribes of Israel, as their inheritance was the LORD (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>). Thus, the property given to the priests supported their ministry and service. This provision ensured that those who served in spiritual capacities were cared for, a principle echoed in the New Testament regarding the support of those in ministry (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jubilee_year.htm">The Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society occurring every 50th year, where land and property were returned to original owners, and debts were forgiven.

When that fiftieth&#8208;year trumpet sounds, a field once leased or pledged reverts, not to its former owners, but to God Himself. Declared holy and devoted, the land passes into priestly hands, funding continual worship and reminding Israel that all property ultimately belongs to the Lord. The verse reveals God&#8217;s justice in restoring families, His sovereignty in owning the land, and His provision for those who serve at His altar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile.</span>--That is, when it quits the hand of the purchaser, since in jubile every buyer was to part with the land which he bought, (see <a href="/context/leviticus/25-25.htm" title="If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.">Leviticus 25:25-28</a>)--<p><span class= "bld">Shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field devoted.</span>--It shall not revert to the original owner who first vowed it and, after refusing to redeem it, fraudulently sold it, but becomes God's property, like all devoted or banned things.
