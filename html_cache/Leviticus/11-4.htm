The criteria for clean animals are that they must both chew the cud and have a divided hoof. This law is part of the Holiness Code, which sets Israel apart from other nations. The distinction between clean and unclean animals is symbolic of spiritual purity and separation from sin. This separation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be distinct from the world (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof;</b><br>Camels were common in the ancient Near East and were valuable for transportation and trade. Despite chewing the cud, camels do not have a fully divided hoof, which disqualifies them as clean animals. This specific prohibition highlights the importance of adhering to God's standards rather than human logic. The camel's partial conformity to the clean animal criteria serves as a reminder that partial obedience is not sufficient in God's eyes. This principle is reflected in <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>, which states that breaking one part of the law is akin to breaking all of it.<p><b>it is unclean for you.</b><br>The designation of the camel as unclean underscores the concept of holiness and separation. In the cultural context of the Israelites, being unclean meant being ritually impure and unfit for worship. This law served to remind the Israelites of their covenant relationship with God and their call to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The concept of uncleanness is further developed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes internal purity over external rituals (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>). The dietary laws, while no longer binding under the New Covenant (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), still teach valuable lessons about obedience and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including dietary laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom the dietary laws were given as part of the covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the dietary restrictions found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/camel.htm">Camel</a></b><br>An animal specifically mentioned in this verse as unclean due to its lack of a split hoof, despite chewing the cud.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_law.htm">Levitical Law</a></b><br>The body of laws given to the Israelites, including dietary restrictions, to set them apart as God's holy people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>The dietary laws were given to set the Israelites apart as a holy nation.

The first animal adduced to illustrate this fact is the indispensable camel, or "the ship of the desert," as it is aptly called. Though cloven-footed above, the toes of the camel are united below in a large elastic pad on which the camel treads, and which is like the sole of a shoe. Hence it does not come within the category of those animals which are thoroughly bisulcate. The Egyptians, the Zebii, and the Hindus, too, did not eat camel's flesh, because they supposed it to be heating, and to engender cruelty and revenge; whilst the Persians, the ancient Arabians, and the Moslems feasted upon its milk and flesh.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that chew</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
