The breasts and the right thigh were portions of the peace offering, which symbolized fellowship and thanksgiving. The act of waving signified presenting the offering to God and acknowledging His provision. This ritual was part of the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests, marking their official service to God. The wave offering also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God, fulfilling the law and establishing a new covenant.<p><b>as Moses had commanded</b><br>Moses, as the mediator of the Old Covenant, received direct instructions from God regarding the sacrificial system and the consecration of the priesthood. His command ensured that the rituals were performed according to divine ordinance, maintaining the holiness and order required by God. This obedience to God's command highlights the importance of following divine instructions precisely, a theme that runs throughout Scripture. It also points to Jesus, who perfectly fulfilled the law and the prophets, obeying the Father in every aspect of His earthly ministry.
