The sin offering was a critical component of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and maintain the holiness of the community. The goat, as a sin offering, was to be eaten by the priests in a holy place, symbolizing the bearing of the people's sins. This search indicates Moses' diligence in upholding God's commands, reflecting the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>and behold, it had been burned up</b><br>The burning of the sin offering outside the camp was reserved for specific circumstances, such as when the blood was brought into the sanctuary (<a href="/leviticus/6-30.htm">Leviticus 6:30</a>). The fact that the goat was burned instead of eaten suggests a deviation from the prescribed ritual. This act could symbolize the complete removal of sin, but in this context, it indicates a failure to follow God's instructions. The burning up of the offering without the priests partaking in it could signify a loss of the intended fellowship and atonement.<p><b>He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron&#8217;s remaining sons</b><br>Eleazar and Ithamar, as Aaron's surviving sons, were responsible for carrying out the priestly duties after the death of their brothers Nadab and Abihu, who were consumed by fire for offering unauthorized incense (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). Moses' anger reflects the gravity of their oversight or disobedience. The priesthood was a sacred office, and any deviation from God's commands was taken seriously, as it could lead to dire consequences for the community. This incident underscores the importance of obedience and reverence in worship.<p><b>and asked</b><br>Moses' questioning of Eleazar and Ithamar highlights the need for accountability among the leaders of Israel. It also serves as a teaching moment, emphasizing the importance of understanding and adhering to God's laws. This inquiry is not just about seeking an explanation but also about reinforcing the sanctity of the priestly duties and the sacrificial system.

His anger springs from zeal for exact obedience, yet his ensuing dialogue with Aaron balances justice with compassion.
