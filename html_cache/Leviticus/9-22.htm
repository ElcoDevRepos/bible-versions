Aaron, as the high priest, performed this act to convey God's favor and peace upon the Israelites. This blessing signifies the completion of the sacrificial rituals and the acceptance of the offerings by God. The act of blessing is reminiscent of the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>, where God instructs Aaron and his sons on how to bless the Israelites. This moment foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest, who intercedes and blesses His people (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25-26</a>).<p><b>And having made the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering,</b><br>These offerings were central to the Levitical sacrificial system. The sin offering was for atonement and purification from sin, highlighting the need for repentance and forgiveness. The burnt offering symbolized complete dedication to God, as the entire animal was consumed by fire. The peace offering, also known as the fellowship offering, represented reconciliation and communion with God. Together, these offerings illustrate the comprehensive nature of atonement and worship in Israelite religion. They prefigure the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills all these offerings through His death and resurrection, providing complete atonement and peace with God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<p><b>he stepped down.</b><br>This phrase indicates the conclusion of the sacrificial ceremony. Aaron stepping down signifies the completion of his priestly duties at the altar. It also marks the transition from the sacrificial act to the reception of God's presence and blessing. In a broader theological sense, this act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, after offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice, ascended to the Father and now intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). The stepping down also emphasizes the accessibility of God's presence to the people, as the high priest mediates between God and Israel, a role ultimately fulfilled by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
