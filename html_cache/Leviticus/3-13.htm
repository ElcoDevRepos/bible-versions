It signifies identification with the sacrifice, acknowledging that the animal is taking the place of the sinner. This foreshadows the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity. The laying on of hands is also seen in other contexts, such as the ordination of priests (<a href="/numbers/8-10.htm">Numbers 8:10</a>) and the commissioning of leaders (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>).<p><b>and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting.</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was where God&#8217;s presence dwelled among His people. The act of slaughtering the animal here underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement before approaching a holy God. This prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who was crucified outside the city gates (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), fulfilling the sacrificial system.<p><b>Then Aaron&#8217;s sons shall splatter its blood on all sides of the altar.</b><br>The priests, Aaron&#8217;s sons, were responsible for performing the sacrificial rites. The splattering of blood on the altar signifies purification and consecration, as blood was considered the life force (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This act represents the cleansing power of the sacrifice, pointing to the blood of Christ, which cleanses believers from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).
