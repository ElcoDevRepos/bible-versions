The concept of firstfruits is deeply rooted in Israelite agricultural society, where the first yield of the harvest was dedicated to God as a sign of gratitude and trust in His continued provision (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). This offering symbolizes the principle of giving God the first and best of what one has, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). The firstfruits also foreshadow Christ as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep, indicating His resurrection as the first of many (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><b>but they must not go up on the altar as a pleasing aroma</b><br>This part of the verse specifies that while firstfruits can be offered to the LORD, they are not to be burned on the altar like other offerings. The pleasing aroma typically refers to burnt offerings, which symbolize atonement and reconciliation with God (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). The restriction here highlights the distinct purpose of firstfruits, which are more about dedication and thanksgiving rather than atonement. This distinction underscores the varied ways in which offerings were used to express different aspects of worship and relationship with God. The prohibition also points to the unique role of Christ, whose sacrifice alone is the ultimate pleasing aroma to God, fulfilling all the sacrificial requirements (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the recipient of the offerings and worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are given the laws and instructions for worship and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_of_firstfruits.htm">Offerings of Firstfruits</a></b><br>These are the initial yield of the harvest, dedicated to God as a sign of gratitude and acknowledgment of His provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The sacred place where offerings are made to God, symbolizing His presence and the place of atonement and worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet through whom God delivered the laws and instructions to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_firstfruits.htm">Understanding Firstfruits</a></b><br>The offering of firstfruits is an act of worship and acknowledgment of God's provision and sovereignty.

Yet verse 12 immediately balances that command: &#8220;You may bring them to the LORD&#8230;&#8221; In other words, the Lord is not forbidding His people to approach Him with these gifts; He is simply directing how they are to be presented.<p>&#8226; This echoes God&#8217;s earlier invitation to bring the &#8220;best of the firstfruits of your land to the house of the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By allowing the approach, God affirms that every good thing&#8212;leavened bread for daily meals or honey for sweetness&#8212;belongs under His lordship (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The emphasis is relational. Israelites were free to draw near with the ordinary produce of life as long as they followed the pattern God revealed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As an offering of firstfruits</b><p>The qualifying phrase is vital: yeast and honey may come only &#8220;as an offering of firstfruits.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Firstfruits were the very first portion of a harvest, dedicated to God before anyone else enjoyed the crop (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-1.htm">Deuteronomy 26:1-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Giving the first signaled trust: God, You provided this harvest; we believe You will supply the rest (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; In some festivals, leavened loaves actually had to be waved before the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>). Those loaves were never burned; they were set apart for priestly consumption (<a href="/leviticus/23-20.htm">Leviticus 23:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament picks up the theme: Christ is &#8220;the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). Just as the firstfruits guaranteed the remaining harvest, Christ&#8217;s resurrection guarantees ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But they must not go up on the altar</b><p>Although yeast and honey could be presented, they were never to be burned.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Every grain offering you present to the LORD must be made without yeast&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaven ferments and spreads, often serving in Scripture as a picture of corruption (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Honey caramelizes and can produce smoke; together with leaven it would distort both the appearance and the aroma of the sacrifice.<p>&#8226; God distinguished between gifts enjoyed by priests and offerings wholly consumed on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15-18</a>). Burnt offerings pointed to total consecration; therefore anything symbolizing corruption was excluded.<p>&#8226; The restriction underscores that worship must follow God&#8217;s pattern, not personal preference (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a pleasing aroma</b><p>Only sacrifices meeting God&#8217;s specifications &#8220;rise as a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Pleasing&#8221; speaks of divine satisfaction, not human nostrils.<p>&#8226; When yeast or honey is present, the symbolism of perfect, untainted devotion is lost. The sacrifice no longer reflects the holiness of the One receiving it.<p>&#8226; Ultimately, every acceptable offering foreshadows Christ, who &#8220;loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). His sinless life fulfilled what every aroma-offering only hinted at.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a> teaches that God welcomes every part of our lives&#8212;represented by everyday items like leavened bread and honey&#8212;yet He also sets boundaries for how those gifts approach His holiness. Yeast and honey could be offered as firstfruits, expressing gratitude and trust, but they could not be burned on the altar, lest symbols of corruption mingle with the picture of total, flawless devotion. The verse balances invitation with reverence, pointing ahead to the perfect, pleasing aroma of Christ&#8217;s sacrifice that fulfills every offering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">As for the oblation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as an oblation of firstfruits ye may offer them. </span>This verse mentions an exception to the rule laid down in the previous one. <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>leaven and honey, which are excluded from the meat offerings, may be used with firstfruits.
