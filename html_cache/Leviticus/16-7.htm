These goats are central to the atonement ritual, symbolizing the removal of sin from the community. The use of two goats highlights the dual aspects of atonement: one for sacrifice and one as the scapegoat. This practice underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for divine intervention for forgiveness. The two goats can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills both roles: the sacrificial offering and the bearer of sins.<p><b>and present them before the LORD</b><br>The act of presenting the goats before the LORD signifies offering them to God, acknowledging His sovereignty and holiness. This presentation is a formal act of dedication, emphasizing that the ritual is conducted under divine authority. It reflects the biblical principle that all offerings and sacrifices are ultimately made to God, who alone can forgive sins. This foreshadows Christ's presentation before God as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It served as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a sacred space where significant rituals and divine encounters occurred. Presenting the goats at this location underscores the importance of the ritual and the need for the community to approach God with reverence and obedience. This setting prefigures the access believers have to God through Christ, who is the true Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest who performs the rituals of the Day of Atonement, including the presentation of the goats.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_goats.htm">Two Goats</a></b><br>Central to the Day of Atonement ritual; one is sacrificed, and the other is sent into the wilderness as the scapegoat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, before whom the goats are presented as part of the atonement process.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God meets with His people, and where the rituals of atonement are performed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>An annual event in the Jewish calendar dedicated to atonement and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The Day of Atonement highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for a mediator between God and humanity.

The scene spotlights substitution, cleansing, and divine fellowship, all fulfilled perfectly in Christ, our great High Priest and once-for-all sacrifice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And he shall take the two goats.</span>--Having presented his own sin-offering, the high priest, accompanied by the two chief priests, now came to the north of the altar. Here the one of his companions who was next in rank to the pontiff placed himself at his right side, whilst the other, who held the office of chief of the principal household (see <a href="/1_chronicles/24-6.htm" title="And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:6</a>), stood at his left. It was here that the two goats were presented with their faces to the west, where the Holy of Holies was, and where the Divine majesty was especially revealed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It must be carefully noted that. as the two goats made one sin offering (verse 5), so they are both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> By this solemn presentation they became the Lord's, one as much as the other. After this, Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">cast lots upon the two goats.</span> The two goats, of the same size and appearance as far as possible, stood together near the entrance of the court. And by them was an urn containing two lots. These the high priest drew out at the same moment, placing one on the head of one goat, the other on the head of the other goat. According as the lot fell. one of the goats was taken and at once offered to the Lord, with a view to being shortly sacrificed; the other was appointed for a scapegoat, and reserved till the expiatory sacrifices had been made, when it too was offered to the Lord, and then sent away into the wilderness. After the lot had been chosen, the two goats were distinguished from each other by having a piece of scarlet cloth tied, the first round its neck, the second round its horn. <span class="cmt_word">One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</span> The last word is in the original <span class="accented">la-azazel</span>, and being found only in this chapter, it has caused a great discrepancy of opinion among interpreters as to its meaning. It has been diversely regarded as a place, a person, a thing, and an abstraction. The first class of interpreters explain it as some district of the wilderness; the second understand by it an evil spirit; the third take it as a designation of the goat; the fourth translate it, "for removal." The first interpretation may be summarily rejected. If a localized spot were meant, that spot would have been left behind by a people constantly on the move. The second hypothesis - that <span class="accented">azazel</span> was an evil spirit, or the evil spirit - has been embraced by so considerable a number of modern expositors, that it is necessary to dwell upon it at some length. But, indeed, it has little to recommend it. It has been argued that <span class="accented">azazel</span> must be a proper name, because it has no article prefixed to it, <span class="accented">la-azazel.</span> This is a grammatical error. When a noun expresses an office or a function, and has the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> or <span class="accented">la</span> prefixed to it, it does not take an article in Hebrew any more than in French; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the verse, "Jehu... shalt thou anoint to be king (or for king) over Israel; and Elisha... shalt thou appoint to be prophet (or for prophet) in thy room" (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), the Hebrew is <span class="accented">le-melek</span> and <span class="accented">le-navi</span>, without the article. The same idiom will be found in <a href="/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>. With greater plausibility it is argued that verse 8 contrasts Jehovah and Azazel, and that if <span class="accented">la-Yehovah</span> be translated "for Jehovah," or "for the Lord," <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> must be translated "for Azazel." It may be allowed that there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> likelihood that, where words are thus contrasted, if one designates a person, the other would designate a person. But it is an incredibly rash assertion that this is always the case. All depends upon the idea which the speaker or writer has in his mind and desires to express. As part of the same argument, it is urged that the preposition, being the same in both clauses of the sentence, must be translated by the same word. This is certainly not the case. The natural meaning of <span class="accented">le</span> with a proper name is "for," and with a word expressing the performance of some function (technically called <span class="accented">nomen agentis</span>) it means "to be" (see the passage quoted above from <a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). Unless, therefore, <span class="accented">azazel</span> be a proper name (which has to be proved, not assumed)the preposition need not and ought not to be translated by "for" but by "to be." The word <span class="accented">le</span> is used with great latitude, and often in a different sense in the same sentence; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>. The objections to the theory that <span class="accented">azazel</span> means an evil spirit are of overwhelming force. It will be enough to name the following. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The name <span class="accented">azazel</span> is nowhere else mentioned. This could not be, if he were so important a being as to divide with Jehovah the sin offering of the congregation of Israel on the great Day of Atonement. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> No suitable etymology can be discerned. The nearest approach to it is very forced - "the separated one." <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The notion of appeasing, or bribing, or mocking the evil spirit by presenting to him a goat, is altogether alien from the spirit of the rest of the Mosaic institutions.
