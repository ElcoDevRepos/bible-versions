The Year of Jubilee, occurring every 50th year, was a time of liberation and restoration, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>. This period was significant because it ensured that no Israelite would be permanently enslaved, reflecting God's desire for freedom and equality among His people. The counting of time emphasizes the temporary nature of servitude and the hope of redemption. This concept parallels the spiritual redemption offered through Christ, who liberates believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years,</b><br>The valuation of the servant's remaining time until the Jubilee was calculated based on the years left, ensuring fairness in the transaction. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and equity, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>, which also addresses the treatment of servants. The economic system in Israel was designed to prevent perpetual poverty and to promote social stability. This principle of fair valuation can be seen as a type of Christ's sacrificial atonement, where the price paid for humanity's redemption was perfectly just and sufficient.<p><b>based on the daily wages of a hired hand.</b><br>The reference to daily wages indicates that the servant's labor was valued similarly to that of a hired worker, ensuring dignity and respect for the individual. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of fair treatment for all workers, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>, which condemns the withholding of wages. The daily wage system reflects the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where labor was often compensated on a daily basis. This system underscores the importance of fair compensation and the recognition of each person's contribution, echoing the New Testament teaching that "the laborer deserves his wages" (<a

verse opens with a shared calculation, emphasizing that both parties stand before God under the same standard of justice.<p>&#8226; This mutual counting prevents exploitation and keeps the process transparent (see <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle reflects <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>, where the servant&#8217;s term is clearly defined, and echoes Jesus&#8217; call to mutual fairness in <a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>.<p>&#8226; By involving the servant in the math, the Lord guards his dignity; he is not property to be managed in secret but a covenant brother whose rights must be openly respected (<a href="/leviticus/25-17.htm">Leviticus 25:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the year he sold himself</b><p>The clock starts at the point of voluntary indenture, a response to poverty rather than criminal penalty (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant chose this path to survive, similar to the widow&#8217;s plight in <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1-7</a>.<p>&#8226; Marking the exact year prevents adding hidden time and reminds Israel that hardship has a measurable limit (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-18.htm">Deuteronomy 24:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God never forgets the beginning of a trial, and neither should His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Up to the Year

25:10</a>).<p>&#8226; However long the servant has left, Jubilee guarantees freedom, land restoration, and a fresh start.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a> and <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a> connect this release to the Messiah&#8217;s ministry, showing God&#8217;s heart for liberation.<p>&#8226; Every calculation moves toward hope; oppression ends on God&#8217;s schedule, not man&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years</b><p>Value is prorated, not arbitrary.<p>&#8226; If twenty years remain until Jubilee, the buyer pays more; if two, far less&#8212;mirroring the sliding scale in <a href="/leviticus/27-16.htm">Leviticus 27:16-18</a>.<p>&#8226; This guards against profiteering while compensating the purchaser for lost labor, balancing mercy and responsibility.<p>&#8226; It teaches fairness in all business dealings (<a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Based on the daily wages of a hired hand</b><p>God equates the servant&#8217;s value to that of a free laborer, not livestock.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus
