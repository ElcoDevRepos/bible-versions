The "name of the LORD" signifies God's character and authority. In ancient Israel, God's name was considered sacred and inviolable, reflecting His holiness and the covenant relationship with His people. This command underscores the seriousness of maintaining reverence for God, as seen in the Third Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p><b>must surely be put to death;</b><br>The death penalty for blasphemy highlights the gravity of the offense in the theocratic society of Israel. It served as a deterrent to prevent the community from falling into idolatry or disrespecting God. This reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, emphasizing purity and reverence. The severity of the punishment underscores the importance of God's holiness and the need for the community to uphold it.<p><b>the whole assembly must surely stone him,</b><br>Stoning was a communal act, involving the entire assembly, which reinforced the collective responsibility of the community to uphold God's laws. This method of execution was public and served as a powerful deterrent. It also ensured that the community was united in maintaining the sanctity of God's name, as seen in other instances of communal judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>).<p><b>whether he is a foreign resident or native;</b><br>This phrase indicates that God's laws applied equally to everyone within the community, regardless of their origin. It reflects the inclusive nature of God's covenant, where both Israelites and foreigners living among them were subject to the same standards of holiness. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation and God's laws are extended to all people (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>if he blasphemes the Name,</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the seriousness of the offense. "The Name" is a metonym for God Himself, indicating the deep respect and reverence required for God's identity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the power and sanctity of God's name, as seen in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>).<p><b>he must be put to death.</b><br>The reiteration of the death penalty underscores the unchanging nature of God's justice and the importance of upholding His holiness. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for atonement, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the penalty for sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, representing His holiness and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The assembly of the Israelites, responsible for upholding God's laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_resident.htm">Foreign Resident (Ger)</a></b><br>A non-Israelite living among the Israelites, subject to the same laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/blasphemer.htm">Blasphemer</a></b><br>An individual who speaks irreverently or disrespectfully about God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stoning.htm">Stoning</a></b><br>A method of capital punishment used in ancient Israel for certain transgressions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_name.htm">Reverence for God's Name</a></b><br>God's name is holy and should be treated with the utmost respect.

<a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a> for New-Covenant church discipline).<p>&#8226; Shared action also created powerful deterrence: &#8220;All Israel will hear and be afraid&#8221;
