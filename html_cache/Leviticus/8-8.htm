The breastpiece, also known as the breastplate of judgment, was an essential part of the high priest's garments, signifying his role in representing the people before God. The breastpiece was made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, as described in <a href="/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15-30</a>. It was a square, double-folded piece of fabric that held the Urim and Thummim. The breastpiece's placement over the heart symbolized the high priest's duty to carry the tribes of Israel before the Lord continually.<p><b>and placed the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece</b><br>The Urim and Thummim were mysterious objects used for divination, to discern God's will in specific situations. Their exact nature is unknown, but they were likely stones or lots kept in the breastpiece. The Urim and Thummim were used to obtain divine guidance, as seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>. They represent God's provision for guidance and decision-making for His people. Theologically, they foreshadow the perfect guidance believers receive through the Holy Spirit. The placement of the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece underscores the high priest's role as a mediator between God and Israel, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, our eternal High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is performing the consecration ceremony for Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, who is being consecrated as the high priest of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/breastpiece.htm">Breastpiece</a></b><br>A sacred garment worn by the high priest, containing the Urim and Thummim, used for discerning God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/urim_and_thummim.htm">Urim and Thummim</a></b><br>Objects placed in the breastpiece, used for divine decision-making and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_ceremony.htm">Consecration Ceremony</a></b><br>A significant event where Aaron and his sons are set apart for priestly service, symbolizing their dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_high_priest.htm">The Role of the High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest served as a mediator between God and the people, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate priesthood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>The Urim and Thummim symbolize the importance of seeking divine guidance in decision-making, reminding us to seek God's will in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_and_holiness.htm">Consecration and Holiness</a></b><br>The consecration of Aaron and his sons emphasizes the need for holiness and dedication in serving God, applicable to all believers as a royal priesthood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_breastpiece.htm">Symbolism of the Breastpiece</a></b><br>The breastpiece represents carrying the people of God close to the heart, a reminder for leaders to care for those they serve.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_high_priest.htm">Christ as Our High Priest</a></b><br>Jesus, our High Priest, provides us with direct access to God, eliminating the need for intermediaries like the Urim and Thummim.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_8_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 8:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_8_8_Priestly_garments_role.htm">How does Leviticus 8:8 illustrate the importance of priestly garments in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Urim_Thummim_God_s_will_significance.htm">What is the significance of the Urim and Thummim in discerning God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_breastpiece_Lev_8_8_to_Eph_6_14.htm">How does the breastpiece in Leviticus 8:8 connect to Ephesians 6:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Using_divine_guidance_daily_2.htm">How can we apply the concept of divine guidance in our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_obeying_God_crucial_in_Lev_8_8.htm">Why is obedience to God's instructions crucial, as demonstrated in Leviticus 8:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Urim_and_Thummim_s_role_in_Lev_8_8.htm">What is the significance of the Urim and Thummim in Leviticus 8:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_8_8_s_link_to_high_priest_role.htm">How does Leviticus 8:8 relate to the role of the high priest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_place_Urim_Thummim_in_breastpiece_2.htm">Why were the Urim and Thummim placed in the breastpiece of judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_urim_and_thummim.htm">What are the Urim and Thummim?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_reliable_is_the_urim_and_thummim_claim.htm">Exodus 28:30: How reliable is the claim about the Urim and Thummim, given the lack of concrete archeological evidence or consistent references elsewhere?
