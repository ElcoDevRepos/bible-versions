The act of putting blood on the horns of the altar signifies the transfer of sin and the need for atonement. The altar of fragrant incense, located in the Holy Place, symbolizes the prayers and intercessions of the people rising to God. The horns, often seen as symbols of power and strength, represent the authority of the altar to atone for sin. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood would be shed for the atonement of humanity's sins.<p><b>that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting.</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. It was a sacred space where God met with Moses and the priests. The phrase "before the LORD" emphasizes the presence of God and the holiness required in approaching Him. This setting underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of purification before entering God's presence. The Tent of Meeting prefigures the coming of Christ, who would become the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<p><b>And he is to pour out the rest of the bull&#8217;s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering</b><br>The altar of burnt offering, located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle, was where sacrifices were made to God. Pouring out the blood at its base signifies the complete offering of life, as blood represents life in biblical symbolism. This act of pouring out the blood is a vivid reminder of the cost of sin and the need for a substitute to bear the penalty. It points forward to the sacrifice of Jesus, whose blood was poured out for the forgiveness of sins, fulfilling the requirements of the law.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</b><br>The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a place of transition from the common to the sacred. It was here that the people could approach God through the mediation of the priest. This location highlights the accessibility of God through the prescribed means of sacrifice and atonement. In the New Testament, Jesus declares Himself as the "door" (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>), indicating that He is the way through which believers can enter into the presence of God, fulfilling the symbolism of the Tabernacle's entrance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_fragrant_incense.htm">The Altar of Fragrant Incense</a></b><br>Located in the Tent of Meeting, it symbolizes the prayers and intercessions of the people rising to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites, serving as the center of worship and sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bull.htm">The Bull</a></b><br>Represents the sin offering, a sacrifice made to atone for unintentional sins of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">The Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>Situated at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, where sacrifices were made to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as an intermediary, highlighting the need for a mediator between sinful humanity and a holy God.

According to the practice which obtained in the time of Christ, the priest began by putting the blood first on the north-east horn, then on the north-west, then on the south-west, and, lastly, on the south-east horn. He dipped his finger in the blood of the bowl at the sprinkling of each horn, and wiped his finger on the edge of the bowl between the separate sprinklings, as the blood which remained on his finger from one horn was not deemed fit to be put on the other.<p><span class= "bld">And shall pour all the blood.</span>--That is, all the remaining blood. The bulk of the blood which remained, after expending the small quantity on the horns of the incense altar inside the sanctuary, the priest poured out at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering, which stood outside the holy place.
