Priests acted as mediators between God and the people, performing rituals that symbolized the removal of sin. The concept of atonement involves covering or cleansing sin, allowing the individual to be reconciled with God. This process foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who is described in the New Testament as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The phrase "before the LORD" emphasizes the divine presence in the tabernacle or temple, where sacrifices were offered. This setting underscores the holiness required in approaching God, a theme consistent throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>and he will be forgiven</b><br>Forgiveness in the Old Testament is closely tied to the sacrificial system, where the shedding of blood was necessary for the remission of sins (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This forgiveness was not just a legal pardon but a restoration of the relationship between the individual and God. The assurance of forgiveness provided hope and peace to the Israelites, pointing forward to the complete forgiveness available through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The Hebrew concept of forgiveness also includes the idea of lifting or carrying away sin, which is fulfilled in the New Testament by Jesus, who "takes away the sin of the world" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>for anything he may have done to incur guilt.</b><br>The phrase "anything he may have done" indicates the comprehensive nature of the atonement provided. It covers all types of transgressions, whether intentional or unintentional. The law given to Israel was detailed and specific, and the sacrificial system provided a means to address various kinds of guilt. This reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring that no sin was too great to be forgiven if the prescribed atonement was made. The concept of guilt in the Old Testament is not only a legal status but also a moral and spiritual condition that affects one's standing before God. This comprehensive forgiveness is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are assured that "if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between the people and God, performing the rituals necessary for atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, who provides the means for forgiveness and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual who has committed a sin or incurred guilt and seeks atonement through the prescribed offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the offerings and rituals are performed, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process by which reconciliation between God and man is achieved, involving a sacrificial offering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's role as a mediator foreshadows Christ's ultimate priesthood.
