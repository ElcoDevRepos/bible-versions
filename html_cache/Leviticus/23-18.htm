This feast is a time of thanksgiving for the harvest and is one of the three pilgrimage festivals where Israelites were to appear before the Lord in Jerusalem.<p><b>you are to present seven unblemished male lambs a year old</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible. The requirement for the lambs to be unblemished signifies the need for purity and perfection in offerings to God, reflecting the holiness He demands. The age of one year indicates the lambs are in their prime, symbolizing strength and vitality.<p><b>one young bull</b><br>The bull is a symbol of strength and service. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, bulls were often associated with deities and used in significant religious rituals. The inclusion of a bull in the offering underscores the importance of the sacrifice and the need for a substantial offering to God.<p><b>and two rams</b><br>Rams are often associated with leadership and sacrifice. In the context of sacrificial offerings, rams were used in various significant biblical events, such as the ram provided by God in place of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). The number two may symbolize witness or testimony, reinforcing the communal aspect of the offering.<p><b>They will be a burnt offering to the LORD</b><br>A burnt offering is one that is completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God. This type of offering is meant to atone for sin and express devotion. The complete consumption by fire signifies the complete giving over of the offering to God.<p><b>together with their grain offerings and drink offerings</b><br>Grain offerings, often made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolize the fruit of human labor and dedication to God. Drink offerings, typically wine, represent joy and celebration. Together, these offerings complement the burnt offering, creating a holistic act of worship that includes both sustenance and celebration.<p><b>a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The phrase "pleasing aroma" is a metaphorical expression indicating that the offering is acceptable and pleasing to God. It reflects the idea that God is satisfied with the worship and obedience of His people. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), drawing a parallel between the Old Testament sacrifices and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the laws and instructions given by God through Moses.

Here, verse 18 adds animal offerings &#8220;along with the bread,&#8221; showing that worship is never piecemeal; God asks for both grain and animal sacrifices in unified devotion. The pattern echoes <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, where daily lambs accompanied grain and drink. Likewise, <a href="/numbers/15-1.htm">Numbers 15:1-10</a> ties meat, grain, and drink together, reminding Israel that every part of life&#8212;harvest and herd&#8212;belongs to the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are to present seven unblemished male lambs a year old</b><p>Seven signifies completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-3</a>). Year-old lambs picture prime vitality, unstained and perfect, pointing forward to Christ, &#8220;a lamb without blemish or spot&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The annual Pentecost celebration thanked God for the full wheat harvest; seven lambs underscored that gratitude must be complete. Compare the seven lambs offered daily during the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-16</a>); God consistently calls His people to total consecration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One young bull</b><p>A bull, larger and costlier than a lamb, heightens the sense of sacrifice. <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a> prescribes bulls for new-moon offerings, and <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-26</a> for unintentional national sin, pointing to strength and substitution. Including a bull here proclaims that thanksgiving still needs atonement; wealth and strength must bow before God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And two rams</b><p>Rams often signify dedication. In <a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-26</a> two rams inaugurated priestly ministry&#8212;the ram of ordination and the ram whose blood was applied to ear, thumb, and toe. Pentecost celebrated covenant renewal; two rams remind Israel that their hearing, working, and walking must remain devoted to their Redeemer (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will be a burnt offering to the LORD</b><p>A burnt offering is wholly consumed (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). Nothing is held back, symbolizing total surrender. Pentecost fell fifty days after Passover; the people who were redeemed in Egypt now present themselves entirely to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>). <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a> shows Jesus fulfilling the burnt-offering ideal, offering His body once for all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with their grain offerings and drink offerings&#8212;a food offering</b><p>Grain and drink (wine) accompany every animal sacrifice (<a href="/numbers/15-1.htm">Numbers 15:1-10</a>).

The emphasis on aroma highlights that God seeks heartfelt obedience, not mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). Christ&#8217;s self-offering is &#8220;a fragrant aroma&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), guaranteeing that believers&#8217; sacrifices of praise (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>) are likewise pleasing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/23-18.htm">Leviticus 23:18</a> unites grain, drink, lambs, rams, and a bull into one Pentecost package, portraying total gratitude, atonement, and dedication.
