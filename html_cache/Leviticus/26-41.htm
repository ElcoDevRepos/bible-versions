In the context of <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, God outlines the blessings for obedience and the consequences for disobedience. Acting with hostility signifies divine judgment, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament, where God disciplines His people to bring them back to righteousness (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). This hostility is not arbitrary but a response to Israel's repeated idolatry and rebellion, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges.<p><b>and brought them into the land of their enemies</b><br>This refers to the exile of the Israelites, a historical event where they were taken captive by foreign powers such as Assyria and Babylon. The land of their enemies symbolizes both a physical and spiritual separation from God's promises. The exile serves as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah, who cautioned that disobedience would lead to such consequences. This displacement is also a type of spiritual exile, representing the separation from God due to sin.<p><b>and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled</b><br>The term "uncircumcised hearts" is a metaphor for spiritual stubbornness and impurity. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, and an uncircumcised heart indicates a lack of true commitment to God. Humility here is a prerequisite for repentance and restoration. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, where God calls for a circumcision of the heart, pointing to an inward transformation rather than mere outward compliance. It foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on heart transformation through Christ (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>).<p><b>and they will make amends for their iniquity</b><br>Making amends involves confession, repentance, and a turning back to God. This is a key aspect of the covenant relationship, where acknowledgment of sin and seeking forgiveness leads to restoration. The sacrificial system in Leviticus points to the need for atonement, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The call to make amends is a call to return to God, aligning with the prophetic messages of restoration and hope found in books like Hosea and Joel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is speaking to the Israelites, expressing His response to their disobedience and the conditions for restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who are being addressed in this passage, having experienced exile due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies'_land.htm">Enemies' Land</a></b><br>The foreign lands where the Israelites were exiled as a consequence of their rebellion against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncircumcised_hearts.htm">Uncircumcised Hearts</a></b><br>A metaphor for the Israelites' spiritual stubbornness and rebellion against God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/amends_for_iniquity.htm">Amends for Iniquity</a></b><br>The process of repentance and seeking forgiveness for their sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's hostility towards the Israelites was a direct result of their disobedience.

Earlier in the chapter the Lord warns, &#8220;I will set My face against you&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>), a theme echoed when &#8220;the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40</a>).<p>&#8226; This hostility is not capricious; it is the righteous response of a holy God to persistent rebellion, just as in <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a> where the people &#8220;rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit, so He turned and became their enemy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The severity highlights God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to His word&#8212;both in blessing and in judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Brought them into the land of their enemies</b><p>&#8226; Exile was the climactic covenant curse. &#8220;The LORD will drive you, and the king you set over you, to a nation unknown to you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>). History records the fulfillment: the northern tribes to Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>) and Judah to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in judgment, God preserved a remnant (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>), proving His covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Exile served as both punishment and a severe mercy, stripping away idols and reminding the people that life apart from God&#8217;s presence is bondage (<a href="/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled</b><p>&#8226; Physical circumcision marked Israel, yet God continually aimed at the heart: &#8220;Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and stiffen your necks no more&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Humility is the gateway to restoration. &#8220;If My people&#8230; humble themselves, pray, seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; An &#8220;uncircumcised heart&#8221; pictures stubbornness. When that heart is humbled, the barrier to fellowship is removed, fulfilling <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, &#8220;I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will make amends for their iniquity</b><p>&#8226; Confession and repentance are required, not mere remorse.

The passage calls every believer to heed both the warning of judgment and the promise of forgiveness, embracing heartfelt repentance that leads to renewed fellowship with the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">And that I also have walked contrary unto them.</span>--That is, and they shall also confess that through their walking contrary unto God, He also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies.<p><span class= "bld">If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled.</span>--Better, or rather, <span class= "ital">their uncircumcised</span> <span class= "ital">hearts shall be humbled. </span>This is a resumption of the statement made at the beginning of <a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm" title="If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;">Leviticus 26:40</a>, viz., "And they shall confess their iniquity . . . ;" or rather, <span class= "ital">their uncircumcised hearts shall be humbled. </span>That is, perverse and stubborn hearts; too proud to make an humble confession. (See <a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>, with <a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>.) The same metaphor is used by the Apostle: "Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Accept of the punishment of their iniquity.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">accept willingly, </span>that is, they will acknowledge the justice of their punishment, and be in that frame of mind when they will freely own that the punishment is not commensurate with their guilt, and willingly accept the Divine retribution. The exact shade of meaning covered by this phrase in the original cannot adequately be given in a translation, since the verb here translated "accept," or "accept willingly," is the same which is translated "enjoy" in <a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>. The whole phrase denotes literally, <span class= "ital">they shall rejoice in their iniquity, </span>or <span class= "ital">in the punishment of their iniquity; </span>they will take it joyfully, as the best and most appropriate means to bring them to repentance. The nearest approach to it is the passage, "I will bear the indignation of the Lord, for I have sinned against him" (<a href="/micah/7-9.htm" title="I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.">Micah 7:9</a>). . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/26-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">acted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1461;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with hostility</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;qe&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
