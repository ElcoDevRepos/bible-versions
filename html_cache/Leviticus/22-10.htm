In the context of Leviticus, the sacred offerings were portions of sacrifices designated for the priests, who served as mediators between God and the Israelites. This restriction underscores the separation between the holy and the common, a recurring theme in Leviticus. The priesthood, originating from Aaron's lineage, was set apart for specific duties, and this exclusivity highlights the importance of maintaining purity and reverence in worship practices. This principle of separation can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of the priesthood of all believers, where spiritual purity and dedication are emphasized.<p><b>nor may the guest of a priest</b><br>The mention of a guest, or sojourner, indicates that even those who might be temporarily residing with a priest are not permitted to partake in the sacred offerings. This reflects the broader cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where hospitality was highly valued, yet boundaries regarding sacred practices were strictly maintained. The guest, though welcomed into the priest's home, does not share in the priestly privileges. This distinction reinforces the idea that access to the sacred is not merely a matter of proximity or association but is determined by divine ordinance.<p><b>or his hired hand eat it</b><br>The inclusion of a hired hand, or servant, further delineates the boundaries of who may partake in the sacred offerings. In ancient Israel, hired hands were often non-Israelites or individuals without a permanent status within the community. This restriction highlights the importance of covenant identity and the special role of the priestly family in the religious life of Israel. The hired hand, despite being part of the household economy, does not share in the covenantal privileges. This can be seen as a type pointing to the New Testament, where Jesus Christ, as the ultimate High Priest, extends the invitation to partake in the sacred through faith, transcending ethnic and social boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, set apart to perform the duties of the tabernacle and later the temple.

The privilege of eating holy food was not a community potluck; it was a family meal reserved for those in covenant priestly lineage. Just as Aaron&#8217;s sons alone could approach the altar (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>), only the priest&#8217;s household could touch the table. God protects holiness by limiting access. The principle still stands: spiritual benefits flow through covenant relationship, not casual association&#8212;echoed later when Jesus says, &#8220;You must be born again&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may eat the sacred offering</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;may eat the sacred offering&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>b) refers to portions of grain, peace, sin, and guilt offerings set apart for priestly consumption (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; 6:16&#8211;18; 7:31&#8211;34). Eating these gifts signified both sustenance and partnership in sacrificial worship. Because the offering was &#8220;most holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-10.htm">Leviticus 2:10</a>), any profane contact would desecrate it, as illustrated when Nadab and Abihu died for unauthorized fire (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>). God&#8217;s people learn that sacred things remain sacred even after the ceremony ends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor may the guest of a priest</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;nor may the guest of a priest&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>c) widens the fence. A visitor sleeping under the same roof&#8212;however welcomed&#8212;could not claim priestly privileges. Passover carried a similar restriction: &#8220;A temporary resident or hired servant may not eat it&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-45.htm">Exodus 12:45</a>). Hospitality is good, but holiness is guarded. Later, David as a guest received consecrated bread only under exceptional circumstances and with strict conditions (<a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4&#8211;6</a>), showing just how rare such exceptions were.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or his hired hand eat it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;or his hired hand eat it&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>d) highlights the difference between a servant and a son. A day-laborer could be trusted with temple chores (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-28.htm">1 Chronicles 9:28</a>) yet still lacked family status. This distinction foreshadows Jesus&#8217; contrast: &#8220;The hired hand&#8230;is not the shepherd&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>). In God&#8217;s economy, relationship&#8212;not wages&#8212;grants access to holy food. Spiritual life cannot be bought, earned, or worked for; it is received by birthright in God&#8217;s household (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a> teaches that God draws firm lines around His holiness, allowing only covenant family members to share in sacred provisions. The rule protected Israel&#8217;s worship, pointed toward the necessity of belonging to God&#8217;s household, and ultimately anticipates the New Covenant reality that only those born into God&#8217;s family through Christ partake of the true Bread of Life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing.</span>--By "stranger" here is meant a non-Aaronite who was a stranger to the priestly family, though he was an Israelite, or even a Levite.

(See <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a>.) Neither of them was the property of the priest, though his labour and services belonged to him. As these Hebrew servants could not be bought with money like a heathen slave, they were treated like strangers, or non-Aaronites, and hence were not permitted to partake of the holy food.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> - The previous paragraph having forbidden the priests to eat of the holy things while in a state of ceremonial uncleanness, naturally leads to the question, who has the right of eating them? The answer is, the priest's family. The members of the priest's family here specified are those only about whom any question might have arisen, namely, the slaves, who, as bring incorporated into the priest's household, have a right of eating of the priestly food not enjoyed by lodgers in his house or by servants hired with his money; and married daughters who have returned to their father's roof in consequence of the death of their husband, or of being divorced, without any children of their own. Under these circumstances, it is ruled that they become once more a part of the priest's family, and able to exercise the privileges of that position. The priest's wife and sons and unmarried daughters are not here mentioned, as no question arose about them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/22-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
