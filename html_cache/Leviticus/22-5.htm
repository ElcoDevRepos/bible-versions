This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity. The prohibition underscores the Israelites' call to be distinct from surrounding nations, who may not have observed such dietary and purity laws.<p><b>or a person that makes him unclean</b><br>Contact with a person who is ceremonially unclean could result from various conditions, such as skin diseases (Leviticus 13-14) or bodily discharges (Leviticus 15). This highlights the communal aspect of purity laws, where individual impurity could affect the entire community's ability to worship. The New Testament echoes this concern for purity, but with a focus on internal rather than external cleanliness, as seen in Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>.<p><b>whatever the uncleanness may be&#8212;</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of the purity laws, covering all possible sources of uncleanness. It reflects the meticulous nature of the Levitical code, which aimed to maintain the sanctity of the Israelites as God's chosen people. The emphasis on thoroughness in avoiding uncleanness points to the holiness of God and the need for His people to approach Him with reverence and purity. This foreshadows the ultimate purification through Christ, who fulfills the law and offers cleansing from all sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary audience of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/22.htm">Leviticus 22</a>, the priests were responsible for maintaining ritual purity to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/crawling_creatures.htm">Crawling Creatures</a></b><br>Refers to certain animals considered unclean under Mosaic Law, which could defile a person upon contact.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_persons.htm">Unclean Persons</a></b><br>Individuals who were ceremonially unclean due to various reasons, such as skin diseases or bodily discharges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where God's presence dwelled and where the priests performed their duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time by which a person who became unclean could be considered clean again, marking the end of the day in Jewish tradition.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity_and_holiness.htm">Ritual Purity and Holiness</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus highlight the importance of holiness and separation from sin.
