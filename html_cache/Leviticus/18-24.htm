The term "defile" suggests a corruption or pollution of moral and spiritual integrity. In the context of <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>, these practices refer to various sexual sins and idolatrous customs prevalent among the surrounding nations. The call to avoid defilement is consistent with the broader biblical theme of holiness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>, where God commands His people to be holy because He is holy. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to His laws is a sign of faithfulness and dedication.<p><b>for by all these things the nations</b><br>The "nations" mentioned here refer to the Canaanite peoples inhabiting the Promised Land before the arrival of the Israelites. These nations were known for their morally corrupt practices, which included not only sexual immorality but also child sacrifice and other forms of idolatry. The biblical narrative often contrasts the behavior of the nations with the standards God sets for His people, highlighting the distinctiveness of Israel's calling. This distinction is further emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-6</a>, where God instructs Israel to separate themselves from the nations to avoid being led astray.<p><b>I am driving out before you</b><br>This phrase indicates God's active role in the conquest of Canaan. The driving out of the nations is both a divine judgment against their wickedness and a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). Theologically, this reflects God's sovereignty and justice, as He uses Israel as an instrument of His judgment. The conquest narrative in the book of Joshua provides a historical account of this process, where God's intervention is evident in battles such as the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6).<p><b>have defiled themselves</b><br>The nations' defilement is a result of their persistent engagement in sinful practices, which ultimately leads to their downfall. This serves as a warning to Israel about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of adhering to God's commandments. The concept of defilement is not only physical but also spiritual, affecting the relationship between God and His people. The New Testament echoes this theme, where believers are called to live pure and holy lives, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>. The defilement of the nations also foreshadows the ultimate need for redemption through Jesus Christ, who provides cleansing from sin and restores the relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, God's chosen people, who are being instructed on how to live a holy life distinct from other nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land that God promised to the Israelites, which was inhabited by nations practicing the abominations listed in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who conveyed God's laws and instructions to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land of Canaan, whose practices were considered defiling and abominable by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who is giving these commands to ensure His people remain holy and set apart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be distinct from the world.
