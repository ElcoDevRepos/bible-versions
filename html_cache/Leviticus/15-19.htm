In the ancient Near Eastern context, bodily discharges were often associated with impurity, not as a moral failing but as a ritual state. The discharge of blood is a normal biological process, yet it was seen as a state of ritual impurity in the Israelite community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of distinguishing between the holy and the common, the clean and the unclean, as seen in Leviticus.<p><b>she will be unclean due to her menstruation for seven days</b><br>The period of seven days corresponds to the typical length of a menstrual cycle. The concept of being "unclean" is not about sinfulness but about ritual purity. This period of uncleanness required separation from certain religious activities and communal interactions. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. This period allowed for a complete cycle of purification.<p><b>and anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening</b><br>This regulation extended the state of ritual impurity to those who came into contact with the woman during her menstruation. The evening marked the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing a fresh start and the restoration of purity. This reflects the communal nature of purity laws, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the community and the importance of maintaining holiness. The concept of evening purification is also seen in other contexts, such as in <a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-25</a> regarding contact with unclean animals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, forming the community of God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/menstrual_impurity.htm">Menstrual Impurity</a></b><br>A state of ritual impurity associated with a woman's menstrual cycle, as described in the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for teaching and enforcing the laws of purity among the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws of Leviticus highlight the importance of holiness and separation from impurity, teaching us about God's standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_blood.htm">Symbolism of Blood</a></b><br>Blood, often associated with life and covenant, also represents impurity in certain contexts, pointing to the need for atonement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_contamination.htm">Community and Contamination</a></b><br>The laws emphasize the impact of individual impurity on the community, reminding us of our interconnectedness and responsibility to one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_fulfillment_of_the_law.htm">Christ's Fulfillment of the Law</a></b><br>Jesus' life and sacrifice fulfill the purity laws, offering us a deeper understanding of spiritual cleanliness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_holiness.htm">Practical Holiness</a></b><br>While the specific laws may not apply today, the principle of living a life set apart for God remains relevant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_15_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 15:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_19_on_purity_holiness.htm">How does Leviticus 15:19 address the concept of ritual purity and holiness?

Scripture candidly acknowledges the realities of life, affirming that the God who created the female body (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>) also establishes guidelines for caring for it.<p>&#8226; This discharge is simply menstruation, a recurring sign of God-given fertility (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of blood immediately connects to the broader biblical theme that &#8220;the life of the flesh is in the blood&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Because blood symbolizes life, its loss calls for special attention and ceremonial handling (<a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing everyday matters, the Lord shows He is concerned with all of life, from temple worship to household routines (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She will be unclean due to her menstruation for seven days</b><p>The term &#8220;unclean&#8221; throughout Leviticus describes a temporary ceremonial status, not a statement of moral guilt.<p>&#8226; For seven days&#8212;matching the usual length of a menstrual cycle&#8212;the woman refrains from entering the sanctuary or handling holy things (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>).<p>&#8226; This period allows for rest and recovery, reflecting God&#8217;s care for physical well-being (<a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The set time also teaches the community about God&#8217;s holiness: every aspect of life must be approached with reverence (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar seven-day intervals are prescribed after childbirth (<a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2</a>) and certain skin conditions (<a href="/leviticus/13-5.htm">Leviticus 13:5</a>), reinforcing a pattern of completeness and restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening</b><p>The uncleanness can spread by contact, illustrating how quickly impurity travels and why separation matters.<p>&#8226; Evening marks a fresh ceremonial start; after sunset and washing (<a href="/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5</a>), a person can rejoin regular activities.<p>&#8226; This brief defilement underscores communal responsibility: everyone must guard both personal and collective holiness (<a href="/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle foreshadows Christ&#8217;s work: while impurity once spread by touch, Jesus reverses it, cleansing the unclean (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a> treats menstruation with dignity, setting a seven-day ceremonial boundary that honors God&#8217;s holiness, protects community worship, and offers practical rest. Touching the woman during this time conveys temporary uncleanness, teaching Israel to respect life-bearing blood and anticipate the greater cleansing fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And if a woman have an issue.</span>--Having legislated for cases in connection with man--as well as for one case in which both the husband and the wife are concerned, the Law now lays down directions for two cases affecting the woman.<p><span class= "bld">And her issue in her flesh be blood.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">if her issue, </span>&c. This clause defines the preceding one, stating more minutely what the issue consists of and proceeds from.<p><span class= "bld">She shall be put apart seven days.</span>--Though as a rule the discharge ceases after three or four days, yet, as in the first stage after childbirth, the period of uncleanness is extended to seven days to include exceptional cases. (See <a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.">Leviticus 12:2</a>.) To fully appreciate the merciful provisions of the laws here enacted, it is necessary to bear in mind not only the gross superstitions which obtained among the ancients about women in this condition, but the cruel treatment to which wives and daughters were subjected, and in some countries both in the Old and New Worlds still are subjected. It was believed that if a woman in this condition sat under a tree, all its fruit fell off; at her approach the edge of a tool became blunted, and copper utensils contracted a fetid smell, and meat got sour, and a thousand other things. Hence the Parsees not only isolated her from the rest of the family, but forbade her speaking to any one, and those who took food to her in her seclusion had to put it at some distance from her. The Zabii purified with fire every place which she trod. Even if the wind which came from the quarter where she was blew upon any one, he became polluted. To this day the  in Issing, the Calmucks, and many others, have special houses for them outside each town and village; and at the River La Plata they are sewn into hammocks, with only a small aperture for the mouth, till they are well again. To restrain the Jews from sharing these superstitions, and from resorting to any of these inhuman acts, as well as for sanitary purposes, the Lawgiver ordained these benign and necessary rules.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean.</span>--Like other unclean persons, she defiled by being touched. Though not expressed here, it is implied that he who contracted this defilement had both to wash his garments and bathe his body as usual.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-24.</span> - The fourth case of an issue - that of ordinary menstruation (cf. <a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2</a>;
