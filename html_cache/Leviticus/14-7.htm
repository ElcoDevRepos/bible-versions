Sprinkling seven times signifies a complete purification process. The act of sprinkling is a ritualistic cleansing, symbolizing the removal of impurity and sin. In the context of Leviticus, skin diseases, often translated as leprosy, rendered a person ceremonially unclean, separating them from the community and worship. This ritual allowed for reintegration. The sprinkling with blood and water prefigures the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>, where the blood of Christ purifies our conscience.<p><b>Then he shall pronounce him clean</b><br>The priest's role was crucial in declaring someone clean, emphasizing the importance of spiritual authority and community validation in the restoration process. This pronouncement was not just a physical declaration but a spiritual and communal one, allowing the individual to return to worship and society. It reflects the New Testament concept of forgiveness and restoration through Christ, who has the authority to cleanse us from sin (<a href="/mark/2-5.htm">Mark 2:5-12</a>).<p><b>and release the live bird into the open field.</b><br>The release of the live bird symbolizes freedom and new life, akin to the scapegoat in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, which carried away the sins of the people. This act signifies the complete removal of impurity and the restoration of the individual to a state of purity. The open field represents the vastness of God's grace and forgiveness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes our transgressions as far as the east is from the west. This imagery also points to the resurrection and ascension of Christ, who, after His sacrifice, ascended to heaven, symbolizing victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest is the central figure in the cleansing ritual, acting as the mediator between God and the person being cleansed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/person_to_be_cleansed.htm">Person to be Cleansed</a></b><br>This refers to the individual who has been afflicted with a skin disease, often translated as leprosy, and is seeking ritual purification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/live_bird.htm">Live Bird</a></b><br>One of two birds used in the cleansing ceremony; it is released into the open field as part of the ritual.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/open_field.htm">Open Field</a></b><br>The place where the live bird is released, symbolizing freedom and the removal of impurity from the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cleansing_ritual.htm">Cleansing Ritual</a></b><br>A ceremonial process prescribed by God for the purification of someone healed from a skin disease, involving specific actions and symbols.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_cleansing.htm">Symbolism of Cleansing</a></b><br>The ritual symbolizes the removal of impurity and restoration to community life.

The seven times symbolised the complete cleansing. (See <a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>.) Hence Naaman the leper washed himself seven times in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm" title="And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.">2Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm" title="Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like to the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.">2Kings 5:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And shall let the living bird loose.</span>--Whereupon the priest not only pronounced the cured man clean and restored to his liberty, but at the same time liberated the bird also. The release of the bird symbolised the freedom restored to the patient, who, like the bird, was now at liberty to go where he liked without any restraint. Because it is here said that the bird is to be let loose "into the open field," or, more literally, <span class= "ital">towards the face of the field, </span>the ancient canons decreed that he who lets it loose must not turn his face towards the sea, wilderness, or city, but towards the field. The cedar wood, the crimson thread, and the hyssop, as well as the bird, if caught again, could be used again in the cleansing of other lepers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times.</span> It is not certain whether the seven sprinklings were made upon the forehead of the person to be cleansed, or on the back of his hand. The feathers of the bird and the bunch of hyssop would be specially instrumental in the seven sprinklings. <span class="cmt_word">And shall pronounce him clean.</span> Having assured himself that he was healed (verse 3), the priest now pronounces him to be clean, he looses as well as binds. It had been his office to declare the man a leper, and thereby to shut him out from the people of the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/13-8.htm">Leviticus 13:8, 15, 22, 25, 36, 44, 46</a>). Now he pronounces him to be no leper, and therefore, after some further ceremonies, readmits him (verses 8, 20, 31). <span class="cmt_word">And shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</span> The symbolism of the two birds, which has been much misinterpreted, is essentially the same as that of the two goats on the day of atonement, though each ceremony has its distinctive features. The <span class="accented">killing</span> of the living bird was not a true sacrifice, as was the offering of the goat to Jehovah, but by its death it represented the state in which the leper had legally been, and to which he would have been physically reduced had not a remedy been found. The deathly and unclean state of the leper having been symbolically transferred from the dead bird to the living bird by the latter's being sprinkled in the former's blood, the living bird stands in the position of the scapegoat, on whom the sins of the people were laid. The bird is then <span class="accented">let loose into the open field</span>; literally, <span class="accented">upon the face of the field</span>; and it flies off, carrying with it the leper's uncleanness, and assuring him by every forward movement that it makes that the living death has passed from him, just as each step or' the scapegoat appeared to the Israelites to remove their sins from them. A large number of commentators, on the other hand, consider the released bird to symbolize the health and freedom now given back to the leper, and they dwell on the rapid and uncontrolled movement of birds as being peculiarly suitable for representing this recovered liberty. But this interpretation, to which there are many objections, appears to be altogether incompatible with the fact that the same ceremony is used in the cleansing of the leprous house, whereas the house could certainly not be represented as "recovered to unrestrained liberty" (Lunge). The common patristic view, that the two birds represent the two natures of the one Great Sacrifice offered to redeem man from sin, seems to be out of place here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">times</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6471.htm">Strong's 6471: </a> </span><span class="str2">A beat, foot, anvil, occurrence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he shall sprinkle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hiz&#183;z&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
