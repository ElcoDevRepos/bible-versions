The prohibition against charging interest, or usury, on loans to fellow Israelites reflects God's desire for His people to care for one another, especially the poor and needy. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, charging interest was common, but God set His people apart with this command. This principle is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>, highlighting the importance of community support and the avoidance of exploitation.<p><b>but fear your God</b><br>The fear of God is a central theme throughout the Bible, signifying reverence, awe, and obedience to His commandments. This phrase underscores that the motivation for ethical behavior, such as not charging interest, should stem from a deep respect for God. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," indicating that true understanding and righteous living start with acknowledging God's authority. This fear is not about terror but about recognizing God's holiness and justice, leading to a life that honors Him.<p><b>that your countryman may live among you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of Israelite society, where the well-being of each individual affects the whole community. The goal is to ensure that every member of the community can live with dignity and security. This reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, which Jesus later cites as the second greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). The idea is that by following God's laws, the Israelites create a society where everyone can thrive, prefiguring the kingdom of God where justice and compassion reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, including the instructions in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, which were given to guide their community life and ensure justice and compassion among them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.

The authorities during the second Temple defined the words which are translated "usury" (<span class= "ital">nesheck</span>) and "increase" (<span class= "ital">tarbith, </span>or <span class= "ital">marbith</span>) as follows: If a person lends to another a shekel worth four denarii, and gets in return five denarii, or if he lends him two sacks of wheat, and receives back three, this is usury. If one buys wheat for delivery at the market price of 25 denarii a measure, and when it rises to 30 denarii he says to the vendor, "Deliver me the wheat, for I want to sell it and buy wine," and the vendor replies," I will take the wheat at 30 denarii and give thee wine for it," though he has no wine, this is increase. The "increase" lies in the fact that the vendor has no wine at the time, and that he may possibly lose again by the rise in wine. Accordingly the former is a charge upon money, whilst the latter is on products.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(tiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">any interest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;&#353;e&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5392.htm">Strong's 5392: </a> </span><span class="str2">Interest on a, debt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or profit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;ar&#183;b&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
