The act of cutting the ram into pieces signifies the thoroughness and completeness required in sacrifices, symbolizing total dedication to God. This meticulous preparation reflects the seriousness of approaching God, as seen in other sacrificial instructions (<a href="/exodus/29-17.htm">Exodus 29:17</a>). The division of the animal can also be seen as a type of Christ, whose body was broken for humanity (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>).<p><b>and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat</b><br>Burning the offering was a way to transform the physical sacrifice into a pleasing aroma to the Lord, as described in <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>. The head, pieces, and fat represent the entirety of the animal, indicating that nothing was withheld from God. The burning of the fat, considered the best part, signifies offering the best to God, a principle echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>. This act of burning can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's complete sacrifice, where He gave Himself wholly for the atonement of sin (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div

cut</b><p>Moses, acting under God&#8217;s direct command, personally divides the sacrifice: &#8220;He cut the ram.&#8221; This hands-on action highlights that consecration is never theoretical&#8212;it is carried out in obedience (<a href="/leviticus/8-5.htm">Leviticus 8:5</a>). Just as Moses served as a mediator here, Christ would later become our perfect Mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). Both point to the same truth: God Himself provides and administers the way to draw near.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the ram</b><p>The animal is the second ram of ordination (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15&#8211;18</a>). A ram, strong and mature, pictures substitutionary strength&#8212;an innocent life offered for the guilty. In <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>, a ram foreshadows the ultimate Substitute, and <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> declares, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; By specifying &#8220;the ram,&#8221; God reinforces that consecration rests on a sacrifice He accepts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into pieces</b><p>The carcass is sectioned (compare <a href="/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6, 12</a>). Nothing remains whole; every part is exposed. The priesthood&#8212;and by extension every believer (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>)&#8212;is called to undivided surrender. God wants no hidden compartments; every relationship, motive, and habit must be placed on His altar (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and burned</b><p>Fire consumes what is placed upon it. In burnt offerings, nothing is eaten&#8212;everything ascends to God as &#8220;a pleasing aroma&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a> reminds us, &#8220;Our God is a consuming fire,&#8221; purifying and accepting what is wholly yielded. The priest&#8217;s ordination therefore becomes a public declaration: &#8220;All that I am is Yours.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the head</b><p>The head represents thought and will. By burning it, God claims the priest&#8217;s intellect, plans, and decisions (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>). Right ministry begins with minds renewed and aligned to divine truth (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the pieces</b><p>Every visible limb and muscle goes on the flames. Daily actions, skills, and service belong to the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>). The church today is &#8220;one body, many parts&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>), yet each part, like each piece of the ram, must be fully devoted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the fat</b><p><a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a> states, &#8220;All the fat belongs to the LORD.&#8221; Fat was the richest, choicest portion (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). Offering it teaches that God deserves the best, not leftovers (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). By burning the fat, the priest proclaims: &#8220;Your glory outweighs my comfort or abundance.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-20.htm">Leviticus 8:20</a> captures a vivid moment of total consecration. Moses cuts, distributes, and burns every part of the ram, dramatizing that those who serve God must yield mind, body, and best resources entirely to Him. The scene anticipates Christ&#8217;s complete self-offering and invites believers today to place every facet of life on the altar, confident that such wholehearted devotion rises as &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD.&#8221;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cut</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(nit&#183;ta&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5408.htm">Strong's 5408: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut up, cut in pieces, divide by joints</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the ram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
