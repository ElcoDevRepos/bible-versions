The distinction between clean and unclean animals is part of the broader Levitical law given to the Israelites to set them apart as God's chosen people. The crawling creatures mentioned here likely include various small animals and insects that move close to the ground. This classification is part of a larger system of dietary laws found in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which outlines what is permissible for the Israelites to eat. These laws served not only as a means of maintaining physical health but also as a symbol of spiritual purity and separation from the surrounding nations. The concept of clean and unclean animals is echoed in the New Testament, where Peter's vision in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a> challenges the early church to reconsider these distinctions in light of the new covenant in Christ.<p><b>Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.</b><br>The requirement for someone who touches a dead unclean animal to be considered unclean until evening underscores the importance of ritual purity in the daily life of the Israelites. This temporary state of uncleanness required the individual to undergo a purification process, which often included washing and waiting until evening, a time marker that signified a new day in the Hebrew calendar. This regulation highlights the pervasive nature of sin and impurity and the need for constant vigilance and cleansing. The evening purification can be seen as a type of the cleansing that comes through Christ, who provides ultimate purification from sin. The concept of being unclean until evening also points to the temporary nature of the old covenant's purification rituals, which are fulfilled and made complete in the sacrifice of Jesus, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>The primary recipients of the laws in Leviticus, tasked with communicating God's commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are given these laws to maintain holiness and purity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/swarming_creatures.htm">Swarming Creatures</a></b><br>Refers to various small animals and insects that move in large numbers, considered unclean under Mosaic Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the Law, emphasizing their journey and dependence on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus, including those about unclean animals, were given to set the Israelites apart as a holy nation.

By labeling them &#8220;unclean,&#8221; He is drawing a clear line between what His covenant people may associate with and what they must avoid (see <a href="/leviticus/20-25.htm">Leviticus 20:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>- This distinction served several purposes:<p>&#8226; It protected Israel from practices of surrounding nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminded them daily that God is holy and expects His people to live differently (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; It offered practical health benefits in a wilderness setting where sanitation was limited.<p>- The phrase &#8220;for you&#8221; personalizes the command. God&#8217;s moral and ceremonial standards were not abstract; they were directed to His chosen nation to set them apart (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>- While <a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11&#8211;15</a> shows that in Christ ceremonial food laws no longer bind the church, the principle of separation unto holiness still stands (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening</b><p>- Contact with a carcass created ritual impurity (<a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24</a>).

Touching a dead carcass imposed temporary uncleanness, highlighting humanity&#8217;s ongoing encounter with death and the need for divine cleansing. Today, while dietary restrictions are no longer obligatory in Christ, the passage still urges believers to recognize sin&#8217;s defilement and to pursue the purity God graciously provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">These are unclean.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">these are the most unclean, </span>as <a href="/leviticus/11-29.htm" title="These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,">Leviticus 11:29</a>.
