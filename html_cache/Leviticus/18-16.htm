In ancient Near Eastern cultures, family structures were central to societal stability, and violations of these boundaries were seen as threats to the community's moral fabric. This law underscores the sanctity of marriage and the need to honor the marital bond. In the New Testament, similar principles are echoed in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, where Paul addresses sexual immorality within the church, emphasizing the need for purity among believers.<p><b>that would shame your brother.</b><br>The concept of shame in this context relates to the honor-shame culture prevalent in the ancient Near East. Bringing shame upon a family member was a serious offense, as it could damage the family's reputation and standing within the community. This law highlights the importance of protecting one's family from disgrace and maintaining the honor of familial relationships. The idea of not shaming one's brother can also be seen in the broader biblical theme of loving one's neighbor and acting in ways that promote harmony and respect within the community. In the New Testament, Jesus teaches about the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness, which aligns with the principle of avoiding actions that would bring shame or harm to others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as a guide for holy living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people with practices that God deemed abominable.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother.htm">Brother</a></b><br>In this context, a fellow Israelite or literal sibling, whose marital relationship is to be respected.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother's_wife.htm">Brother&#8217;s Wife</a></b><br>The woman who is married to one's brother, whose relationship is protected by this commandment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_boundaries.htm">Respect for Family Boundaries</a></b><br>This commandment underscores the importance of respecting familial relationships and boundaries.

The command defends the sanctity of marriage, the purity of the family line, and the honor owed to one&#8217;s brother. Scripture consistently treats such a union as both adulterous and incestuous, bringing dishonor, personal ruin, and communal defilement. God&#8217;s people are called to uphold sexual purity, honor familial bonds, and love their neighbor&#8212;starting with those in their own household.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">The nakedness of thy brother's wife.</span>--Though alliance with a brother's wife is here forbidden--the prohibition, according to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, extending to illicit commerce or marriage in case she is divorced from her husband during the lifetime of her husband--and though the offenders are threatened with the curse of childlessness (see <a href="/leviticus/20-21.htm" title="And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.">Leviticus 20:21</a>), yet the law on this point is by no means absolute. Under certain conditions the law enjoins it as a moral and civil duty for a man to marry his brother's widow. If a brother dies without issue, it is incumbent upon each surviving brother in succession to marry the widow, and if the brother-in-law refused to perform the sacred duty, the widow made him pass through a ceremony in which she heaped upon him the greatest indignity. This clearly shows that the prohibition here could not be based upon the ground of incest, since that which is inherently incestuous the Divine law itself would under no circumstances have set aside. This duty the surviving brother-in-law had to perform to the widows of as many of his brothers as happened to die without issue. A striking illustration of this fact occurred whilst Jehudah the Holy was president of the Sanhedrin. Twelve widows appealed to their brother-in-law to perform the duty of <span class= "ital">Levir. </span>He refused to marry them because he saw no prospect how to maintain such an additional number of wives, and possibly a large increase of children. The case came before the President of the Sanhedrin, who not only decided that he must marry them all, but promised that if he would do the duty enjoined upon him by the Law of Moses, he himself would maintain the family, and their children in case there should be any, every Sabbatical year, when no produce was got from the land, which was at rest. The offer was accepted by the <span class= "ital">Levir, </span>and he accordingly married his twelve sisters-in-law. After three years these twelve wives appeared with thirty-six children before Jehudah the Holy, to claim the promised alimony, as it was the Sabbatical year, and they actually obtained it. To this day this law is in force among the orthodox Jews. When a man dies without issue, the widow <span class= "ital">ipso facto </span>belongs to the surviving brother, and she is not allowed to marry any one else unless her brother-in-law has gone through the ceremony of publicly renouncing her, which is tantamount to a divorce. This will explain the rendering of the clause before us in the ancient Chaldee Version, "thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife in the lifetime of thy brother or after his death if he has children."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The eighth ease of incest is intercourse with a brother's wife. Yet this is commanded under certain circumstances in the Book of Deuteronomy, and was practiced in patriarchal times (<a href="/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>). The following are the circumstances under which it is commanded. "If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her" (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>). It has been asked, "How can the same thing be forbidden as immoral in Leviticus, and commanded as a duly in Deuteronomy?" Bishop Wordsworth replies, "In a special case, for a special reason applicable only to the Jews, God was pleased to dispense with that law, and in the plenitude of his omnipotence to change the prohibition into a command.... God cannot command anything that is sinful. For sin is 'transgression of the Law' (<a href="/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>), and whatever he commands is right. But it would be presumptuous to say that <span class="accented">we</span> may dispense with God's law concerning marriage, because he in one case dispensed with it; as it would be impious to affirm that murder is not immoral, and may be committed by us, bemuse God, who is the sole Arbiter of life and death, commanded Abraham to slay his son Isaac." The levirate marriage was not a concession to the desires of the second brother, but a duty enjoined for a family or tribal purpose, and it was plainly at all times must distasteful. Thus Onan refused to perform his duty to Er's wife (<a href="/genesis/38-9.htm">Genesis 38:9</a>); the legislation in Deuteronomy anticipates objection on the part of the brother, and institutes an in-suiting ceremony to be gone through by him if he declines to do his duty to his dead brother (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9, 10</a>), which we see carried out in some of its details in the case of Ruth's kinsman (<a href="/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7, 10</a>). Indeed, in such a marriage, the second husband seems rather to have been regarded as the continuation of the first husband than as having a substantive existence of his own as a married man. He performed a function in order "that the name of his brother which is dead may not be put out of Israel" (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6</a>), "to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren" (<a href="/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10</a>). The second husband's position may be compared to that of the concubine presented by Rachel to her husband. "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her" (<a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3</a>). The whole object of the rule was that, as the elder brother could not keep up the flintily by begetting an heir, the younger brother should do it for him after his death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have sexual relations with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;er&#183;wa&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6172.htm">Strong's 6172: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nakedness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your brother&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
