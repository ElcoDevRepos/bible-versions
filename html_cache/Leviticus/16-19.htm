The use of the priest's finger indicates a personal and deliberate action, emphasizing the importance of the ritual. The number seven is often associated with completeness and perfection in the Bible, reflecting the thoroughness of the cleansing process. This ritual is part of the Day of Atonement, a critical moment in the Jewish calendar, where the high priest makes atonement for the sins of the people. The sprinkling of blood foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the complete atonement of humanity's sins.<p><b>to cleanse it and consecrate it</b><br>Cleansing and consecration are two distinct but related actions. Cleansing refers to the removal of impurity or sin, while consecration involves setting something apart as holy. In the context of the tabernacle, these actions ensure that the space is suitable for God's presence. This dual process highlights the need for both purification from sin and dedication to God. The cleansing and consecration of the altar symbolize the need for holiness in worship and service to God, pointing to the New Testament teaching that believers are to be living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>from the uncleanness of the Israelites</b><br>The uncleanness mentioned here refers to the spiritual and moral impurities that separate the Israelites from God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, uncleanness could result from various sources, including sin, disease, or contact with certain objects or individuals. The Day of Atonement addresses these impurities, restoring the relationship between God and His people. This concept of uncleanness and the need for atonement is echoed in the New Testament, where sin is seen as a barrier to fellowship with God, and Jesus' sacrifice is the means of cleansing and reconciliation (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, responsible for performing the rituals of atonement.
