In the ancient Israelite context, purity laws were central to maintaining holiness and separation from defilement. The concept of being "unclean until evening" underscores the temporary nature of this impurity, emphasizing the need for purification before re-entering communal worship or daily activities. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and the need for cleansing, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>, which calls for washing and purification.<p><b>and whoever carries such things must wash his clothes and bathe with water</b><br>The requirement to wash clothes and bathe signifies a deeper level of purification, indicating that carrying objects associated with impurity required more than just waiting for time to pass. This practice highlights the importance of external actions reflecting internal states of purity and holiness. The act of washing with water is a precursor to the New Testament concept of baptism, symbolizing spiritual cleansing and renewal, as seen in <a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>, where baptism is linked to washing away sins.<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>Reiterating the temporary nature of the impurity, this phrase emphasizes the cyclical nature of daily purification in the life of an Israelite. The evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing a fresh start and the restoration of ritual purity. This concept is echoed in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning, offering hope and renewal. The temporary uncleanness also points to the ultimate cleansing through Christ, who provides a permanent solution to sin and impurity, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>, where believers are encouraged to draw near to God with a cleansed conscience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, as they journeyed through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>- The mediators between God and the people, responsible for maintaining ritual purity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_person.htm">Unclean Person</a></b><br>- An individual who is ceremonially unclean due to various conditions, including bodily discharges.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br><a href="/leviticus/15-10.htm">Leviticus 15:10</a> emphasizes the importance of ritual purity in maintaining a relationship with God.

In verse 10 the focus shifts to anyone who simply touches objects the afflicted man has been sitting or lying on. The point is clear: impurity is transferable. This echoes earlier verses in the same chapter&#8212;&#8220;Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies will be unclean&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/15-4.htm">Leviticus 15:4</a>). The principle safeguards the holiness of the community by recognizing that sin and impurity are not isolated. Similar caution appears in <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>, where holiness cannot be transferred by touch, but impurity can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be unclean until evening</b><p>God sets a definitive, but limited, period of uncleanness. Evening marks the start of a new day in the Hebrew reckoning (<a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>). Thus, the defilement is real, yet temporary. It reminds Israel that God provides a pathway back to purity without leaving them indefinitely cut off (cf. <a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24&#8211;25</a>; 22:6&#8211;7). Spiritually, this underscores God&#8217;s mercy even when He enforces His standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever carries such things must wash his clothes</b><p>Handling the objects intensifies involvement, so an outward act&#8212;washing garments&#8212;is required. Clothes often symbolize one&#8217;s public life (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; Jude 23). Washing them pictures a visible break with impurity, paralleling the believer&#8217;s call to &#8220;cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bathe with water</b><p>Personal bathing adds a second layer of cleansing. Water frequently points to God&#8217;s Word and the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38&#8211;39</a>). The action is literal in Leviticus, yet it foreshadows the deeper spiritual washing that Christ brings (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he will be unclean until evening</b><p>Even after washing, the person remains ceremonially unclean until sunset. This shows that cleansing is God-appointed, not self-generated. Time itself, ordained by the Lord, completes the process. It teaches patience and dependence, themes echoed when Jesus instructs the leper He healed to follow Mosaic procedures (<a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-10.htm">Leviticus 15:10</a> teaches transferable impurity, the need for intentional cleansing, and God&#8217;s gracious time-bound provision for restoration. Touching contaminated objects brings real defilement, yet washing and waiting mark the way back into fellowship. The verse ultimately points beyond ritual to Christ, whose once-for-all sacrifice and living water offer believers complete and lasting purity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him.</span>--That is, the seat in the palanquin on which the passenger sits.
