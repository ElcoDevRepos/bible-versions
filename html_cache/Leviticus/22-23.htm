This type of offering is distinct from mandatory sacrifices, such as sin or guilt offerings. The freewill offering reflects the worshiper's personal relationship with God, emphasizing the heart's intent over the perfection of the offering itself. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to give cheerfully and willingly (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>an ox or sheep</b><br>Oxen and sheep were common livestock in ancient Israel, often used in sacrifices due to their value and significance in agrarian society. These animals were integral to the economy and daily life, symbolizing wealth and sustenance. The choice of these animals for offerings underscores their importance and the sacrifice involved in giving them to God. In a broader biblical context, sheep are frequently used as symbols of God's people, and Jesus is referred to as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), highlighting the sacrificial system's foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>that has a deformed or stunted limb</b><br>The mention of a deformed or stunted limb indicates a physical imperfection in the animal. While such animals were not suitable for mandatory offerings, they were permitted for freewill offerings. This allowance highlights the distinction between offerings that fulfill specific vows or requirements and those given voluntarily. The emphasis on physical perfection in other offerings points to the holiness and perfection required by God, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who was without blemish (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><b>but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow</b><br>Vows in the biblical context were solemn promises made to God, often accompanied by a specific offering. The requirement for offerings fulfilling vows to be without blemish underscores the seriousness and sanctity of vows. This reflects the principle that what is promised to God must be of the highest quality, symbolizing the worshiper's commitment and reverence. The distinction between freewill offerings and vow fulfillments highlights the varying levels of obligation and the importance of integrity in one's promises to God. This principle is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making rash vows to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites on how to live holy lives.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, including instructions on offerings and sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites worshiped God and offered sacrifices, serving as the central place of worship during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, responsible for performing the sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/freewill_offering.htm">Freewill Offering</a></b><br>A voluntary offering made by the Israelites to express devotion and gratitude to God, distinct from obligatory sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_worship.htm">Holiness in Worship</a></b><br>God desires offerings that reflect our best, symbolizing our respect and reverence for Him.

God is instructing priests how to handle sacrifices so that, as <a href="/leviticus/22-2.htm">Leviticus 22:2</a> says, they &#8220;do not profane My holy name.&#8221; Similar concern for purity appears in <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel is called &#8220;a kingdom of priests,&#8221; and in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, reminding believers that holiness still matters today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Freewill offering allowed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;You may present as a freewill offering an ox or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-23.htm">Leviticus 22:23</a>a)<p>&#8226; A freewill offering was voluntary, expressing gratitude or devotion (compare <a href="/leviticus/7-16.htm">Leviticus 7:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God graciously permits blemished animals for this category. The worshiper&#8217;s heart, not the animal&#8217;s perfection, is foregrounded here&#8212;echoed later in <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a> (&#8220;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit&#8221;) and <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> (&#8220;God loves a cheerful giver&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Allowing a less-than-perfect animal guarded the poor from being excluded (see <a href="/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11&#8211;13</a>, which lets the poor offer flour instead of livestock).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Limitations for vow offerings</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;&#8230; but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-23.htm">Leviticus 22:23</a>b).<p>&#8226; A vow offering sealed a promise (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>). Because vows invoked God&#8217;s name, the offering had to be flawless to match His character (<a href="/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The difference underscores that voluntary worship (freewill) and pledged worship (vow) are both important, yet they carry different levels of obligation.

The verse balances God&#8217;s compassion toward sincere worshipers with His demand for integrity and holiness when His name is invoked. Ultimately, it points to Christ&#8217;s flawless sacrifice, freeing believers to give gladly and to keep their commitments faithfully.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Either a bullock or a lamb.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And bullock and one of the flock.</span><p><span class= "bld">That hath any thing superfluous.</span>--That is one member of the animal being more elongated or contracted than the other, being out of proportion.

Hence, during the second Temple, the passage before us was interpreted to mean that the animals in question were only allowed to be consecrated for the maintenance and repair of the sanctuary, but not to be offered as a sacrifice on the altar. They were sold, or the offerer paid the value himself, and the money was applied to these sacred purposes. The opinion that a freewill offering was of less importance than a vow, and that therefore the lawgiver allows animals with the two kinds of defects here described to be offered for a freewill offering but not for a vow, is contrary to the regulations laid down in <a href="/context/leviticus/22-18.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;">Leviticus 22:18-20</a>, and is against the practice during the second Temple (see <a href="/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a>). It is far more probable that the text is disarranged, and that it originally was, "that thou mayest not offer for a freewill offering, and for a vow it shall not be accepted." . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/22-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You may present</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as a freewill offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5071.htm">Strong's 5071: </a> </span><span class="str2">Spontaneity, spontaneous, a spontaneous, abundant gift</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an ox</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
