The Hebrew term used here can refer to a variety of skin conditions, not just leprosy as understood today. The breaking out of the disease all over the skin indicates a progression that requires careful examination by the priest. This reflects the meticulous nature of the Levitical laws, which were designed to maintain the holiness and purity of the community. The comprehensive spread of the disease might symbolize the pervasive nature of sin, which can affect every aspect of a person's life.<p><b>so that it covers all the skin of the infected person from head to foot</b><br>The complete coverage of the skin by the disease suggests a totality that is significant in biblical symbolism. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such a condition would render a person ritually unclean, affecting their ability to participate in communal and religious life. This total coverage can be seen as a metaphor for the all-encompassing nature of sin and the need for divine intervention. The imagery of being covered from head to foot is reminiscent of the need for full redemption and cleansing, which is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through the atoning work of Jesus Christ.<p><b>as far as the priest can see</b><br>The role of the priest in examining the skin disease underscores the importance of spiritual leadership and discernment in the community. The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, ensuring that the laws of purity are upheld. This phrase highlights the limitations of human perception and the need for divine guidance in matters of judgment. The priest's examination is a type of the ultimate judgment that God will render, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The priest's role also prefigures the work of Christ, our High Priest, who provides the ultimate cleansing from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests served as mediators between God and the people, and they were responsible for diagnosing skin diseases, including leprosy, as part of their duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/infected_person.htm">Infected Person</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who is suspected of having a skin disease, which in the context of Leviticus, often refers to leprosy or similar conditions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/skin_disease.htm">Skin Disease</a></b><br>The term used here is "tzaraath" in Hebrew, which can refer to a variety of skin conditions, not just leprosy as understood today.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_camp.htm">Israelite Camp</a></b><br>The setting for these laws is the Israelite camp during their wilderness journey, where maintaining ritual purity was essential.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>As the leader of the Israelites, Moses received these laws from God and communicated them to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity_and_holiness.htm">Ritual Purity and Holiness</a></b><br>The laws concerning skin diseases underscore the importance of holiness and purity in the community of God's people.
