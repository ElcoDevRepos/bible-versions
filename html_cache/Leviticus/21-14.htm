The prohibition against marrying a widow or divorced woman underscores the importance of maintaining a lineage that is ceremonially clean and free from any associations that might be seen as defiling. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was not only a personal union but also a communal and religious matter. The high priest's marriage was to symbolize the purity and sanctity of the priesthood. The mention of a woman "defiled by prostitution" highlights the need for the high priest to avoid any union that could bring reproach or impurity, as prostitution was often associated with pagan worship practices. This requirement for the high priest can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the pure and spotless bridegroom in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>He is to marry a virgin from his own people,</b><br>The command for the high priest to marry a virgin from his own people ensures that the marriage remains within the covenant community of Israel, preserving the cultural and religious identity of the nation. This requirement also serves to maintain the purity and holiness of the priestly line. The emphasis on marrying a virgin reflects the ideal of purity and the importance of the high priest's family being above reproach. This can be connected to the New Testament portrayal of the Church as the bride of Christ, called to be pure and holy (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>). The high priest's marriage to a virgin symbolizes the unblemished relationship between Christ and His Church, highlighting the call for believers to live lives of holiness and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, the high priest held a unique and sacred role in Israelite society, serving as the chief religious leader and mediator between God and the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom these laws were given, representing God's chosen people who were to live according to His statutes and commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the laws and commandments, including those found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the high priest performed his duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_moses.htm">The Law of Moses</a></b><br>The body of laws given to the Israelites, which includes the book of Leviticus and outlines the requirements for holiness and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The high priest's marriage restrictions highlight the importance of holiness and separation from worldly influences.
