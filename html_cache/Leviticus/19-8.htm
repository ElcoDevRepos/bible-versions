In the context of Leviticus, the sacrificial system was central to Israel's worship and relationship with God. Eating the meat outside the prescribed time was a violation of God's commands, symbolizing disobedience and disrespect for His holiness. The concept of "bearing iniquity" implies personal responsibility for sin, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, emphasizing that each individual is accountable for their actions (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><b>for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD</b><br>Profaning what is holy indicates treating sacred things with irreverence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, holiness was associated with being set apart for divine purposes. The sacrificial offerings were consecrated to God, and mishandling them was a direct affront to His sanctity. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God&#8217;s holiness demands reverence and obedience (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The sacrificial system foreshadows Christ, the ultimate sacrifice, who was wholly consecrated to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>That person must be cut off from his people</b><br>Being "cut off" signifies a severe penalty, often interpreted as excommunication or even death. This punishment underscores the gravity of the offense and the importance of maintaining purity within the community. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where communal holiness was paramount. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where church discipline is practiced to preserve the integrity of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>). The phrase also points to the ultimate separation from God that sin causes, highlighting the need for redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of the Levitical laws, called to be a holy nation set apart for God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and requires holiness from His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sacrificial_system.htm">The Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The context of this verse, which involves offerings made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship where sacrifices were offered, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_worship.htm">Holiness in Worship</a></b><br>God requires that His people approach Him with reverence and respect for His holiness.
