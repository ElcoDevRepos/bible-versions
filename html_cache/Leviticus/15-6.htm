In ancient Israel, purity laws were central to maintaining holiness and community health. The discharge likely refers to a medical condition, possibly a chronic illness, which rendered a person ceremonially unclean. The furniture, as an extension of the person, also becomes unclean. This reflects the broader biblical principle that impurity can spread through contact, emphasizing the need for separation and purification.<p><b>must wash his clothes and bathe with water</b><br>Washing clothes and bathing were common purification rituals in the Old Testament, symbolizing the removal of impurity. Water is often used in Scripture as a symbol of cleansing and renewal (e.g., <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>). This act of washing signifies a return to a state of ritual purity, necessary for participation in communal worship and activities. The emphasis on physical cleanliness also underscores the importance of spiritual purity.<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>The designation of being unclean until evening indicates a temporary state of impurity. Evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing a fresh start and the restoration of purity. This temporal aspect of uncleanness highlights the mercy and grace inherent in the law, allowing for restoration and reintegration into the community. The concept of evening as a time of renewal can be seen in other biblical contexts, such as the creation narrative in Genesis, where each day begins with evening.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_discharge.htm">The Man with the Discharge</a></b><br>This refers to an individual experiencing a bodily discharge, which, according to Levitical law, renders him ceremonially unclean.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_person_who_sits.htm">The Person Who Sits</a></b><br>Anyone who comes into contact with objects that the unclean person has touched becomes unclean themselves.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/ceremonial_cleansing.htm">Ceremonial Cleansing</a></b><br>The process of washing clothes and bathing to remove ceremonial impurity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time by which the person who has become unclean is considered clean again after following the prescribed cleansing rituals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where maintaining ceremonial purity was essential.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ceremonial_law.htm">Understanding Ceremonial Law</a></b><br>Recognize the purpose of these laws in maintaining the holiness of the community and the presence of God among His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity.htm">Symbolism of Purity</a></b><br>Reflect on how physical cleanliness in the Old Testament symbolizes spiritual purity and the need for holiness in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>Consider how the laws encouraged personal responsibility and community awareness regarding purity and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_cleansing.htm">Spiritual Cleansing</a></b><br>Apply the concept of cleansing to our spiritual lives, understanding that through Christ, we are made clean from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_presence.htm">Respect for God's Presence</a></b><br>Acknowledge the seriousness of approaching God with reverence and purity, as emphasized in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_15_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 15:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_6_on_ritual_cleanliness.htm">How does Leviticus 15:6 emphasize the importance of ritual cleanliness in daily life?

The command does not target priests alone; anyone who might unknowingly perch on an unclean seat is addressed. Other passages underline this broad call: when God told the people, &#8220;Be holy, for I am holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>), He spoke to the entire congregation. Paul echoes the same inclusive standard: &#8220;Therefore come out from among them and be separate&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>). Holiness is never delegated; it is embraced by &#8220;whoever.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on which the man with the discharge was sitting</b><p>The issue here is contact with someone suffering a bodily discharge, a condition detailed in <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2-4</a>. The furniture itself becomes ceremonially defiled because impurity transfers through touch&#8212;an acted-out lesson about how easily corruption spreads. <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a> expands the principle: those with discharges were sent outside the camp so the community would remain undefiled. The New Testament draws a moral parallel: &#8220;A little leaven leavens the whole lump&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). Sin contaminates as surely as bodily uncleanness did, urging careful discernment about what we allow into our lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must wash his clothes and bathe with water</b><p>God provides a precise cleansing protocol. First the garments, then the body&#8212;nothing is left to assumption. Earlier, newly healed lepers followed a similar two-step process (<a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>). At Sinai, God told Israel to &#8220;consecrate them today and have them wash their clothes&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>), showing that outward washing symbolized inward consecration. In the gospel era, Christ &#8220;cleanses the church by the washing with water through the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>). The physical act foreshadows the spiritual reality: confession and repentance lead to true purity (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><p>The uncleanness lasted only until the day&#8217;s end, highlighting both the seriousness and the mercy of the law. The same timing appears when touching a carcass (<a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-25</a>). Evening closes one day and anticipates the next&#8212;a built-in promise of renewal. When Jesus healed after sunset (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34</a>), He met people right at that boundary, illustrating the transition from impurity to restored fellowship. Ultimately, Christ&#8217;s sacrifice offers permanent cleansing: &#8220;How much more will the blood of Christ&#8230;cleanse our consciences&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-6.htm">Leviticus 15:6</a> teaches that holiness is communal, contamination is contagious, cleansing is prescribed, and renewal is certain. The verse presses us to guard our associations, obey God&#8217;s means of purification, and celebrate the daily mercies that culminate in Christ, our perfect and lasting cleanser.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/15-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whoever sits</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
