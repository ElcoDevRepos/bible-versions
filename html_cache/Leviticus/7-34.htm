The thigh, often referred to as the "heave offering," was lifted up as a symbolic gesture of presenting it to God. This portion was set aside for the priests, signifying their role as mediators between God and the people.<p><b>and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed as the first high priest, and his descendants were designated as the priestly line.
