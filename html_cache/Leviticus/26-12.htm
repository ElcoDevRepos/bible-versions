It implies a restoration of the broken relationship between God and humanity. The idea of God walking among His people is also seen in the tabernacle and temple, where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). This promise foreshadows the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>). In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit dwells within believers, continuing this theme of God's presence among His people (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>and be your God</b><br>This covenantal language echoes God's promises to the patriarchs, such as His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). It emphasizes God's commitment to His people, establishing a relationship based on His faithfulness and sovereignty. This phrase is central to the identity of Israel as God's chosen nation, set apart for His purposes. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in the New Covenant, where God promises to be the God of all who believe in Christ, both Jew and Gentile (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>).<p><b>and you will be My people</b><br>This statement highlights the reciprocal relationship between God and His people. It underscores the idea of belonging and identity, where the Israelites are called to live in obedience and holiness as a reflection of their relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This concept is expanded in the New Testament, where believers in Christ are described as a "chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The phrase also anticipates the eschatological vision in Revelation, where God's people from every nation will dwell with Him eternally (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises His presence among His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recipients of the covenant and the laws given through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave the Law to Moses, including the blessings and curses found in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Law from God and communicated it to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The promise of God walking among His people signifies His intimate presence and fellowship with them.
