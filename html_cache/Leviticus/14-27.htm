The right hand is often associated with power and blessing in biblical texts (e.g., <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). The act of sprinkling is a ritualistic gesture symbolizing purification and consecration. This specific action is part of the cleansing process for a person healed of a skin disease, emphasizing the importance of precision and intentionality in worship practices.<p><b>some of the oil in his left palm</b><br>Oil in the Bible often represents the Holy Spirit, anointing, and consecration (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The use of oil in this ritual underscores the need for spiritual cleansing and renewal. The left palm holding the oil may symbolize receptivity and readiness to serve, as the left hand is often considered the weaker hand, highlighting dependence on God&#8217;s strength.<p><b>seven times</b><br>The number seven in Scripture frequently symbolizes completeness and perfection, as seen in the creation account (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and throughout biblical prophecy (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). Sprinkling the oil seven times indicates a complete and thorough purification process, ensuring that the individual is fully restored to the community and to God.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the presence and authority of God in the ritual. Performing the act "before the LORD" signifies that the ritual is not merely a human tradition but a divine ordinance. It highlights the importance of God's approval and presence in the process of purification and restoration. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture where offerings and sacrifices are made directly to God (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a crucial role in the purification process, acting as a mediator between the individual and God.

A priest, standing as God&#8217;s ordained mediator, performs the rite exactly as commanded. Scripture is clear that these details are not optional extras but divinely given (<a href="/leviticus/14-11.htm">Leviticus 14:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). Just as blood sacrifices pointed to atonement (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>), this oil&#8208;sprinkling marks the healed person as ceremonially restored to fellowship with God and community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The right forefinger</b><p>Using the right hand underscores strength, authority, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14-20</a>; <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>). The &#8220;right forefinger&#8221; is the precise instrument God designates. The priest&#8217;s obedient use of the correct hand and finger shows that holiness is maintained by following God&#8217;s pattern, not personal improvisation (<a href="/exodus/29-20.htm">Exodus 29:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some of the oil</b><p>Oil in Scripture pictures the Holy Spirit&#8217;s presence and consecration (<a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). In this ritual, the oil signals that the person is not only physically healed but spiritually set apart again. It follows the earlier application of blood to the right ear, thumb, and big toe (<a href="/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14-18</a>), demonstrating that cleansing and anointing go hand in hand&#8212;shadowing the redemptive work of Christ who both forgives and indwells (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From his left palm</b><p>The priest first pours oil into his left palm (<a href="/leviticus/14-15.htm">Leviticus 14:15-16</a>). This simple step highlights stewardship: what God places in our hands is to be used exactly as He directs (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>). The left palm holds the resource; the right forefinger dispenses it. Faithful service respects God&#8217;s order even in small motions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seven times</b><p>Seven is the biblical number of completeness and covenant fulfillment (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). Sprinkling seven times declares that God&#8217;s cleansing work is thorough and final. No part of the person remains outside the Lord&#8217;s restorative reach (<a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6</a>; 16:14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the LORD</b><p>The ceremony takes place &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; meaning in His immediate presence at the sanctuary entrance (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a>). Restoration is not merely social; it is relational with God Himself. The healed individual stands alive and accepted where once he was isolated (<a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-27.htm">Leviticus 14:27</a> shows a priest obediently sprinkling oil with his right forefinger seven times from his left palm before the LORD. Every detail&#8212;hand, finger, oil, number, location&#8212;reveals God&#8217;s meticulous provision for complete cleansing and renewed fellowship. The rite anticipates Christ, who perfectly fulfills both the cleansing by blood and the anointing by the Spirit, bringing sinners fully and finally &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; in restored communion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and sprinkle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hiz&#183;z&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
