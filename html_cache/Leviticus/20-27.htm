This practice was strictly forbidden as it was seen as an abomination to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). The cultural context of the time included widespread pagan practices among neighboring nations, which often involved necromancy and divination. The Israelites were called to be set apart and not to engage in such practices, which were considered to lead people away from reliance on God.<p><b>must surely be put to death.</b><br>The death penalty for mediums and spiritists underscores the severity with which God viewed these practices. This command reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, which emphasizes purity and the need to remove sin from the community. The death penalty served as a deterrent and a means to maintain the spiritual integrity of the nation. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the wages of sin being death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>They shall be stoned;</b><br>Stoning was a common method of execution in ancient Israel, symbolizing communal participation in the judgment. It was a public act, serving as a warning to others. The community's involvement in the execution highlighted the collective responsibility to uphold God's laws. This method of execution is also seen in other instances of capital punishment in the Old Testament, such as in the case of blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>).<p><b>their blood is upon them.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates that the responsibility for the death lies with the offenders themselves. It implies that they have brought the punishment upon themselves through their actions. This concept of personal responsibility is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, which states that the soul who sins shall die. It also reflects the principle of justice in the Mosaic Law, where individuals are accountable for their own sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mediums_and_spiritists.htm">Mediums and Spiritists</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to communicate with the dead or spirits.
