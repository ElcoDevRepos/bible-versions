It highlights the role of Moses as a mediator and leader. The Israelites, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are in a covenant relationship with God, which includes specific laws and commandments. This phrase underscores the communal aspect of the law, as it is meant for the entire nation.<p><b>&#8216;If anyone curses his God</b><br>Cursing God is a serious offense, reflecting a heart of rebellion and disrespect towards the Creator. In the ancient Near Eastern context, blasphemy was considered a grave sin, as it directly challenged the authority and holiness of God. This commandment is part of the broader Mosaic Law, which seeks to maintain the sanctity of God's name and character. The act of cursing God is not just a verbal offense but a reflection of one's inner disposition towards the divine.<p><b>he shall bear the consequences of his sin.</b><br>The phrase indicates personal responsibility and accountability for one's actions. In the context of Leviticus, the consequences often involved severe penalties, including death, as seen in the surrounding verses. This reflects the seriousness with which God views the holiness of His name and the importance of upholding His honor. The concept of bearing one's sin is echoed throughout Scripture, emphasizing that sin has consequences that must be addressed, either through punishment or atonement. This principle is foundational to the sacrificial system and ultimately points to the need for a perfect atonement, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and commandments were given through Moses.

As the criminal who is the immediate occasion of this enactment is an Egyptian, directions are given, in the first place, about the treatment of Gentiles who temporarily sojourn among the Hebrews, and who have not as yet renounced their faith in their own God. If such a Gentile curses his own God in whom he still professes to believe, he shall bear his sin; he must suffer the punishment for his sin from the hands of his co-religionists, whose feelings he has outraged. The Israelites are not to interfere to save him from the consequence of his guilt; for a heathen who reviles the god in whom he believes is not to be trusted in other respects, and sets a bad example to others, who might be led to imitate his conduct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - In accordance with the judicial decision on the man is framed the general law against blasphemy and its penalty. It runs as follows: <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him.</span> It has been questioned whether two offenses or one are here contemplated, whether <span class="accented">cursing his God</span> is one offense, <span class="accented">bearing his sin</span> being its punishment, and <span class="accented">blaspheming the Name of the Lord</span> another and greater offense, for which the punishment is <span class="accented">stoning</span>; or whether the latter offense and punishment are a more specific statement of the offense and punishment which had only generally been described before. Those who take the first view point out that the present offender was an Egyptian, and urge that had he cursed <span class="accented">his God</span>, that is, the Egyptian god or gods, he would only have had to bear his sin; but that as he had blasphemed the Name of Israel's God, Jehovah, he was to be stoned. The second explanation, however, is the truer one. The Scriptures recognize but one God, and he is the Lord Jehovah. Whoever curses him <span class="accented">shall bear his sin</span>, that is, shall be guilty in such a way that his sin must be purged either by punishment or by sacrifice, and it is then further declared that this particular sin can be purged only by the death of the offender at the hand of the congregation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/24-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you are to tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">curses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;qal&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7043.htm">Strong's 7043: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be slight, swift or trifling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
