The distinction between clean and unclean animals is first introduced in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. This separation is not only about dietary laws but also about maintaining ritual purity. The Israelites were to be a holy people, reflecting God's holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The practice of distinguishing between clean and unclean animals served as a daily reminder of their covenant relationship with God. This concept of separation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live distinct lives (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>Do not become contaminated by any animal or bird, or by anything that crawls on the ground;</b><br>Contamination here refers to ritual impurity, which could affect one's ability to participate in worship and community life. The laws concerning clean and unclean animals were a means to prevent such contamination. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purity and holiness, which is essential for approaching God. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the law, and the focus shifts from external purity to internal purity of the heart (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>). However, the principle of avoiding spiritual contamination remains relevant for believers.<p><b>I have set these apart as unclean for you.</b><br>God's designation of certain animals as unclean was specific to the Israelites and served to reinforce their identity as a people set apart for Him. This separation was a physical representation of spiritual truths. The idea of being set apart is central to the concept of holiness. In the New Testament, Peter reiterates this call to holiness, urging believers to be holy in all their conduct (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The setting apart of unclean animals can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was set apart as the ultimate sacrifice to cleanse humanity from sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws of cleanliness and holiness were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave the Law to Moses, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean_animals.htm">Clean and Unclean Animals</a></b><br>Categories of animals defined by God, distinguishing what the Israelites could and could not eat or touch.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_code.htm">Holiness Code</a></b><br>A section of Leviticus (chapters 17-26) that includes laws about holiness, including dietary laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The call to distinguish between clean and unclean is a call to holiness.

It is important that the word should be translated by the same expression, since it not only shows the intimate connection between the two verses, but brings out more forcibly the reason for the exhortation in the verse before us. Because the Lord has separated or distinguished the Israelites from all nations, and is about to give them the promised land, therefore the Israelites are to separate or to distinguish between the clean and unclean animals, as ordained in Leviticus 11. By strictly following out the dietary laws, the Israelites will always be able to keep separate from all other nations (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm" title="But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.">Daniel 1:8</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/20-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are therefore to distinguish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7687;&#183;dal&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
