In <a href="/leviticus/16-31.htm">Leviticus 16:31</a>, the Sabbath of complete rest refers specifically to the Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, a day set apart for the Israelites to cease from all work. This day was unique among the Sabbaths because it was a time for national repentance and atonement for sins. The idea of rest here is not merely physical but also spiritual, symbolizing trust in God's provision and sovereignty. The Sabbath rest foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Jesus Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers enter into God's rest through faith.<p><b>that you may humble yourselves</b><br>Humbling oneself on the Day of Atonement involved fasting and self-denial, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27-32</a>. This act of humility was a physical expression of repentance and acknowledgment of one's sins before God. The Hebrew term for "humble" can also mean "afflict," indicating a deep sense of contrition and penitence. This practice is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to humble themselves before God (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>) and recognize their need for His grace and forgiveness.<p><b>it is a permanent statute</b><br>The phrase "permanent statute" underscores the enduring nature of this commandment for the Israelites. It was to be observed annually, signifying its importance in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people. This statute was not only a reminder of their need for atonement but also pointed to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice on the cross fulfilled the requirements of the law (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>). The permanence of this statute highlights the unchanging nature of God's holiness and the continual need for atonement, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who received the laws from God, including the instructions for the Day of Atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel and brother of Moses, who performed the rituals of atonement as described in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were commanded to observe the Day of Atonement as a day of rest and humility.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A significant and solemn day in the Jewish calendar dedicated to atonement and repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the high priest performed the atonement rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_of_solemn_rest.htm">Sabbath of Solemn Rest</a></b><br>The Day of Atonement is a day set apart for rest, reflecting the Sabbath principle of ceasing from work to focus on spiritual matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_repentance.htm">Humility and Repentance</a></b><br>The command to "humble yourselves" underscores the importance of approaching God with a contrite heart, acknowledging our sins and need for His mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/permanent_statute.htm">Permanent Statute</a></b><br>The Day of Atonement is described as a "permanent statute," indicating its enduring significance and the timeless need for atonement and reconciliation with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_reflection.htm">Spiritual Reflection</a></b><br>This day serves as an opportunity for deep spiritual reflection, encouraging believers to examine their lives and align themselves with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_atonement.htm">Christ as Our Atonement</a></b><br>For Christians, the Day of Atonement points to Jesus Christ, who provides the ultimate atonement for sin, inviting believers to rest in His finished work.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_16_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 16:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_16_31_Rest_humility_focus.htm">How does Leviticus 16:31 emphasize the importance of rest and humility before God?
