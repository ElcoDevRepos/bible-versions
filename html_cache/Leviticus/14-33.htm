In the context of Leviticus, God often speaks directly to Moses, who serves as the mediator between God and the Israelites. Aaron, as the high priest, is included here, highlighting the priestly role in the purification process. This divine instruction underscores the holiness and purity required in the community, reflecting God's desire for His people to be set apart. The inclusion of both Moses and Aaron signifies the unity of leadership in guiding the Israelites according to God's commands.

(See <a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 13:1</a>.)<p> OF A HOUSE, AND ITS CLEANSING (verses 33-53). The subject of leprosy in houses must be regarded from the same point of view as that of leprosy in clothes. The regulations respecting it are not sanitary laws, as Lange represents them, but rest, as Keil argues, upon an ideal or symbolical basis. The same thought is attached to all species of uncleanness. Something - it matters not what - produces a foul and repulsive appearance in the walls of a house. That is in itself sufficient to make that house unclean; for whatever is foul and repulsive is representative of moral and spiritual defilement, and therefore is itself symbolically defiling and defiled. It has been suggested that the special cause of the affection of the houses in Canaan was saltpetre exuding from the materials employed in their building, or iron pyrites in the stone used. This may have been so, or more probably it was the growth of some fungus. Whatever it was, the appearance created by it was so similar to that of leprosy in the human body, as to derive its name from the latter by analogy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Aaron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/leviticus/14-33.htm">OT Law: Leviticus 14:33 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron (Le Lv Lev.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/leviticus/14-32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Leviticus 14:32"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 14:32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/leviticus/14-34.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Leviticus 14:34"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 14:34" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
