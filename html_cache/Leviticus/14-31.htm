This offering underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. The sin offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity, fulfilling the law's requirements and providing a way for complete atonement.<p><b>and the other as a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering represents total dedication and surrender to God, as the entire animal is consumed by fire. This offering signifies the worshiper's desire to be wholly devoted to the LORD. In the New Testament, this is mirrored in the call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The burnt offering also prefigures Christ's complete obedience and sacrifice, as He offered Himself entirely for the redemption of mankind.<p><b>together with the grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, often accompanying burnt and sin offerings, symbolizes thanksgiving and acknowledgment of God's provision. It consists of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, representing the fruit of human labor and God's blessings. This offering highlights the importance of gratitude and reliance on God for sustenance. In the New Testament, Jesus is the Bread of Life, fulfilling the spiritual nourishment symbolized by the grain offering.<p><b>In this way the priest will make atonement</b><br>The role of the priest is central in the atonement process, acting as a mediator between God and the people. The priest's actions foreshadow the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who makes atonement for humanity through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The concept of atonement involves reconciliation and the removal of sin's barrier, restoring fellowship with God.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" emphasizes the presence and holiness of God in the sacrificial process. It signifies that the offerings are made directly to God, who is the ultimate judge and recipient of worship. This underscores the need for purity and reverence in approaching God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>for the one to be cleansed</b><br>The cleansing process in <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a> pertains to those healed from skin diseases, symbolizing the removal of impurity and restoration to the community. This physical cleansing points to the spiritual cleansing available through Christ, who purifies believers from sin and restores them to fellowship with God. The theme of cleansing is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are washed and sanctified through the blood of Jesus (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons /

a sin offering&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The sin offering focuses on the removal of guilt (<a href="/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27-31</a>). Even though leprosy was a physical condition, its ritual uncleanness symbolized the deeper problem of sin that separates people from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By prescribing a sin offering, God shows that cleansing is not only about outward health but about restoring fellowship with Him (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The worshiper brings the bird, but the priest applies the blood, pointing ahead to Christ, our High Priest, who mediates forgiveness (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the other as a burnt offering</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the other as a burnt offering&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The burnt offering is wholly consumed on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>), symbolizing total surrender to God.<p>&#8226; After sin is dealt with, wholehearted devotion naturally follows (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing of sin and burnt offerings teaches that cleansing is never an end in itself; it leads to renewed commitment and worship (<a href="/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with the grain offering</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;together with the grain offering.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The grain offering (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>) represents gratitude for God&#8217;s provision&#8212;no blood, just fine flour, oil, and frankincense.<p>&#8226; By adding it here, God weaves thankfulness into the very process of restoration (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Since grain was daily sustenance, this offering also hints that every aspect of life&#8212;ordinary and sacred&#8212;belongs to Him (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD</b><p>&#8220;In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Atonement means a covering or reconciliation (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest stands as the ordained mediator; his actions foreshadow Christ, who &#8220;entered the Most Holy Place once for all&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the phrase &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-2</a>). True cleansing always happens in God&#8217;s presence&#8212;not by human effort but by His provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the one to be cleansed</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for the one to be cleansed.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The goal is personal restoration. The former leper is now welcomed back into worship and community life (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>; 14:8-9).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this pattern when He tells cleansed lepers to show themselves to the priest (<a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, everyone in Christ experiences a similar journey: confession, cleansing, and reinstatement into fellowship (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-31.htm">Leviticus 14:31</a> teaches that complete restoration involves three movements: guilt removed (sin offering), life dedicated (burnt offering), and gratitude expressed (grain offering). By these God-given steps the priest &#8220;makes atonement before the LORD&#8221; so the healed person can fully re-enter worship and community. In Christ, the ultimate Priest and sacrifice, these same truths find their perfect fulfillment, offering each believer full cleansing, renewed devotion, and daily thanksgiving.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
