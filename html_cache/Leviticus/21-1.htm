Moses, as the mediator between God and Israel, receives commands that are foundational for the priestly code. This reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God speaks to Moses as the leader and lawgiver.<p><b>Speak to Aaron&#8217;s sons, the priests</b><br>Aaron's sons are designated as priests, highlighting their unique role in Israelite worship and service. The priesthood is a hereditary office, beginning with Aaron, the first high priest. This lineage underscores the importance of maintaining purity and holiness, as priests serve as intermediaries between God and the people. The priestly duties include offering sacrifices, maintaining the sanctuary, and teaching the law.<p><b>and tell them that a priest is not to defile himself</b><br>The concept of defilement is central to Levitical law, particularly concerning ritual purity. Priests are held to higher standards of holiness due to their proximity to sacred duties. Defilement, often associated with contact with death or impurity, would disqualify a priest from performing his duties. This requirement underscores the separation between life and death, purity and impurity, in the religious life of Israel.<p><b>for a dead person among his people</b><br>Contact with the dead is a primary source of ritual impurity in the Old Testament. This prohibition reflects the broader biblical theme of life and death, where death is seen as a consequence of sin and a state of impurity. Priests, as representatives of life and holiness, must avoid defilement to maintain their ability to serve in the sanctuary. This regulation also points to the future hope of resurrection and eternal life, themes fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who conquers death and impurity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides laws and instructions to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of Israel, through whom God communicates His laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The sons of Aaron, designated as the spiritual leaders and mediators between God and the people of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel and brother of Moses, whose descendants serve as priests.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/ceremonial_uncleanness.htm">Ceremonial Uncleanness</a></b><br>A state that disqualifies a person from participating in certain religious activities, often related to contact with the dead.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The call for priests to remain ceremonially clean underscores the importance of holiness and separation from sin for those who serve God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_priests.htm">Role of Priests</a></b><br>Priests were mediators between God and the people, highlighting the need for purity in those who lead and serve in spiritual capacities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_life_and_death.htm">Respect for Life and Death</a></b><br>The laws regarding contact with the dead reflect a respect for life and the sanctity of God's presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_leadership.htm">Spiritual Leadership</a></b><br>Those in spiritual leadership today are called to a higher standard of conduct and purity, reflecting God's holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_high_priest.htm">Christ as Our High Priest</a></b><br>Jesus fulfills the role of the ultimate High Priest, providing a way for all believers to approach God with purity and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_21_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 21:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_21_1_Priestly_holiness_focus.htm">How does Leviticus 21:1 emphasize the holiness required of priests?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_avoid_dead_defilement_priests.htm">Why must priests avoid defilement by the dead according to Leviticus 21:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_21_1_and_New_Testament_holiness.htm">How does Leviticus 21:1 relate to the New Testament's call for holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_stay_holy_daily.htm">What practical steps can believers take to maintain holiness in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_leaders_apply_Leviticus_21_1.htm">How can church leaders today apply the principles from Leviticus 21:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_can_t_priests_mourn_the_dead.htm">Why does Leviticus 21:1 restrict priests from mourning for the dead?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_21_1_Priestly_holiness.htm">How does Leviticus 21:1 reflect the holiness required of priests?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Leviticus_21_1_laws.htm">What historical context influenced the laws in Leviticus 21:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_leviticus_21_1-4_historically_accurate.htm">How historically accurate is the claim in Leviticus 21:1&#8211;4 that any contact with the dead (apart from immediate family) defiled a priest?

The peculiar phrase "the priests the sons of Aaron," which only occurs here--since in all other six passages in the Pentateuch it is the reverse, "the sons of Aaron the priests" (see <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-8.htm" title="And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:">Leviticus 1:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm" title="And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm" title="And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.">Leviticus 3:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-8.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.">Numbers 10:8</a>; Note on <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>), is designed to inculcate upon them the fact that they are priests by virtue of being the sons of Aaron, and not because of any merit of their own, and that they are to impress the same sentiments upon their issue. This fact, moreover, as the authorities during the second Temple remark, imposes upon the priests the duty of bringing up their children in such a manner as to make them morally and intellectually fit to occupy this hereditary office. They also deduce from the emphatic position of the term "priests," that it only applies to those of them who are fit to perform their sacerdotal duties, and not to the disqualified priests (see <a href="/leviticus/21-15.htm" title="Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.">Leviticus 21:15</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - The first paragraph refers to ceremonial uncleanness derived to the priest from his family relations. The priest may not take part in any funeral rites, the effect of which was legal defilement, except in the case of the death of his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, and unmarried sister. These are all that appear to be mentioned. But what, then, are we to understand regarding his wife? Was the priest allowed to lake part in mourning ceremonies for her or not? It is thought by some that her case is met by verse 4, <span class="cmt_word">But he shall not defile himself,</span> being <span class="cmt_word">a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</span> The literal translation of this verse is. <span class="accented">He shall not be defiled, a lord</span> (<span class="accented">haul</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> The word <span class="accented">baal</span>, or <span class="accented">lord</span>, is commonly used in the sense of <span class="accented">husband.</span> The clause, therefore, may be understood to forbid the priest to mourn for his wife, being rendered, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as an husband</span> (i.e., <span class="accented">for his wife</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> This, however, is something of a forced rendering. The words arc better understood to mean, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as a master of a house among his people</span>; that is, he may not lake part in the funeral rites of slaves or other members of the household, which ordinarily brought defilement on the master of a house. Then is the priest forbidden to mourn for his wife? This we can hardly believe, when he might mourn for father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. Nor is it necessary to take this view. For the case of the wife is covered by the words. <span class="cmt_word">For his kin, that is near unto him.... he may be defiled.</span> The wife, being so closely attached to the husband, is not specifically named, because that was not necessary, but is included under the expression, <span class="accented">his kin, that is near unto him</span>, just as daughter, grandmother, niece, and wife's sister, are covered by the phrase, "near of kin," without being specifically named in chapter Leviticus 18 (see note on chapter Leviticus 16:18). Even when mourning is permitted, the priest is to use no excessive forms of it, still less any that have been used by idolaters. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard</span> (see <a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">nor make any cuttings in their flesh</span> (see <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>).
