In the context of Leviticus, salt symbolizes the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people. The grain offering, or "minchah," was a voluntary act of worship, expressing gratitude and dedication to God. By adding salt, the Israelites were reminded of the perpetual covenant with God, emphasizing the need for purity and preservation in their relationship with Him. This practice also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who referred to His followers as "the salt of the earth" (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>), highlighting their role in preserving and purifying the world.<p><b>You must not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering;</b><br>The "salt of the covenant" signifies the binding and enduring nature of God's promises. In ancient times, salt was often used in treaties and agreements to symbolize loyalty and permanence. This phrase underscores the importance of faithfulness to God's covenant, reminding the Israelites of their unique relationship with Him. The covenantal aspect of salt is echoed in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>, where it is mentioned in the context of God's covenant with David. This enduring covenant is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who established a new covenant through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>you are to add salt to each of your offerings.</b><br>The repetition of the command to add salt to offerings highlights its significance in worship. Salt's preservative qualities symbolize the lasting nature of the worshiper's commitment to God. This practice served as a constant reminder of the need for sincerity and integrity in worship. The inclusion of salt in every offering points to the comprehensive nature of God's covenant, encompassing all aspects of life and worship. This principle is reflected in the New Testament, where believers are called to offer their lives as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), maintaining the purity and integrity symbolized by salt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws and instructions from God to give to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The recipients of the laws, who were to follow these instructions as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>- A type of offering made to God, consisting of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt.htm">Salt</a></b><br>- A crucial element in the offerings, symbolizing preservation, purity, and the enduring nature of the covenant with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>- The sacred agreement between God and the Israelites, of which the salt is a symbol, representing its perpetual and unbreakable nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_salt.htm">Symbolism of Salt</a></b><br>Salt in the grain offering symbolizes the enduring and preserving nature of God's covenant with His people.

Israel&#8217;s sacrifice wasn&#8217;t a bribe or a mere ritual; it was participation in an enduring relationship.<p>&#8226; For believers today, every act of service rests on the New Covenant sealed by Christ&#8217;s blood (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).

Today, Christ-followers honor the same God by ensuring all we present&#8212;lives, words, deeds&#8212;carries the preserving, flavorful mark of covenant loyalty, never left out, always added, so that our worship remains both savory and steadfast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And every oblation.</span>--But salt, which is the contrary to leaven, and which preserves from putrefaction and corruption, was to be an ingredient, not only of bloodless, but of all animal sacrifices (<a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm" title="And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezekiel 43:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The salt of the covenant of thy God.</span>--From its antiseptic and savoury qualities, salt became the symbol of hospitality, friendship, durability, fidelity. "To eat bread and salt together" is, in the East, an expression for a league of mutual amity (Russell, <span class= "ital">Aleppo, </span>i. 232). When the Arabs make a covenant together, they put salt on the blade of a sword, from whence every one puts a little into his mouth. This constitutes them blood relations, and they remain faithful to each other even when in danger of life (Ritter, Erd. 14:960). Hence the expression "a covenant of salt," which also occurs in <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm" title="All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.">Numbers 18:19</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm" title="Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?">2Chronicles 13:5</a>, denotes an indissoluble alliance, an everlasting covenant. Hence, too, the phrase "salted with the salt of the palace" (<a href="/ezra/4-14.htm" title="Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;">Ezra 4:14</a>) means bound by sacred obligations of fidelity to the king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt. Salt is commanded as symbolizing in things spiritual, because preserving in things physical, incorruption (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>; <a href="/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>). It is an emblem of an established and enduring covenant, such as God's covenant with his people, which is never to wax old and be destroyed, and it is therefore termed the salt of the covenant of thy God. Hence "a covenant of salt" came to mean a covenant that should not be broken (<a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>). The use of salt is not confined to the meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
