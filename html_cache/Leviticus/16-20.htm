The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, was the innermost part of the Tabernacle, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. Only the high priest could enter this sacred space, and only once a year, to make atonement for the sins of Israel. This purification process involved the sprinkling of blood from a sacrificial bull and goat, symbolizing the cleansing of sin and the appeasement of God's wrath. This act foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who entered the heavenly sanctuary once for all by His own blood (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><b>the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It served as the central place of worship and sacrifice. The purification of the Tent of Meeting signifies the removal of the defilement caused by the sins of the people, ensuring that God's presence could continue to dwell among them. This reflects the necessity of holiness and purity in approaching God, a theme reiterated throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><b>and the altar</b><br>The altar mentioned here is the altar of burnt offering, located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle. It was used for sacrifices and offerings, which were central to the worship and atonement practices of Israel. Purifying the altar was essential to maintain its sanctity, as it was the place where the blood of sacrifices was offered to God. This act underscores the importance of a pure and undefiled means of approaching God, pointing to Christ as the ultimate sacrifice who sanctifies believers (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10-12</a>).<p><b>he is to bring forward the live goat</b><br>This refers to the second goat in the Day of Atonement ritual, known as the scapegoat or Azazel. After the purification of the sanctuary, Aaron would lay his hands on the head of the live goat, confessing over it all the iniquities of the Israelites, symbolically transferring their sins onto the goat. The goat was then sent into the wilderness, signifying the removal of sin from the community. This act illustrates the concept of substitutionary atonement and the complete removal of sin, prefiguring Christ's role as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, who performs the purification rituals on the Day of Atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/most_holy_place.htm">Most Holy Place</a></b><br>The innermost part of the Tabernacle, where the Ark of the Covenant is kept, symbolizing God's presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the priests perform their duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The structure used for sacrifices, central to the atonement rituals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/live_goat.htm">Live Goat</a></b><br>Part of the ritual of the Day of Atonement, representing the removal of the people's sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_high_priest.htm">The Role of the High Priest</a></b><br>Aaron's role as high priest is a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who intercedes on our behalf.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_atonement.htm">The Significance of Atonement</a></b><br>The Day of Atonement highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for purification.

Because the place is now purified, Israel can be assured that God&#8217;s presence remains among them. Picture language:<p>&#8226; The blood touches the ark&#8217;s cover&#8212; foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s once-for-all offering (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Access is still restricted, teaching reverence and the need for mediation (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Tent of Meeting</b><p>Moving outward, Aaron sprinkles blood in the holy place, the area where priests serve daily (<a href="/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a>). Cleansing here reminds the nation that even their most sacred service needs atonement. <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a> remarks that &#8220;in the same way, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of ministry.&#8221; God provides a covering for everything His people touch.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the altar</b><p>Finally, Aaron purifies the bronze altar in the courtyard (<a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36&#8211;37</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>). Though constant sacrifices burn there, sin still contaminates.

Nothing is left half-done; all steps converge toward complete reconciliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the live goat</b><p>This goat, kept alive until now, embodies substitution and removal. Aaron will &#8220;confess over it all the iniquities of the Israelites&#8221; before sending it into the wilderness (<a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10, 21</a>-22). The scene anticipates:<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>As the goat disappears from sight, Israel sees a living picture of sins removed &#8220;as far as the east is from the west&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/16-20.htm">Leviticus 16:20</a> records the moment when every sacred space&#8212;inner sanctuary, holy place, and altar&#8212;has been cleansed. Only then does Aaron advance to the live goat, dramatizing the full removal of Israel&#8217;s sin. Step by step, God teaches that atonement is deliberate, complete, and originates with Him. The entire sequence points directly to Jesus Christ, whose finished work cleanses the true sanctuary of our hearts and carries every sin away forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And when he hath made an end.</span>--Having finished the expiation for himself, his fellow priests, and the sanctuary with its utensils, the goat destined by lot for Azazel, which was standing in the court before the Lord, was now brought to the high priest, that he might complete the sin-offering for the Israelites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - The second part of the ceremonies of the day now commences. It was not enough that the defilement of the sanctuary should be covered, and the sins of the priests and people atoned for by the blood of the sacrifices. There remained a consciousness of sin. How was this to be taken away? To effect this, Aaron proceeds to the unique ceremony of the day by which the utter removal of sin from the reconciled people is typified. <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring the live goat;</span> this should be translated <span class="accented">offer the live goat.</span> It is the word used above for the <span class="accented">offering</span> of the goat that was slain, and it is the word always used for offering sacrifices to the Lord. The first goat had been offered in the usual manner, the offerer laying his hand on his head and perhaps praying over him. Now the second goat is offered, the high priest having to <span class="cmt_word">lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,... putting them upon the head of the goat.</span> The confession of sins, at first extempore, would naturally, as time progressed, become stereotyped into a liturgical form, as it is found in the Mishna: "O Lord, they have committed iniquity; they have transgressed; they have sinned, - thy people, the house of Israel. O Lord, cover over, I entreat thee, their iniquities, their transgressions, and their sins, which they have wickedly committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee, - thy people, the house of Israel. As it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, saying, ' For on that day shall it be covered over for you, to make you clean; from all your sins before the Lord ye shall be cleansed'" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service '). During this confession of sins the people remained prostrate in humiliation and prayer in the court of the tabernacle, and it was the custom of the high priest to turn towards them as he pronounced the last words, "Ye shall be cleansed." At the conclusion of the confession, the high priest handed over the goat to a fit man, that is, to a man who was standing ready to take charge of him, and <span class="cmt_word">sent him away by his hand into the wilderness.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When [Aaron] has finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;il&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
