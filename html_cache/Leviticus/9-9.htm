This phrase highlights the role of the priestly family in the sacrificial system. The act of bringing the blood signifies the transfer of life, as blood represents life in biblical symbolism (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This action foreshadows the New Testament concept of Jesus as the High Priest who offers His own blood for the atonement of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><b>and he dipped his finger in the blood</b><br>The dipping of the finger in the blood is a ritual act that signifies purification and consecration. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, blood was often used in religious rites to symbolize cleansing and sanctification. This act points to the meticulous nature of the sacrificial system, emphasizing the need for purity and holiness before God. It prefigures the cleansing power of Christ's blood, which purifies believers from sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<p><b>and applied it to the horns of the altar</b><br>The horns of the altar were projections on each corner of the altar, symbolizing strength and power. Applying blood to the horns signifies the consecration of the altar and the offering to God. This act represents the idea that the sacrifice is acceptable and powerful in atoning for sin. The altar itself is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate altar and sacrifice, providing a place of refuge and atonement for believers (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).<p><b>And he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar</b><br>Pouring out the blood at the base of the altar completes the sacrificial ritual, symbolizing the total surrender and offering of life to God. This act underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of a complete sacrifice for atonement. It points forward to the complete and final sacrifice of Jesus, whose blood was poured out for the remission of sins (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>). The base of the altar, being the foundation, signifies the foundational nature of Christ's sacrifice in the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a central figure in the establishment of the Levitical priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_aaron.htm">Sons of Aaron</a></b><br>Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, who served as priests under Aaron's leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The altar of burnt offering, located in the Tabernacle, where sacrifices were made to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/blood.htm">Blood</a></b><br>Symbolic of life and atonement, used in sacrificial rituals to cleanse and consecrate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the altar was located.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priesthood.htm">The Role of the Priesthood</a></b><br>The priesthood, represented by Aaron and his sons, served as mediators between God and the people.
