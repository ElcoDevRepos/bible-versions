The bull as a sin offering signifies the need for purification and atonement for sin. In the ancient Near Eastern context, bulls were often used in sacrificial systems due to their value and significance. The sin offering underscores the gravity of sin and the necessity of a blood sacrifice for atonement, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, which states that without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness. This act prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as He is both the High Priest and the sacrificial offering (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>and make atonement for himself</b><br>Before Aaron could intercede for the people, he had to be cleansed of his own sins. This requirement emphasizes the holiness required to approach God and the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood, which contrasts with the sinless nature of Christ, our eternal High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>). The need for Aaron to atone for himself highlights the temporary and repetitive nature of the Old Covenant sacrifices, pointing to the necessity of a perfect and final atonement through Jesus.<p><b>and his household</b><br>The inclusion of Aaron's household in the atonement process reflects the communal aspect of sin and the need for collective purification. It also underscores the responsibility of the priestly family to maintain holiness, as they were set apart for service to God. This mirrors the New Testament teaching that believers, as a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), are called to live lives of holiness and intercession for others. The concept of household atonement can also be seen as a type of the broader atonement Christ provides for His spiritual household, the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Ultimately, the verse looks forward to Jesus Christ, the sinless High Priest who makes perfect, once-for-all atonement for Himself?

The ritual at this pontifical sacrifice during the second Temple was most solemn and impressive.<p>By the side of the victim, which was placed between the porch and the altar towards the east, stood the high priest, arrayed in his white robes, with his face towards the west. In this attitude of a penitent sinner, the pontiff laid both his hands upon the sacrifice and confessed his sins in an audible voice in the sight of God and the assembled congregation as follows: "O Lord, I have sinned, I have committed iniquity, I have transgressed before thee, I and my house. O Lord, I beseech thee cover over my sins, iniquities, and transgressions which I have committed before thee, I and my house, even as it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant--For on that day He will cover over for you and cleanse you from all your sins," &c. To this the congregation replied: "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever." Whereupon the high priest repeated this confession a second time, including in it the children of Aaron, God's holy people. (See <a href="/leviticus/16-11.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:">Leviticus 16:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Aaron shall offer his bullock... and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</span> The first step is an expiatory offering to reconcile the officiating priest and the remainder of the priestly house to God. This was necessary before his offerings for the people could be accepted. It indicates the defects inherent in a priest whose nature was only that of man, which is compassed about with infirmities. The <span class="accented">offering</span> here commanded is not the slaying, but the solemn presentation, of the bullock to the Lord. In after times the following form of confession was used by the high priest when he laid his hand upon the bullock: - "O Lord, I have committed iniquity; I have transgressed; I have sinned, I and my house. O Lord, I entreat thee, cover over the iniquities, the transgressions, and the sins which I have committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee, I and my house; even as it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, 'For on that day will he cover over for you, to make you clean;
