The desolation is a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience to God's commandments, particularly the failure to observe the Sabbath years. The land's desolation serves as a physical manifestation of divine judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of covenantal breaches. Historically, this desolation occurred during the Babylonian exile, when the Israelites were removed from their land, allowing it to lie fallow.<p><b>the land will have the rest</b><br>The concept of the land resting is rooted in the Sabbath year commandment found in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25:1-7</a>, where every seventh year the land was to lie fallow. This rest was intended to remind the Israelites of their dependence on God and to provide a time of renewal for the land. Theologically, it underscores the principle of divine ownership of the land and the need for human stewardship to align with God's purposes. The rest of the land during the exile symbolizes a forced observance of the Sabbath years that were neglected.<p><b>it did not receive during the Sabbaths</b><br>This phrase highlights the Israelites' failure to observe the Sabbath years, which was a significant aspect of the Mosaic Law. The Sabbath years were meant to be a time of trust in God's provision, as the people were to refrain from agricultural work and rely on what the land naturally produced. The neglect of these Sabbaths is seen as a breach of faith and trust in God, leading to the land's enforced rest during the exile. This neglect is also a reflection of the broader spiritual disobedience of the nation.<p><b>when you lived in it</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the time when the Israelites inhabited the Promised Land. It serves as a reminder of the blessings and responsibilities that came with living in the land God had given them. The phrase underscores the conditional nature of the covenant: the land was a gift, but its continued enjoyment was contingent upon obedience to God's laws. The historical context of this phrase is the period of the Judges and the monarchy, where cycles of disobedience and repentance were common. Theologically, it points to the idea that God's blessings are tied to covenant faithfulness, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ, who perfectly fulfills the law on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Law through Moses, including the command to observe the Sabbath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The Promised Land given to the Israelites, which was to observe a Sabbath rest every seventh year.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_rest.htm">Sabbath Rest</a></b><br>A commandment from God for the land to rest every seventh year, symbolizing trust in God's provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The consequence of Israel's disobedience, leading to the land lying desolate and finally receiving its rest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the Law, including the instructions for the Sabbath rest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God's commands, including the Sabbath rest, are not arbitrary but are designed for our good and His glory.

Once removed, the land benefited by their absence&#8212;a sobering reversal (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase personalizes responsibility: covenant privilege always carries covenant accountability (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows future hope; one day the restored people would inhabit the land again, this time mindful of God&#8217;s statutes (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/26-35.htm">Leviticus 26:35</a> states, &#8220;All the days that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during your Sabbaths when you lived in it.&#8221; God literally enforced His sabbath law by sending Israel into exile, allowing the land to enjoy the rest His people had denied it. The verse affirms that God remembers every command, tracks every act of obedience or neglect, and keeps His promises down to the very year. Creation itself testifies to His sovereignty: when His people refuse the rhythms He sets, He will still accomplish them&#8212;sometimes through judgment, always for His glory and ultimate restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">All the days of its desolation shall it keep that rest which it did not rest, </span>&c, that is, the land during its desolation will not be cultivated but will lie fallow, and thus be enabled to make up by its long rest for the many sabbaths and sabbatical years of which it had been deprived by the lawless Israelites during their sojourn in it.
