It symbolized the dedication of the fruits of human labor to God, acknowledging His provision. This offering was typically made from the firstfruits of the harvest, emphasizing gratitude and reliance on God for sustenance.<p><b>of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour</b><br>An ephah was a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. Two-tenths of an ephah would be approximately 4.4 liters or 1.16 gallons. The use of fine flour indicates the quality and purity required for offerings to God, symbolizing the best of what one has to offer.<p><b>mixed with oil</b><br>Oil was a common element in offerings, representing richness and the presence of the Holy Spirit. Mixing oil with the flour could symbolize the anointing and sanctification of the offering, setting it apart for holy use. Oil was also a staple in the diet and economy of the region, further emphasizing the offering's value.<p><b>a food offering to the LORD</b><br>Food offerings were a central part of worship in the Old Testament, serving as a means of fellowship between God and His people. These offerings were not consumed by the offerer but were wholly given to God, signifying total devotion and surrender.<p><b>a pleasing aroma</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe sacrifices that are acceptable to God. It signifies God's satisfaction with the offering, which is not based on the physical smell but on the heart and obedience of the worshiper. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a "fragrant offering" to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>and its drink offering of a quarter hin of wine</b><br>A hin was a unit of liquid measure, approximately 3.8 liters or 1 gallon. A quarter hin would be about 0.95 liters or 1 quart. The drink offering, often wine, was poured out as an act of worship and dedication. Wine, a symbol of joy and celebration, also points to the future Messianic banquet and the blood of Christ, which would be poured out for the forgiveness of sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons /
