The garments worn during the offering process were considered holy and were not to be worn outside the sacred space. This act symbolizes the separation between the holy and the common, emphasizing the need for purity and reverence in approaching God. The changing of garments can also be seen as a type of Christ, who took on human flesh (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>) and later was glorified.<p><b>put on other clothes</b><br>The instruction to put on different clothes signifies a transition from sacred duties to a more common task. This change underscores the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the priestly garments, which were to be worn only within the tabernacle or temple precincts. It reflects the broader biblical theme of being clothed in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>) and the transformation that occurs when one is in service to God.<p><b>and carry the ashes outside the camp</b><br>The removal of ashes to a place outside the camp highlights the need to keep the camp pure and free from the remnants of sin offerings. This practice points to the separation of sin from the community, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament with the removal of sin through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>). The act of taking the ashes outside the camp also prefigures Christ's crucifixion outside the city walls of Jerusalem.<p><b>to a ceremonially clean place</b><br>The requirement for a clean place for the disposal of ashes underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity. This reflects the broader Levitical concern with cleanliness and holiness, which is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel.
