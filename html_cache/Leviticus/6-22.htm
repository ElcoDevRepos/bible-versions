Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed as the first high priest, and his descendants were to continue in this role. This lineage underscores the importance of family and tradition in maintaining religious duties. The priesthood was a sacred office, and only those from Aaron's line were eligible, emphasizing the concept of divine selection and order.<p><b>and will be anointed to take his place</b><br>Anointing with oil was a significant ritual in ancient Israel, symbolizing consecration and the setting apart of individuals for God's service. This act of anointing signified the transfer of authority and responsibility from one generation to the next. It also prefigures the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who was anointed by the Holy Spirit. The continuity of the priesthood through anointing highlights the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>is to prepare it</b><br>The preparation of offerings was a central duty of the priests, requiring precision and adherence to God's instructions. This preparation involved both physical and spiritual readiness, ensuring that the offerings were acceptable to God. The meticulous nature of these preparations reflects the holiness and reverence required in approaching God, a theme that runs throughout Leviticus.<p><b>As a permanent portion for the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates that the offering is dedicated entirely to God, signifying His ownership and sovereignty. The concept of a "permanent portion" underscores the perpetual nature of God's covenant with His people. It also points to the idea of giving God the first and best of what one has, a principle that is echoed in the New Testament with the call to offer one's life as a living sacrifice (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>it must be burned completely</b><br>The complete burning of the offering symbolizes total devotion and surrender to God. This act of burning represents purification and the removal of sin, as the smoke ascends to heaven, signifying the offering's acceptance by God. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly and completely for the atonement of humanity's sins. The complete consumption of the offering by fire illustrates the consuming holiness of God and the need for purity in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The verse refers to the priestly duties and the succession of the priesthood, emphasizing the role of the priest in maintaining the offerings and rituals as prescribed by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>This is the sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites.
