The prohibition against sexual relations with a father's wife is a specific application of the broader commandment against adultery. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such relationships were often seen as a violation of family honor and social order. This law underscores the importance of maintaining family integrity and respecting the marital bond. The phrase "father's wife" may refer to a stepmother, indicating that the prohibition extends beyond biological mothers. This command is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul addresses a similar situation in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, condemning a man for having relations with his father's wife, thus reinforcing the continuity of this moral principle.<p><b>it would dishonor your father.</b><br>The concept of honor and shame was central to ancient Israelite society. Engaging in sexual relations with a father's wife would bring shame not only upon the individual but also upon the family and the community. This act would be seen as a direct affront to the father's authority and dignity. The Hebrew word for "dishonor" can also imply uncovering or exposing, suggesting a violation of the father's privacy and rights. This commandment reflects the broader biblical theme of honoring one's parents, as seen in the Fifth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The emphasis on family honor is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as a Father who desires His children to live in a way that reflects His holiness and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites on holy living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws were given to set them apart from other nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father's_wife.htm">Father's Wife</a></b><br>Refers to a stepmother or a father's second wife, highlighting the importance of family honor and boundaries.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, known for its immoral practices, which the Israelites were to avoid.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate lawgiver, who establishes moral and ethical standards for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/honor_and_respect.htm">Honor and Respect</a></b><br>The commandment underscores the importance of honoring family relationships and respecting the marital bond.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be distinct from the surrounding cultures, which often practiced immorality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Engaging in prohibited relationships brings dishonor and can lead to familial and societal breakdown.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/new_testament_continuity.htm">New Testament Continuity</a></b><br>The principles of sexual purity and respect for family boundaries are consistent throughout Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_integrity.htm">Personal Integrity</a></b><br>Believers are called to uphold integrity in all relationships, reflecting God's holiness in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_8_on_family_sanctity.htm">How does Leviticus 18:8 emphasize the sanctity of family relationships and boundaries?

Here we have an instance where the phrase "to uncover the nakedness" denotes both illicit commerce and incestuous marriage. Accordingly the administrators of the law during the second Temple defined it as follows; a man's father's wife is for ever prohibited, whether she be simply betrothed or married to his father, whether she be divorced or not, whether she be a widow or not; all connection with her on the part of the father's son is forbidden. If he lie with her while her husband is alive, he is doubly guilty, first, because she is near of kin, and secondly, because she is another man's wife. This, therefore, includes the sin of Reuben with Bilhah, his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel dwelled in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:">Genesis 35:22</a>), and of Absalom with the wives of his father (<a href="/context/2_samuel/16-20.htm" title="Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.">2Samuel 16:20-23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-17.htm" title="And he said, Speak, I pray you, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say you no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.">1Kings 2:17</a>), which was not incestuous marriage but adultery, since their husbands were alive and the wives were not divorced from them, as well as the sin practised among some of the Christians in Corinth, which consisted in sons actually marrying their divorced stepmothers in the lifetime of their fathers, and which the Apostle denounced with such severity (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1-4</a>). Among the ancient Arabs, marriages with stepmothers were common, and to this day among some tribes in Africa, when a father is unable through advanced age to attend to his young wives, he voluntarily gives them over to his eldest son. The Koran, however, like the Mosaic law, proscribes these marriages (<span class= "ital">Koran, </span>4:27).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have sexual relations with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;er&#183;wa&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6172.htm">Strong's 6172: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nakedness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your father&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
