The examination of skin diseases was a critical duty, ensuring the community's purity and health. This reflects the broader Levitical concern with holiness and cleanliness, both physically and spiritually. The term "scaly infection" likely refers to a variety of skin conditions, not just leprosy, which was a term used broadly in ancient texts.<p><b>and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin</b><br>The depth of the infection was a key diagnostic criterion. If the infection was superficial, it was less likely to be a serious condition. This reflects the biblical principle of discernment, where deeper issues often signify more serious spiritual or moral problems. The skin's surface was a metaphor for external appearances, while deeper issues required more careful examination.<p><b>and there is no black hair in it</b><br>The presence or absence of black hair was a diagnostic sign. Black hair indicated health and vitality, while white or yellow hair could signify disease. This detail underscores the meticulous nature of the priestly examination and the importance of visible signs in determining purity. Hair color as a diagnostic tool is unique to this cultural context and reflects the ancient understanding of disease.<p><b>the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days</b><br>Isolation served both as a protective measure for the community and a period of observation for the individual. The number seven is significant in biblical texts, often symbolizing completeness or divine perfection. This period allowed time for the condition to manifest more clearly, ensuring accurate diagnosis. Isolation also has spiritual implications, as it mirrors the concept of being set apart for purification and reflection, akin to the spiritual cleansing required for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests were responsible for examining skin diseases and determining the cleanliness of individuals.

A spot sitting only on the surface suggested a milder, possibly temporary condition (see <a href="/leviticus/13-20.htm">Leviticus 13:20, 31</a>).<p>&#8226; The guideline guards against panic. Not every blemish was leprosy; the priest had to rule out anything that had not penetrated beneath the skin&#8217;s outer layer.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the verse reminds us that sin, like disease, often starts beneath the surface; early, honest examination prevents deeper trouble (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there is no black hair in it</b><p>&#8226; Hair color served as another diagnostic clue. Black hair indicated health and normal growth, so its absence&#8212;or the presence of white or yellow hair&#8212;could signal serious infection (<a href="/leviticus/13-30.htm">Leviticus 13:30, 37</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest looked for objective evidence, not superstition. Clear, observable signs protected people from wrongful isolation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days</b><p>&#8226; Seven days gave the skin time to declare itself. If the spot worsened, treatment&#8212;or permanent exclusion&#8212;would follow; if it faded, the person rejoined the camp (<a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Quarantine safeguarded the whole nation without permanently branding someone who might be fine (<a href="/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in the New Testament, Jesus honors this system by sending healed lepers to &#8220;show yourselves to the priests&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12-14</a>), underscoring God&#8217;s consistent concern for public health and holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-31.htm">Leviticus 13:31</a> lays out a gracious, orderly process: the priest carefully inspects a questionable skin spot; if it sits only on the surface and lacks alarming signs, the person lives apart for one week while the condition proves harmless or dangerous. The verse upholds personal dignity, community safety, and the principle that God&#8217;s law addresses real-life needs with wisdom, compassion, and precision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">It be not in sight deeper than the skin.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">its appearance is not deeper than the other skin. </span>If the first symptom which manifests itself in the depression of the affected spot is absent.<p><span class= "bld">And that there is no black hair in it.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">but there is no black hair in it; </span>that is, the healthy black colour of the hair is absent, which is a suspicious sign. The phrase, "there is no black hair in it," is another way of saying "there is yellow hair in it." The presence of yellow hair, however, on the first inspection, though suspicious, did not necessarily indicate by itself leprosy, since the hair sometimes turned yellow temporarily in the case of an ordinary ulcer, and resumed its natural black colour when the patient returned to his usual health. Hence, the absence of the black hair was simply a suspicious symptom, which required the attention of the priest, for which reason the patient had to be put in quarantine for seven days. The alteration of the word "black" into "yellow," which has been adopted by those commentators who follow the LXX.,is therefore unnecessary. Indeed, if this reading be adopted, both the unfavourable symptoms mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/13-30.htm" title="Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scale, even a leprosy on the head or beard.">Leviticus 13:30</a>, which indicate leprosy--viz., (1) the depression of the affected spot, and (2) the discolouring of the hair--would be absent. There would be no reason for quarantine, as the priest in the absence of these criteria would have to pronounce the man clean. (See <a href="/leviticus/13-37.htm" title="But if the scale be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scale is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.">Leviticus 13:37</a>.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
