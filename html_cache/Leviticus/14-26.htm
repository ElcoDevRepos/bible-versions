Priests acted as mediators between God and the people, performing rituals and sacrifices to maintain the covenant relationship. This specific instruction highlights the priest's duty in the purification process, emphasizing the importance of ritual purity in maintaining holiness within the community.<br><br>*is to pour some of the oil*<br>Oil in the Old Testament often symbolizes the Holy Spirit, anointing, and consecration. In the context of <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>, oil is used in the purification ritual for a person healed of a skin disease, signifying restoration and sanctification. The use of oil in this ritual can be seen as a type of the anointing of the Holy Spirit, which cleanses and empowers believers in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<br><br>*into his left palm*<br>The specific mention of the left palm may indicate a practical aspect of the ritual, as the priest would use his right hand to apply the oil. This detail underscores the precision and care required in the priestly duties, reflecting the order and holiness expected in worship. The left hand, often considered the weaker hand, may also symbolize humility and service, aligning with the priest's role as a servant of God and the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A central figure in the Levitical law, responsible for performing rituals and sacrifices.
