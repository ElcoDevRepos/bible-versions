This is seen in the context of circumcision (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>) and the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). The eighth day marks the completion of the cleansing process, symbolizing a fresh start for the individual.<p><b>he is to bring them for his cleansing</b><br>The act of bringing offerings for cleansing underscores the importance of personal responsibility in the process of purification. This reflects the broader biblical theme of repentance and atonement, where individuals must actively seek reconciliation with God. The offerings typically include two birds, a grain offering, and oil, symbolizing various aspects of atonement and thanksgiving.<p><b>to the priest</b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between God and man, a role that foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The priest's involvement emphasizes the necessity of divine authority in the process of cleansing and forgiveness.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It represents God's presence among His people and serves as a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem. The entrance signifies accessibility to God, yet also the need for proper preparation and purification before approaching Him.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the presence and authority of God in the cleansing process. It underscores the belief that all acts of worship and purification are ultimately directed towards God. The presence of the LORD at the Tent of Meeting signifies His willingness to dwell among His people and to provide a means for their purification and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between the individual seeking cleansing and God.
