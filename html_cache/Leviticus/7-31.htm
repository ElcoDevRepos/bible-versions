The fat, considered the best part of the animal, was reserved for God, symbolizing the offering of the best to Him. This act of burning the fat was a fragrant aroma to the Lord, as seen in other passages like <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>. The altar, located in the Tabernacle, was the central place of sacrifice and worship for the Israelites, representing God's presence among His people. The burning of the fat also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God.<p><b>but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons</b><br>The breast of the sacrificial animal was given to Aaron and his sons, the priestly family, as their portion. This provision was part of God's system to support the priests, who had no inheritance of land like the other tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). The breast, often associated with love and affection, symbolizes the close relationship between God and His priests. This allocation also highlights the principle of sharing and provision within the community of faith. The priesthood of Aaron and his sons points to the priesthood of Christ, who is our eternal High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest is responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals, acting as a mediator between God and the people.

The fat represents the richest, choicest part of the animal, underscoring that the Lord deserves the best.<p>&#8226; By turning the fat to smoke, the priest visually demonstrates total surrender to God, much like the rising incense of prayer (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>) and the &#8220;pleasing aroma&#8221; language woven through the offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Treating the fat as holy protects worshipers from the self-centeredness condemned in <a href="/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15&#8211;17</a>, where Eli&#8217;s sons seized the fat for themselves.<p>&#8226; The directive also prefigures the perfect sacrifice of Christ, who offered Himself fully to the Father (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), showing that wholehearted devotion, not partial loyalty, is the Lord&#8217;s rightful portion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons</b><p>&#8220;but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>).<p>&#8226; God provides for His priests through specific portions of the fellowship offering&#8212;the wave-breast here, and the right thigh in verse 32 (see also <a href="/leviticus/7-34.htm">Leviticus 7:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-26.htm">Exodus 29:26&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The breast is waved before the Lord, acknowledging that it first belongs to Him, then handed to the priests. This balance affirms both divine ownership and priestly sustenance.<p>&#8226; By sustaining those who serve at the altar, God embeds the principle later restated in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a>: &#8220;those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The arrangement also fosters community. Worshipers, priests, and the Lord all share in the peace offering meal (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>). The breast&#8217;s allocation models generous support for spiritual leaders (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17&#8211;18</a>), while still keeping God first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a> highlights two complementary truths: the Lord receives the choicest portion, and His servants are cared for from what is offered. Burning the fat proclaims God&#8217;s supreme worth; giving the breast to Aaron&#8217;s line ensures the ongoing ministry of the priesthood. Together they call believers to honor God with their very best and to faithfully support those who minister in His name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/7-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
