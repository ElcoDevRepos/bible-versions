In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the laying on of hands was a common practice to confer blessing, authority, or in this case, the symbolic transfer of guilt. This ritual is part of the Day of Atonement, a significant event in the Jewish calendar, emphasizing the need for purification and reconciliation with God.<p><b>and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins.</b><br>Confession here involves acknowledging specific sins, which underscores the comprehensive nature of atonement. The terms "iniquities," "rebellious acts," and "sins" cover a wide range of moral failings, indicating that no sin is too great to be confessed and atoned for. This practice highlights the importance of repentance and the acknowledgment of wrongdoing as prerequisites for forgiveness.<p><b>He is to put them on the goat&#8217;s head</b><br>The act of placing sins on the goat's head signifies the complete removal of sin from the community. This is a vivid illustration of substitutionary atonement, where the goat bears the sins of the people. This concept foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity on the cross, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>.<p><b>and send it away into the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of desolation and separation, symbolizing the removal of sin from the community. This act ensures that the sins are not only forgiven but also forgotten, as they are carried far away from the people. The wilderness is often depicted in Scripture as a place of testing and purification, further emphasizing the cleansing aspect of this ritual.<p><b>by the hand of a man appointed for the task.</b><br>The selection of a specific individual to lead the goat into the wilderness ensures that the task is carried out with precision and care. This appointed man acts as a mediator, ensuring the complete removal of sin. This role can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, as described in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest who performs the ritual of atonement for the Israelites.

The rite proclaims God&#8217;s justice&#8212;sin must be punished&#8212;and His mercy&#8212;He provides a substitute. Each movement anticipates the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus, who carried our sins outside the city so we might be reconciled to God forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And Aaron shall lay both his hands.</span>--With the imposition of "both his hands," a phrase which only occurs in this ceremony, the high priest indicated in the most solemn manner possible that the animal was intended both for the priesthood and for the laity.<p><span class= "bld">And confess over him all the iniquities.</span>--This confession, which was at first extempore, was formulated during" the second Temple as follows: "O Lord, thy people, the house of Israel, have sinned, and done iniquity, and transgressed before thee. O Lord, I beseech thee, cover over the sins, the iniquities and the transgressions that thy people, the house of Israel, have sinned, have done iniquitously, and have transgressed before thee, as it is written in the Law of thy servant Moses" (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm" title="For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.">Leviticus 16:30</a>). The priests and the people who stood in the court when they heard the high priest utter the Ineffable name, Jehovah--which in the time of Christ was only pronounced on this day, and that by the pontiff--prostrated themselves, and with their faces to the ground responded, "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever."<p><span class= "bld">Putting them upon the head of the goat.--</span>By this imposition of hands, and the confession, the high priest transferred the sins of the nation to the goat. He then turned to the people, and declared, "Ye shall be clean."<p><span class= "bld">Send him away by the hand of a fit man.</span>--The guilt-laden animal was then entrusted to a man previously appointed, to be conducted to the lonely region, the abode of Azazel, thus carrying back to him the sins which he enticed the people to commit during the year. The phrase which is here rendered by "a fit man," and which occurs nowhere else in the Bible, denotes more properly <span class= "ital">a timely man, a man at hand, </span>one appointed for the occasion. The marginal rendering, "a man of opportunity," is still more objectionable.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [he]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1436;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is to lay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;s&#257;&#183;ma&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
