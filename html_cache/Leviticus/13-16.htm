The change from raw flesh to white indicates a healing process. In ancient Israel, skin diseases were not only medical concerns but also had significant religious implications, as they could render a person ceremonially unclean. The transformation of the skin signifies a potential restoration to purity and community life. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and cleansing from sin, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. The change in skin condition can be likened to the transformation believers undergo through sanctification, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, where the old self is made new.<p><b>he must go to the priest</b><br>The role of the priest in ancient Israel extended beyond religious rituals to include health inspections, as they were responsible for determining ceremonial cleanliness. This reflects the intertwining of physical and spiritual health in the Israelite community. The priest acted as a mediator between God and the people, a role that foreshadows the mediatory work of Jesus Christ, our High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>. The requirement to go to the priest underscores the importance of community and accountability in the process of restoration. It also highlights the need for divine authority in declaring someone clean, pointing to the ultimate authority of Christ in forgiving sins and restoring individuals to spiritual health.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests were responsible for religious rituals and maintaining the purity of the community.

The same pattern appears here: if a change occurs, a new response is required.<p>&#8226; Though the prior state looked hopeless, the &#8220;but&#8221; reminds us that God leaves room for restoration, echoing the mercy glimpsed in <a href="/numbers/12-13.htm">Numbers 12:13&#8211;15</a> when Moses interceded for Miriam&#8217;s leprosy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the raw flesh changes</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Raw flesh&#8221; (see <a href="/leviticus/13-14.htm">Leviticus 13:14</a>) exposed living tissue, symbolizing ongoing impurity and even living death (<a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;change&#8221; signals a halt in the disease&#8217;s advance and hints at God-given healing.
