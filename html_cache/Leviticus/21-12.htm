The sanctuary, or tabernacle, was the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. The high priest's role was to mediate between God and the people, and leaving the sanctuary could symbolize a break in this sacred duty. The term "desecrate" implies that any departure from the prescribed rituals and presence could defile the holy place, which was set apart for divine worship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from the profane, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>, where the high priest wears a turban inscribed with "Holy to the LORD."<p><b>for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him</b><br>The anointing oil signifies the high priest's consecration and divine appointment. This oil, described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>, was a sacred mixture used exclusively for anointing the tabernacle and its furnishings, as well as the priests. The oil represents the Holy Spirit's presence and empowerment, setting the high priest apart for his unique role. The anointing marks the high priest as holy, dedicated to God's service, and unable to engage in activities that would compromise his sanctity. This consecration is a type of Christ, the Anointed One, who fulfills the ultimate high priestly role as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>I am the LORD</b><br>This declaration underscores God's authority and the divine origin of the commandments. It serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to His laws is an expression of faithfulness. The phrase "I am the LORD" appears frequently in Leviticus, reinforcing the idea that the laws are not arbitrary but are grounded in God's character and His desire for His people to reflect His holiness. This statement also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's self-revelation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God reveals His name to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM," establishing His eternal and unchanging nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, the high priest is set apart for special duties and must adhere to strict regulations to maintain holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place where the high priest serves, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing_oil.htm">The Anointing Oil</a></b><br>Symbolizes the consecration and setting apart of the high priest for God's service.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who establishes these laws to maintain the holiness of His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom these laws are given, called to be a holy people set apart for God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The high priest's life was marked by separation from common activities to maintain holiness.

When the tidings of the death of a parent is brought to him during the service, he must not desist from the service and quit the sanctuary, lest it should appear that he has a greater regard for the dead than for the service of the living God. The difference between the ordinary priest and the high priest in this respect was, that when the former heard, during the service, of the death of any one of the seven relations for whom he had to mourn, he was obliged to discontinue the service, though he too could not leave the precincts of the sanctuary; whilst the former, under these circumstances, was bound to continue the service. The former, by becoming a mourner, profaned the service if he continued it; the latter never became a mourner, and hence profaned the service if he discontinued it.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">leave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or desecrate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2490.htm">Strong's 2490: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bore, to wound, to dissolve, to profane, to break, to begin, to play</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sanctuary</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;da&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4720.htm">Strong's 4720: </a> </span><span class="str2">A consecrated thing, place, a palace, sanctuary, asylum</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
