In the context of Leviticus, sacred offerings were meant to be consumed only by those who were ritually clean and authorized, primarily the priests. Allowing unauthorized individuals to eat these offerings would desecrate what was holy. This reflects the broader biblical principle of maintaining the sanctity of what is dedicated to God, as seen in the story of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and the warning against profaning holy things (<a href="/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>).<p><b>and thus to bear the punishment for guilt.</b><br>The consequence of improperly consuming sacred offerings was bearing the punishment for guilt, which underscores the seriousness of maintaining holiness and obedience to God's commands. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin leading to guilt and the need for atonement, as seen in the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus. The concept of bearing guilt is also echoed in the New Testament, where Christ bears the sins of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>), highlighting the gravity of sin and the need for a mediator.<p><b>For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's role in sanctification, setting apart the Israelites and their practices as holy. The declaration "I am the LORD" is a frequent reminder of God's authority and covenant relationship with Israel. Sanctification is a central theme throughout Scripture, pointing to God's desire for His people to be holy as He is holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Christ, who sanctifies believers through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).

Just before verse 16, God lays down boundaries about who may eat portions of the sacrifices (vv. 10-15). &#8220;No one outside a priest&#8217;s family is to eat the sacred offering&#8221; (v. 10), yet certain family members who meet purity standards may share in it (vv. 12-13). The verse we are studying serves as the bottom line that ties the whole section together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sacred offerings</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;sacred offerings&#8221; are those portions of grain, animal, or fellowship sacrifices set apart for the priests (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>).<p>&#8226; What made them sacred was not the priests&#8217; need for food but God&#8217;s prior claim on them (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Mishandling these offerings wasn&#8217;t a minor slip; it meant treating what was holy as common, an offense God repeatedly warns against (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>, <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Allowing the people to eat</b><p><a href="/leviticus/22-16.htm">Leviticus 22:16</a> says, &#8220;or allow the people to eat the sacred offerings and so bear the punishment for guilt.&#8221; The priests were gatekeepers.

If the priests let the wrong people eat, God placed the guilt squarely on the priests themselves (<a href="/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The consequence could involve removal from priestly service or even death, as earlier with Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice is consistent: &#8220;The soul who sins shall die&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>), yet He always issues warnings before judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;For I am the LORD who sanctifies them&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God alone makes something&#8212;or someone&#8212;holy (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). Priests were to reflect, not manufacture, that holiness.<p>&#8226; The statement roots the entire command in God&#8217;s character.
