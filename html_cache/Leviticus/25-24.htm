The land was not merely a commodity but a sacred trust. This phrase emphasizes the communal and covenantal nature of land ownership in Israel. The land ultimately belonged to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>), and the Israelites were stewards of His creation. This stewardship principle is echoed in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given dominion over the earth. The idea of land as a divine inheritance is also seen in the division of Canaan among the tribes in the book of Joshua.<p><b>you must provide for the redemption of the land</b><br>The concept of redemption here refers to the practice of the kinsman-redeemer, where a family member could buy back property that had been sold due to economic hardship. This ensured that land remained within the family and tribe, preserving the inheritance given by God. The Year of Jubilee, described earlier in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, was a time when all land was to be returned to its original owners, symbolizing God's provision and mercy. This redemption process foreshadows the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from sin and restores us to our intended inheritance as children of God (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).
