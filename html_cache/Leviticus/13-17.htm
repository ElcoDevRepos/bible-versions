This role highlights the integration of spiritual and physical well-being in the community. The priest's reexamination signifies a thorough and careful process, ensuring that the person is truly healed. This reflects the importance of discernment and careful judgment in leadership roles.<p><b>and if the infection has turned white</b><br>The change in color of the infection was a key indicator of healing. White often symbolizes purity and cleansing in biblical texts. This transformation can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and forgiveness, where sin, once red like scarlet, becomes white as snow (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p><b>the priest is to pronounce the infected person clean</b><br>The pronouncement of cleanliness by the priest was crucial for the individual's reintegration into the community. This act underscores the authority of the priesthood and the importance of communal acceptance. It also prefigures the role of Jesus as the ultimate high priest who declares believers clean from sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>then he is clean</b><br>The declaration of cleanliness is both a physical and spiritual restoration. It signifies the end of isolation and the beginning of a new life within the community.
