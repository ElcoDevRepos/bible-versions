A priest's daughter, upon marriage, would typically become part of her husband's household. However, if she became widowed or divorced and had no children, she would return to her father's house. This reflects the patriarchal structure of society, where a woman's identity and provision were closely tied to the male figures in her life. The absence of children is significant, as children would have provided her with a means of support and a place within her husband's family.<p><b>and returns to her father&#8217;s house</b><br>Returning to her father's house signifies a restoration of her previous status within her family of origin. This return is not merely physical but also legal and social, as she re-assumes her place under her father's protection and provision. This practice underscores the importance of family as a safety net in ancient Israelite culture, ensuring that vulnerable individuals, such as widows and divorcees, were cared for.<p><b>she may share her father&#8217;s food as in her youth</b><br>The sharing of food indicates her reintegration into the household. In the context of a priestly family, this food would include portions of the offerings and sacrifices designated for the priest's household. This provision is a form of sustenance and a symbol of belonging. The reference to "as in her youth" suggests a return to her original status before marriage, highlighting the cyclical nature of her life journey and the enduring responsibility of the family to care for its members.<p><b>But no outsider may share it</b><br>This restriction emphasizes the sanctity and exclusivity of the priestly provisions. The food designated for the priest's family was considered holy, set apart for those within the covenant community. An "outsider" refers to anyone not part of the priestly family, underscoring the boundaries that maintained the purity and order of the priestly duties. This principle of separation is echoed throughout Leviticus, reflecting the broader theme of holiness and the distinct identity of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

a very specific scenario: &#8220;But if a priest&#8217;s daughter with no children becomes widowed or divorced &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-13.htm">Leviticus 22:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God makes compassionate provision for a woman who has lost her husband and has no offspring to provide for her.<p>&#8226; While marriage carried economic security in ancient Israel, widowhood or divorce could leave a woman vulnerable (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting &#8220;no children,&#8221; the text explains why she may need to rely on her father&#8217;s household again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Returning to her father&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8226; Next, the daughter &#8220;returns to her father&#8217;s house&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-13.htm">Leviticus 22:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This return restores her place under her father&#8217;s protection and authority, much like Tamar was invited to remain in her father&#8217;s house after tragedy (<a href="/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>) and Naomi urged her daughters-in-law to go back to their families for security (<a href="/ruth/1-8.htm">Ruth 1:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture affirms family responsibility: parents care for adult children in crisis, and children honor their parents by accepting that care when needed (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sharing her father&#8217;s food as in her youth</b><p>&#8226; Once

eat that food again, God reinstates blessings she enjoyed when she was under her father&#8217;s roof as a child.<p>&#8226; This underscores the unbroken covenant privilege tied to her birth in a priestly family (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No outsider may share it</b><p>&#8226; The final safeguard: &#8220;But no outsider may share it&#8221;

non-priestly line (<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-9.htm">Ezekiel 44:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The holiness of the offerings remains protected; compassion never overrides God&#8217;s standards.<p>&#8226; This balance&#8212;grace toward the daughter, boundaries for outsiders&#8212;keeps worship pure while meeting genuine need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/22-13.htm">Leviticus 22:13</a> shows God&#8217;s heart for vulnerable family members within the priestly line. A childless priest&#8217;s daughter, bereft of husband and support, may return home and once again partake of the sacred food that sustained her when young. Yet the privilege stays within covenant bounds; outsiders remain excluded. The verse blends compassion with holiness, illustrating how God cares for His people without compromising the sanctity of His offerings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Be a widow, or divorced, and have no child.</span>--An exception, however, to this rule is, when the priest's married daughter loses her husband either by death or by divorce, and has no children; under such circumstances she may resume her family ties under her paternal roof. Having lost her bread supplier, she may eat again her father's bread. She could, however, only eat of the heave-offerings, but not of the wave-breast and heave-shoulder.<p><span class= "bld">Returned unto her father's house, as</span> <span class= "ital"><span class= "bld">in </span>her youth.<span class= "ital"></span></span>--As an inference from these words, two canons were enacted during the second Temple. (1) If thus left a widow without children, her departed husband has a surviving brother, who, according to the law, must marry his sister-in-law (see <a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife: it is your brother's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:16</a>), and she is reserved for him, she cannot partake of the holy things, though she has temporarily "returned unto her father's house." Hence the Chaldee version renders this clause, "returned to her father's house, and is not reserved for her husband's brother." And (2) if she is with child at the death of her husband, and on her return home, she must not eat of the holy things. If the child dies she then is permitted to be incorporated again in her father's family.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/22-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a priest&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">daughter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;a&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
