The eighth year follows the Sabbath year, a year of rest for the land as commanded in <a href="/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4</a>. This practice underscores the importance of trusting in God's provision, as the Israelites were to refrain from sowing and reaping during the seventh year. The eighth year marks the resumption of agricultural activities, symbolizing renewal and faith in God's continued sustenance.<p><b>you will be eating from the previous harvest</b><br>This highlights God's promise of provision. During the Sabbath year, the Israelites were not to plant or harvest, yet God assured them that the sixth year's yield would be abundant enough to sustain them through the seventh year and into the eighth. This miraculous provision is reminiscent of the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16), where God supplied the Israelites' needs despite natural limitations. It emphasizes reliance on divine provision rather than human effort.<p><b>until the ninth year&#8217;s harvest comes in</b><br>The ninth year represents the completion of a cycle and the return to normal agricultural practices. The phrase indicates a period of transition where the Israelites continue to depend on God's provision until the new harvest is ready. This cycle of dependence and renewal can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). The concept of waiting for the harvest also connects to the New Testament theme of spiritual sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>), encouraging believers to trust in God's timing and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai, including the instructions in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given.

Obedience therefore precedes visible results&#8212;mirroring <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-5</a>, where Israel gathered manna exactly as instructed before they saw how God would provide.<p>&#8226; This line underscores faith-filled action: plows hit the soil even though no immediate food is coming in, echoing <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>&#8217;s link between faith and deeds and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>&#8217;s call to walk by faith, not by sight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will be eating from the previous harvest</b><p>&#8226; God promises tangible provision: &#8220;you will be eating from the previous harvest&#8221;. This assures Israel that the bumper crop of the sixth year (<a href="/leviticus/25-21.htm">Leviticus 25:21</a>) will stretch across years seven and eight.<p>&#8226; The principle repeats God&#8217;s earlier pattern of sustaining His people supernaturally, like the manna that lasted over the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22-26</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s unending jar of flour (<a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it illustrates <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;My God will supply all your needs,&#8221; and <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>&#8212;seek first His kingdom, and needs are met.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the ninth year&#8217;s harvest comes in</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s provision is not short-lived; it spans the entire gap &#8220;until the ninth year&#8217;s harvest comes in.&#8221; The promise covers roughly two full harvest cycles, showcasing His long-term faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Waiting through the eighth year for the ninth year&#8217;s crops meant trusting God with timing. <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a> urges, &#8220;Wait for the LORD; be strong,&#8221; and <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> tells us we will reap &#8220;at the proper time&#8221; if we do not give up.<p>&#8226; The planned rhythm of rest and supply foreshadows the ultimate rest in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), where believers cease striving and rely on His finished work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/25-22.htm">Leviticus 25:22</a> guarantees Israel that obedience to God&#8217;s command to rest the land will never jeopardize their survival. They are to sow in year eight even while still eating year six&#8217;s produce, carrying them safely to year nine&#8217;s harvest. The verse spotlights three truths: act in faith before results appear; trust God&#8217;s ongoing, practical provision; and wait confidently for His perfect timing. The same God who sustained Israel for two harvest cycles remains fully able to meet His people&#8217;s needs today, rewarding trustful obedience with overflowing sufficiency.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And when ye shall sow in the eighth year, ye shall yet eat of the old produce, </span>that is, when at the termination of the sabbatical year the Israelites resume the cultivation of the soil in the eighth year, the abundant crop of the sixth year--the year preceding the sabbatical year--will not only suffice for this year, but will reach till that part of the ninth year when the crops sown in the eighth are ripe and gathered in.

The special Divine interposition which is here promised to meet the requirements of one year's cessation from cultivating the land will, as a matter of course, be all the more readily vouchsafed when the Israelites will have to exercise greater obedience and faith in the jubile, and abstain two successive years from tilling the ground.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While you are sowing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;z&#601;&#183;ra&#8216;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
