His role is crucial in conveying God's instructions, highlighting the importance of obedience to divine commands. This reflects the broader biblical theme of prophetic leadership, as seen in figures like Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>).<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the Tetragrammaton, YHWH, the covenant name of God. This emphasizes the personal and relational aspect of God with Israel. It underscores the authority and divine origin of the instructions, linking back to God's covenant promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1-8</a>).<p><b>has commanded</b><br>The concept of divine command is central to the covenant relationship. God's commands are not arbitrary but are given for the well-being and holiness of His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative where obedience to God's commands is a sign of faithfulness, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>).<p><b>to be done.&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on action ("to be done") highlights the practical aspect of faith. It is not enough to hear God's commands; they must be enacted. This anticipates the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, where believers are called to be doers of the word. The specific context here involves the consecration of Aaron and his sons, a type of Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>), foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment of priestly duties in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate His laws and commandments.

Earlier Scripture highlights the same pattern: &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>), and in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a> he reminds Israel that he &#8220;stood between the LORD and you at that time to declare to you the word of the LORD.&#8221; What we see here is consistent leadership:<p>&#8226; He listens before he leads.<p>&#8226; He relays, never editing or diluting the message.<p>&#8226; His words carry weight only because they echo God&#8217;s prior word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the LORD has commanded</b><p>The phrase fixes everyone&#8217;s attention on divine authority, not human preference. Similar statements ring through Leviticus: &#8220;This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37-38</a>). Moses is underscoring that the upcoming ordination rites originate with the LORD. That truth safeguards Israel from inventing its own worship (cf. <a href="/exodus/35-1.htm">Exodus 35:1-4</a>) and foreshadows Jesus&#8217; insistence, &#8220;I do exactly what the Father has commanded Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>). The emphasis lies here: God speaks; His people obey.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To be done</b><p>Revelation demands response. The Lord&#8217;s instructions in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> will shape every act&#8212;washing, robing, anointing, sacrificing. In <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> we are told, &#8220;Be doers of the word and not hearers only.&#8221; Jesus echoes the same ethic: &#8220;Everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them will be like a wise man&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>). The sacrificial system itself points forward to Christ, who fulfilled every requirement through action, &#8220;having become obedient to death&#8212;even death on a cross&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-5.htm">Leviticus 8:5</a> spotlights three linked realities: a faithful messenger (Moses), an unchanging authority (the LORD&#8217;s command), and an expected obedience (&#8220;to be done&#8221;). God still communicates clearly through His Word, and the proper response remains the same&#8212;hear, trust, and do what He has said.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">This is the thing which the Lord commanded.</span>--That is, these are the instructions which are given in <a href="/context/exodus/29-1.htm" title="And this is the thing that you shall do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,">Exodus 29:1-37</a>, and which Moses now published to the assembled representatives of the people.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
