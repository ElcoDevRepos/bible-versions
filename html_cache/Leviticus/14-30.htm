The use of turtledoves or young pigeons highlights the provision for those who are economically disadvantaged, as these birds were more affordable than larger animals like lambs or goats. This reflects God's compassion and inclusivity, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their financial status, could participate in the sacrificial system and maintain a right relationship with Him. The use of birds in sacrifices is also seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9</a> and <a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14</a>, indicating their established role in Israelite worship practices.<p><b>whichever he can afford</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of equity in the sacrificial system. It acknowledges the varying economic capabilities of individuals and allows for a sliding scale of offerings. This provision is a testament to the fairness and justice inherent in the Mosaic Law, ensuring that no one is excluded from worship due to poverty. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching that God values the heart and intent behind the offering more than the material value, as seen in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>, where Jesus commends the widow's offering. This principle of affordability and accessibility in worship is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing that God desires a relationship with all people, regardless of their material wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a crucial role in the purification process, acting as a mediator

Mean</div><b>Then he must sacrifice</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Then&#8221; looks back to the cleansing rites already performed for the person healed of the skin disease (<a href="/leviticus/14-19.htm">Leviticus 14:19&#8211;29</a>). God does not leave cleansing half-finished; the ritual moves steadily toward restored fellowship.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Must&#8221; reminds us that the shedding of blood is not optional for forgiveness (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). The Lord required a life to stand in place of the one who had been unclean, foreshadowing the certainty of Christ&#8217;s substitutionary death (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Sacrifice signals that sin and impurity carry a cost. Every time Israel saw a bird offered, they witnessed afresh the seriousness of defilement and the mercy that allows a substitute (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the turtledoves or young pigeons</b><p>&#8226; Birds were the prescribed offerings for those who could not bring larger animals (<a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14</a>; 5:7). Their gentle, harmless nature pictures innocence transferred to the worshiper.<p>&#8226; The pair&#8212;turtledoves or pigeons&#8212;gave flexibility. Either species met God&#8217;s requirement, showing that He is not interested in display but in obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary and Joseph brought these very birds when presenting Jesus at the temple (<a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>), linking the humble bird offering to the arrival of the ultimate, once-for-all sacrifice (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whichever he can afford</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores the Lord&#8217;s compassion.

He receives what a person truly has, not what he does not have (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By allowing a range of offerings, the law anticipated the gospel&#8217;s universality. Rich and poor alike find the same access through Jesus, &#8220;who though He was rich&#8230;became poor for your sake&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-30.htm">Leviticus 14:30</a> shows that cleansing from impurity always moves toward a blood sacrifice, yet God graciously lowers the threshold so every repentant person can come.
