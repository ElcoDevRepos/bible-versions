The act of placing someone in custody indicates a temporary holding situation, reflecting the seriousness of the offense. In ancient Israel, the community was responsible for maintaining order and justice, and this custody was a way to ensure that the matter was handled according to God's law. This reflects the communal nature of justice in Israelite society, where the community played a role in upholding divine law.<p><b>until the will of the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the theocratic nature of Israelite governance, where God's will was the ultimate authority. The Israelites sought divine guidance in matters of law and justice, emphasizing their dependence on God for direction. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's will is sought in decision-making, as seen in other instances such as the Urim and Thummim used by the high priest to discern God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>).<p><b>should be made clear to them</b><br>The need for clarity from God highlights the importance of divine revelation in the administration of justice. This reflects the belief that human wisdom is insufficient without God's guidance. The process of seeking clarity from God can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as Moses seeking God's guidance in difficult situations (<a href="/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15-16</a>). This also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on seeking God's will through prayer and the guidance of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is responsible for conveying God's laws and judgments to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_camp.htm">The Israelite Camp</a></b><br>The setting where the events of <a href="/leviticus/24-12.htm">Leviticus 24:12</a> take place, representing the community of God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blasphemer.htm">The Blasphemer</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who has committed the act of blasphemy, leading to the need for divine judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose laws and commands are central to the account and whose judgment is sought.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The place where Moses would often go to seek God's guidance and where the LORD's presence was manifested.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god's_guidance.htm">The Importance of Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>In times of uncertainty or when faced with difficult decisions, it is crucial to seek God's wisdom and direction, just as Moses did.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_blasphemy.htm">The Seriousness of Blasphemy</a></b><br>Blasphemy is a grave sin that requires serious consideration and response.
