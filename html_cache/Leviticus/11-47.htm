The distinction between clean and unclean is a central theme in Leviticus, reflecting God's holiness and the call for His people to be set apart. The concept of clean and unclean extends beyond dietary laws to include moral and spiritual purity. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ fulfills the law, and the distinction becomes a metaphor for spiritual discernment (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>). The call to distinguish is a call to holiness, reflecting God's nature and His desire for His people to live in a way that honors Him.<p><b>between animals that may be eaten and those that may not.</b><br>The dietary laws given to the Israelites served multiple purposes, including health, identity, and obedience. These laws helped to maintain the physical health of the community by avoiding animals that were more likely to carry disease. Culturally, these laws set the Israelites apart from surrounding nations, reinforcing their identity as God's chosen people. Historically, these distinctions were a daily reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. In <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, Peter's vision signifies the removal of these dietary restrictions, symbolizing the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith and the new covenant established through Christ. The laws also foreshadow the ultimate purity and holiness found in Jesus, who is the fulfillment of the law and the one who makes all things clean through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Leviticus, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator of God's laws to them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean_animals.htm">Clean and Unclean Animals</a></b><br>The focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, where God distinguishes between animals that are permissible to eat and those that are not, as part of the Israelites' dietary laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br><a href="/leviticus/11-47.htm">Leviticus 11:47</a> emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the clean and unclean, symbolizing the call for God's people to be holy and set apart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The dietary laws were a test of obedience and trust in God's wisdom, teaching us the importance of following God's commands even when we do not fully understand them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to discern between clean and unclean, Christians are called to discern between what is spiritually beneficial and harmful in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_christ.htm">Transformation through Christ</a></b><br>While the dietary laws were specific to the Israelites, they point to a greater spiritual truth fulfilled in Christ, who purifies us from within and calls us to live holy lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_11_47_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 11:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_11_47_Clean_vs_Unclean_Guide.htm">How does Leviticus 11:47 guide us in discerning between clean and unclean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_11_47_s_relevance_today.htm">What principles from Leviticus 11:47 apply to our daily decision-making today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_11_47_and_NT_purity_link.htm">How does Leviticus 11:47 connect with New Testament teachings on purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_distinguish_between_clean_unclean.htm">Why is it important to distinguish "between the unclean and the clean"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Leviticus_11_47_in_life.htm">How can we implement Leviticus 11:47 in our spiritual and physical lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_11_47_clean_vs_unclean.htm">How does Leviticus 11:47 define the distinction between clean and unclean animals?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_Leviticus_dietary_laws_vital.htm">Why were dietary laws important in Leviticus 11:47 for ancient Israelites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Is_Leviticus_11_47_relevant_for_Christians.htm">Does Leviticus 11:47 still apply to Christians today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_amos_teach_about_justice.htm">What does 'ceremonially unclean' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_acts_10_contradict_leviticus_11.htm">If Leviticus 11 is God's eternal command, why does Acts 10:9-16 appear to contradict these dietary laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/follow_old_testament_dietary_laws.htm">Should we obey Old Testament dietary laws?

That is, the design of the dietary law is to enable both the administrators of the law and the people to distinguish, by the characteristics and criteria specified above, between what is clean and unclean.<p><span class= "bld">And between the beast that may be eaten.</span>--From the fact that the same word, "beast," is used in both clauses with regard to the animal which may be eaten and the one which may not be eaten without the qualifying adjunct "clean" and "unclean," the administrators of the law during the second Temple concluded that the same clean animal is meant in both instances, under different conditions. The clean animal may be eaten when it is in a healthy state, but the same animal may not be eaten when it has organic defects, or is diseased. Hence they enacted the following canon: an animal is perfectly sound when it is capable of conceiving and bringing forth young. This is the reason why the LXX. renders the word beast here <span class= "ital">by viviparous.</span><p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must distinguish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ha&#7687;&#183;d&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
