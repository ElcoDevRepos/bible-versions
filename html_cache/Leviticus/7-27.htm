This command is reiterated in <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>. Blood is considered sacred because it represents life, which belongs to God. In the sacrificial system, blood was used for atonement, symbolizing the life given to cover sin (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The prohibition underscores the sanctity of life and the importance of respecting God's creation.<p><b>that person must be cut off from his people.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Being "cut off" from the people of Israel is a severe penalty, indicating either excommunication or divine judgment leading to death. This phrase emphasizes the seriousness of the command and the need for communal purity and obedience to God's laws. In the New Testament, the concept of being cut off is echoed in the idea of church discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11-13</a>) and the importance of maintaining holiness within the community of believers. The prohibition against eating blood also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the atonement of humanity's sins, fulfilling the sacrificial system and establishing a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the dietary laws found in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, including the prohibition against consuming blood.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices were made and where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were responsible for performing sacrifices and teaching the Israelites the laws of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which included laws and commandments that set them apart as His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>Blood represents life, and consuming it was forbidden to remind the Israelites of the sanctity of life and the life-giving power of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>This command serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's laws, even when they may not be fully understood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/separation_from_pagan_practices.htm">Separation from Pagan Practices</a></b><br>The prohibition against consuming blood distinguished the Israelites from surrounding nations, many of whom used blood in their rituals.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_provision.htm">Respect for God's Provision</a></b><br>By abstaining from blood, the Israelites acknowledged God's provision and the life He sustains.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_atonement.htm">Symbolism of Atonement</a></b><br>Blood was used in sacrifices for atonement, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, whose blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_7_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 7:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_7_27_on_blood_consumption.htm">What does Leviticus 7:27 teach about consuming blood and its consequences?
