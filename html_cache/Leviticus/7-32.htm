This instruction is part of the broader Levitical laws concerning offerings and sacrifices, which were central to Israelite worship. The right thigh, or "heave offering," was lifted up as a symbolic gesture of presenting it to God. This act of giving the right thigh signifies the best portion being set aside for the priest, who serves as a mediator between God and the people. The right side often symbolizes strength and favor in biblical literature, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, where God's right hand is described as glorious in power.<p><b>to the priest</b><br>The priesthood in Israel was established through Aaron and his descendants, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28-29</a>. Priests had the responsibility of performing sacrifices, maintaining the sanctuary, and teaching the law. By receiving the right thigh, the priests were provided for materially, allowing them to focus on their spiritual duties. This provision underscores the principle that those who serve at the altar should share in the offerings, a concept echoed in the New Testament in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>.<p><b>as a contribution</b><br>The term "contribution" here refers to a portion set aside for a specific purpose, in this case, supporting the priesthood. This reflects the broader biblical principle of giving back to God a portion of what He has provided, as seen in the practice of tithing. Contributions were a way for the Israelites to acknowledge God's provision and to support the religious leaders who facilitated their worship and spiritual life.<p><b>from your peace offering</b><br>The peace offering, or "fellowship offering," was one of the key types of sacrifices described in Leviticus. It symbolized reconciliation and communion with God, often shared in a communal meal. Unlike the burnt offering, which was entirely consumed by fire, the peace offering allowed for portions to be eaten by the offerer, the priest, and sometimes the community. This offering foreshadows the ultimate peace offering made by Jesus Christ, who reconciled humanity to God through His sacrifice, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>. The peace offering highlights themes of thanksgiving, fellowship, and the restoration of relationships, both with God and within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were set apart to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, performing sacrifices and rituals on behalf of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given the Law through Moses, including instructions for offerings and sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offerings.htm">Peace Offerings</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Levitical system that symbolized fellowship and thanksgiving to God, often shared between the offerer, the priests, and God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/right_thigh.htm">Right Thigh</a></b><br>A specific portion of the peace offering designated for the priests, symbolizing their share in the communal meal and their service to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_his_servants.htm">God's Provision for His Servants</a></b><br>The allocation of the right thigh to the priests underscores God's provision for those who serve Him.

This command is not a suggestion; it is a clear directive, echoing the Lord&#8217;s insistence that obedience proves love (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The giver is the offerer&#8212;an ordinary Israelite who has experienced God&#8217;s peace and now responds in gratitude.<p>&#8226; By requiring an act of giving, the Lord trains His people to hold their blessings with an open hand (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the right thigh</b><p>Scripture pinpoints a specific cut of meat.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;right&#8221; side represents strength and honor (<a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing the thigh&#8212;one of the weightiest, choice portions&#8212;guards against giving God leftovers (<a href="/exodus/29-22.htm">Exodus 29:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Every worshiper sees that what is set apart for God&#8217;s servants is the best, reinforcing the principle later echoed in <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the priest</b><p>God provides for those who serve at His altar.<p>&#8226; The priests own no land; their livelihood comes from the offerings (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; By handing the thigh directly to the priest, the worshiper personally participates in sustaining ministry&#8212;an Old-Testament picture of the New-Testament principle that &#8220;those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The exchange nurtures mutual gratitude: the priest blesses the giver, and the giver supports the priest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a contribution</b><p>The portion is presented as a distinct gift lifted up to God.<p>&#8226; This &#8220;contribution&#8221; (often called a heave offering) is first for the Lord, then for His servant (<a href="/exodus/29-27.htm">Exodus 29:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; It is not a tax but a worshipful acknowledgment that everything originates from God&#8217;s gracious hand (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Our giving today follows the same heart motive: &#8220;God loves a cheerful giver&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from your peace offering</b><p>The context is fellowship restored.<p>&#8226; A peace offering celebrates reconciliation with God, allowing the worshiper to share a meal in His presence (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Only after peace is secured can true generosity flow; likewise, Christ &#8220;Himself is our peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), enabling believers to give freely.<p>&#8226; The shared portions&#8212;one for God (the fat burned), one for the priest (the thigh and breast), and the remainder for the family&#8212;paint a table of communion that anticipates the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a> teaches that genuine peace with God overflows into concrete, obedient generosity.
