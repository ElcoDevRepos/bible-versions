In the context of Leviticus, it reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to His commandments results in His blessings. The turning of God's face is often associated with His presence and approval, as seen in the Aaronic blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>. It implies a personal and relational aspect of God's interaction with His people.<p><b>and make you fruitful and multiply you</b><br>This promise echoes the original blessing given to Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> and later to Noah in <a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>. It signifies not only physical multiplication but also prosperity and success in various aspects of life. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, fruitfulness was directly linked to agricultural success and the growth of families, which were seen as signs of divine favor. This promise also connects to the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>, where God promises to make Abraham exceedingly fruitful.<p><b>and I will establish My covenant with you</b><br>The covenant mentioned here refers to the Mosaic Covenant, which was established at Mount Sinai. This covenant was conditional, based on Israel's obedience to God's laws. The establishment of the covenant implies a reaffirmation and continuation of the relationship between God and Israel. It also points forward to the New Covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who establishes an eternal covenant through His sacrifice. The concept of covenant is central to understanding the biblical narrative, as it outlines the terms of the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker of the promise, emphasizing His role as the covenant-keeping God of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's promise, representing the chosen people with whom God established His covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The divine agreement between God and the Israelites, central to their identity and relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fertility_and_multiplication.htm">Fertility and Multiplication</a></b><br>Symbols of blessing and prosperity in the ancient Near Eastern context, reflecting God's favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/leviticus.htm">Leviticus</a></b><br>The book of the Bible where this verse is found, focusing on laws and holiness for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.
