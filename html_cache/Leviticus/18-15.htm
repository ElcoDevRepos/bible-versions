The prohibition against sexual relations with a daughter-in-law underscores the importance of respecting family boundaries and maintaining the sanctity of marriage. In the ancient Near Eastern context, family structures were central to societal stability, and violations of these boundaries could lead to significant social and familial discord. This command reflects the broader biblical principle of honoring family relationships, as seen in the Ten Commandments' directive to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The prohibition also aligns with the New Testament teachings on sexual purity and the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><b>She is your son&#8217;s wife;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the relational context that makes the act particularly egregious. The daughter-in-law is not just any woman but is bound to the family through marriage to the son. This relationship is meant to be respected and protected. The emphasis on her being the son's wife highlights the importance of marital fidelity and the respect owed to one's offspring and their spouses. In biblical times, marriage was a covenantal relationship, and any breach of this covenant was seen as a serious offense against God and the community. This respect for marital boundaries is echoed in the New Testament, where marriage is likened to the relationship between Christ and the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>).<p><b>you are not to have sexual relations with her.</b><br>The repetition of the prohibition serves to reinforce the seriousness of the command. It is a clear and unequivocal directive that leaves no room for ambiguity. This repetition is a common biblical technique used to emphasize the importance of a command. The clarity of this prohibition reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and the call for God's people to be set apart from the surrounding nations, who often engaged in practices that were contrary to God's laws. The call to holiness is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, culminating in the New Testament's exhortation for believers to live lives that are pleasing to God (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given to set them apart as holy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter-in-law.htm">Daughter-in-law</a></b><br>- The wife of one's son, specifically mentioned in this verse as someone with whom sexual relations are prohibited.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ethical boundaries for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>- The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the laws in Leviticus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_marriage.htm">Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God.
