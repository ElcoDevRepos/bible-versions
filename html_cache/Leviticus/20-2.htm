The Israelites are God's chosen people, set apart to live according to His laws. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God provides guidance and laws for the community's well-being.<p><b>Any Israelite or foreigner living in Israel</b><br>The inclusion of both Israelites and foreigners highlights the universal application of God's laws within the land of Israel. It reflects the expectation that anyone residing in the land, regardless of their origin, must adhere to the same standards of holiness and worship. This inclusivity ensures the purity and sanctity of the community.<p><b>Who gives any of his children to Molech</b><br>Molech was a Canaanite deity associated with child sacrifice, a practice detestable to God. This phrase indicates a severe violation of God's commandments, as it involves idolatry and the shedding of innocent blood. The prohibition against such practices is rooted in the sanctity of life and the exclusive worship of Yahweh.<p><b>Must be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment for this transgression is death, reflecting the gravity of the sin. This severe penalty serves as a deterrent and underscores the seriousness with which God views idolatry and child sacrifice. It also highlights the need for justice and the protection of the community from corrupting influences.<p><b>The people of the land are to stone him</b><br>Stoning was a communal form of execution, involving the participation of the community. This method of punishment emphasizes collective responsibility in upholding God's laws and maintaining the community's purity.

Not only was the juxtaposition and combination of the worship of Molech and Jehovah an offense to him whose name is Jealous, but at the time that Molech-worship was carried on in the valley of Hinnom, idols were set up in the court of the temple itself, as we learn from the Book of Kings and from Jeremiah. "But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my Name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which! commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin" (<a href="/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34, 35</a>). And of Manasseh it is related, "He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my Name. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire" (<a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israelite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
