Thus, in the graphic description of the idolatrous priests mourning, we are told "the priests sit in their temples, having their clothes rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads." (Bar 6:31.) The three things here prohibited to the priests are also forbidden to the people at large under other circumstances. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27-28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>.) The ordinary Israelites, however, indulged in the same practices. (See <a href="/jeremiah/16-6.htm" title="Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:">Jeremiah 16:6</a>;
