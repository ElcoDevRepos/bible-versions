During this time, they were exposed to Egyptian culture, religion, and practices, which were often contrary to the worship of Yahweh. Egypt was known for its polytheistic beliefs, idolatry, and practices that included rituals and customs that were abominable to God. The Israelites are being reminded to leave behind these influences as they transition into a new identity as God's chosen people. This command underscores the importance of spiritual separation and purity, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, where believers are called to be separate from worldly influences.<p><b>and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you</b><br>The land of Canaan, the Promised Land, was inhabited by various tribes known for their morally corrupt practices, including idolatry, child sacrifice, and sexual immorality. The Canaanites' religious practices were deeply intertwined with their daily lives, and God warned the Israelites not to adopt these customs. This command highlights the need for the Israelites to maintain their distinctiveness and holiness as a people set apart for God. The warning against adopting Canaanite practices is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>, where God explicitly instructs the Israelites to destroy the Canaanite altars and not to inquire about their gods.<p><b>You must not walk in their customs</b><br>The term "walk" in biblical language often refers to one's way of life or conduct. Here, it emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the command: the Israelites are to avoid not just specific practices but the entire lifestyle and worldview of the Egyptians and Canaanites. This call to holiness is foundational to the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, where God declares, "You are to be holy to Me because I, the LORD, am holy." This principle is carried into the New Testament, where believers are called to live according to the Spirit and not according to the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>). The call to reject the customs of surrounding nations serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and lived a life wholly pleasing to God, setting an example for believers to follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years.
