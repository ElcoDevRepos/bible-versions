The LORD, represented by the tetragrammaton YHWH, is the covenant name of God, highlighting His personal relationship with Israel. Moses, as the leader and mediator of the Israelites, is often the recipient of God's commands. This calling signifies the continuation of the divine guidance that began in Exodus, where Moses was chosen to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. The calling of Moses also prefigures the role of Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>.<p><b>and spoke to him</b><br>This phrase underscores the verbal communication between God and Moses, a common method of divine revelation in the Old Testament. The act of speaking indicates clarity and authority, ensuring that Moses receives precise instructions. This communication is foundational for the laws and rituals that will be established in Leviticus. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and His chosen leaders, similar to how God spoke to the prophets. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying God's ultimate communication to humanity.<p><b>from the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was a portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It served as the central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence and holiness. The location of this communication highlights the importance of the Tabernacle as the meeting point between God and His people. The Tent of Meeting foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and the future establishment of God's eternal dwelling with humanity in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<p><b>saying,</b><br>This introductory word sets the stage for the specific instructions that follow. It indicates that what is about to be communicated is of divine origin and carries the weight of God's authority. The use of "saying" is a common biblical formula that introduces direct speech, ensuring that the message is received as God's own words. This mirrors the way Jesus often prefaced His teachings with "Truly, I say to you," emphasizing the truth and authority of His message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting (Tabernacle)</a></b><br>A sacred place where God&#8217;s presence dwelled among the Israelites, serving as the central place of worship and communication with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_initiative_in_communication.htm">God's Initiative in Communication</a></b><br>God takes the initiative to communicate with His people, demonstrating His desire for a relationship with them.

Each phrase underscores a foundational truth: the Lord reaches out first, appoints a mediator, communicates clearly, draws near to His people, and delivers life-giving words. This verse is the doorway to the entire sacrificial system, grounding every instruction that follows in the authority, presence, and grace of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And the Lord called . . . and spake.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And he called unto Moses, and the Lord spake, &c. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a>.) At the end of the previous book we are told that when the tent of meeting was completed, the Lord showed His approbation of it by covering the outside of the edifice with a heaven-sent cloud, and by filling the inside with His glory (<a href="/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-38</a>). <span class= "ital">He </span>therefore, who had filled the sanctuary with his glory now "called unto Moses," thus indicating by "And he called," which are one word in the original, the intimate connection between the two books. The ancient Jewish synagogue already pointed out the fact that this unusual phrase, "And he called unto Moses," is used as an introductory formula on the three different occasions when the Lord made a special communication to this great law-giver. Thus when the Lord first communicated to Moses that He was about to deliver the Israelites from Egypt, "He called unto him" from the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm" title="And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.">Exodus 3:4</a>). When the Lord was about to give to Moses the Ten Commandments for the people of Israel, "He called unto him" from the top of Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-3.htm" title="And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;">Exodus 19:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-20.htm" title="And the LORD came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.">Exodus 19:20</a>); and now when the Lord is about to give to His chosen people, through His servant Moses, the laws by which their Divine worship is to be regulated, "He called unto him" from the tent of meeting (<a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,">Leviticus 1:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the LORD called unto Moses</span>. The first word of the verse, in the original <span class="accented">Vayikra</span>, meaning "and called," has been taken as the designation of the book in the Hebrew Bible. The title Leviticon, or Leviticus, was first adopted by the LXX., to indicate that it had for its main subject the duties and functions appertaining to the chief house of the priestly tribe of Levi. The word "and" connects the third with the second book of the Pentateuch. God is spoken of in this and in the next book almost exclusively under the appellation of "the LORD" or "Jehovah," the word "Elohim" being, however, used sufficiently often to identify the two names. Cf. <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, 19:12. <span class="cmt_word">And spake unto him</span>. The manner in which God ordinarily communicated with a prophet was by "a vision" or "in a dream;" but this was not the case with Moses; "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently" (<a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). The Levitical code of laws, therefore, was delivered to Moses in his ordinary mental state, not in trance, or dream, or ecstasy. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> The tabernacle had just been set up by Moses (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). It derives its name <span class="accented">of the congregation</span>, or rather <span class="accented">of meeting</span>, from being the place where God met the representatives of his people (see <a href="/numbers/16-42.htm">Numbers 16:42</a>). Hitherto God had spoken from the mount, now he speaks from the mercy-seat of the ark in the tabernacle. He had symbolically drawn near to his people, and the sacrificial system is now instituted as the means by which they should draw nigh to him. All the laws in the Book of Leviticus, and in the first ten chapters of the Book of Numbers, were given during the fifty days which intervened between the setting up of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>) and the departure of the children of Israel from the neighbourhood of Mount Sinai (<a href="/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
