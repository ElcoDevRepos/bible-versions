Offering the fat symbolized giving the best to God, acknowledging His sovereignty and provision. This practice is rooted in the belief that the fat, being the richest part, was a fitting tribute to the Lord. The emphasis on offering the fat can be seen as a call to prioritize God in one's life, giving Him the first and best of what one has. This principle is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>, which instructs believers to honor the Lord with their wealth and the firstfruits of all their produce.<p><b>the fat tail,</b><br>The fat tail refers to the fatty appendage of certain breeds of sheep, particularly those found in the Middle East. These tails could weigh several pounds and were considered a delicacy. In the context of Leviticus, the fat tail was specifically mentioned as part of the offering, highlighting its value. This detail underscores the importance of offering valuable and significant portions to God, reinforcing the idea of sacrifice as an act of worship and devotion. The specificity of the fat tail also reflects the detailed nature of the Levitical laws, which aimed to guide the Israelites in their worship practices.<p><b>the fat that covers the entrails,</b><br>The fat covering the entrails refers to the internal fat surrounding the organs of the sacrificial animal. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the entrails and the fat surrounding them were often associated with life and vitality. By offering this fat, the Israelites were symbolically dedicating the life force of the animal to God. This act of offering the internal fat can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of offering one's whole self to God, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests are responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals as outlined in Leviticus.

By commanding its complete surrender, God taught His people that He alone deserves the choicest part of every offering (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction follows God&#8217;s earlier directives that certain sacrifices were &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>).
