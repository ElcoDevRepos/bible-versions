In ancient Israel, lending money at interest to fellow Israelites was prohibited to prevent exploitation and ensure that the poor were not further burdened. This reflects God's desire for His people to care for one another and maintain social justice. The prohibition against usury is echoed in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>, highlighting its significance in maintaining community integrity. The principle can be seen as a precursor to the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and generosity towards others, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-35</a>.<p><b>or sell him your food for profit</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of providing for the needy without seeking personal gain. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, food was a basic necessity, and selling it at a profit to those in need would have been seen as taking advantage of their vulnerability. This command aligns with the broader biblical theme of caring for the poor and ensuring that everyone has access to essential resources. The idea of not profiting from the misfortune of others is consistent with the teachings of the prophets, such as Isaiah and Amos, who called for justice and righteousness. It also foreshadows the New Testament teachings on generosity and selflessness, as exemplified by Jesus' life and ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, God's chosen people who were to live according to His statutes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the laws to Moses, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbatical_year.htm">Sabbatical Year</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, which includes laws about the Sabbath year and Jubilee, emphasizing rest and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where these laws were to be practiced by the Israelites as they settled and lived there.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_generosity.htm">Principle of Generosity</a></b><br>The prohibition against charging interest underscores the importance of generosity and support within the community of believers.
