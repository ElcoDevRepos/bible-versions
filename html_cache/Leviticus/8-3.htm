The congregation likely included representatives from each tribe, symbolizing the unity of the nation under God's covenant. This assembly underscores the importance of transparency and collective witness in the consecration of Aaron and his sons, as the priesthood was established to serve the entire community. The gathering of the whole congregation also reflects the communal nature of Israel's relationship with God, as seen in other significant events such as the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>).<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. Located at the center of the Israelite camp, it was a sacred space where God communicated with Moses and where the priests performed their duties. The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a significant location for public ceremonies, symbolizing access to God's presence and the mediation of the priesthood. This setting for the assembly highlights the importance of the priestly consecration as a divinely ordained event. The Tent of Meeting prefigures the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity through Jesus Christ, who is described as the true Tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and instructions.
