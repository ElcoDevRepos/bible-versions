The right of redemption refers to the ability of an individual to regain freedom or property that had been sold due to economic hardship. This principle is grounded in the belief that the land and people ultimately belong to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). The Jubilee laws, which are detailed in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, were designed to prevent the permanent loss of family land and to ensure that individuals who had fallen into servitude could be restored to their original status. This reflects God's desire for justice and mercy within the community. Theologically, this right of redemption can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate redemption offered through Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p><b>One of his brothers may redeem him:</b><br>The provision for a family member, specifically a brother, to redeem an individual highlights the importance of family solidarity and responsibility in ancient Israelite society. This practice ensured that the family unit remained intact and that individuals were not left in perpetual servitude. The role of the kinsman-redeemer, or "goel," is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, most notably illustrated in the Book of Ruth, where Boaz acts as a redeemer for Ruth and Naomi (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-10</a>). This concept of a kinsman-redeemer is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate Redeemer. Just as a brother could redeem a family member, Christ, as our spiritual brother, redeems us, restoring us to our rightful place as children of God (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11-12</a>). This provision underscores the communal and familial nature of God's covenant with His people, emphasizing that redemption is not just an individual act but a communal responsibility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Leviticus, God's chosen people, who were given laws to live by in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society occurring every 50 years, where liberty was proclaimed, and property was restored.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/redeemer.htm">Redeemer</a></b><br>A close relative who has the responsibility or opportunity to buy back a family member sold into servitude.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws, including those in Leviticus, to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_redemption.htm">Understanding Redemption</a></b><br>The concept of redemption in <a href="/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48</a> highlights God's provision for restoration and freedom.

Whilst the heathen cannot be redeemed, and is to remain a bondman for ever, the Israelite who sells himself to a heathen may be redeemed. Indeed, according to the interpretation which obtained during the second Temple, this passage enjoins it upon his relations and the congregation to redeem him as soon as possible.
