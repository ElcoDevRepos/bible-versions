Finding lost property was not merely a matter of personal gain but involved a moral obligation to return it to its rightful owner, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1-3</a>. This reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and acting justly.<p><b>and lies about it</b><br>Lying about found property violates the commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). Truthfulness was a cornerstone of Israelite society, reflecting God's own nature as truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This act of deceit disrupts community trust and dishonors God.<p><b>and swears falsely</b><br>Swearing falsely, especially in God's name, was a serious offense, as it misused the sacred name of the Lord (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). Oaths were binding and sacred, and false swearing was seen as a direct affront to God's holiness and justice, requiring atonement.<p><b>or if he commits any such sin that a man might commit&#8212;</b><br>This phrase encompasses a broad range of potential sins, emphasizing human fallibility and the need for atonement. It highlights the comprehensive nature of the law, which addresses not only actions but also intentions and attitudes.
