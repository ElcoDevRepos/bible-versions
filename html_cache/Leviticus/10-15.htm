The "thigh of the contribution" and the "breast of the wave offering" were parts of the peace offerings. The thigh, often referred to as the "heave offering," was lifted up as a symbolic gesture of presenting it to God. The breast was waved before the Lord, signifying its dedication. This practice underscored the priests' role as mediators between God and the people, receiving sustenance from the offerings. The allocation of these portions to the priests is also seen in <a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>, highlighting the provision for those serving in the tabernacle.<p><b>together with the fat portions of the food offerings</b><br>The fat portions were considered the best parts of the animal and were always burned on the altar as an offering to God (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). This act symbolized giving the best to God, acknowledging His sovereignty and holiness. The burning of the fat was a pleasing aroma to the Lord, representing the worshiper's devotion. The separation of the fat for God and the meat for the priests illustrates the principle of honoring God first before partaking in His blessings.<p><b>to wave as a wave offering before the LORD</b><br>The wave offering involved a specific ritual where the priest would move the offering back and forth before the altar. This act symbolized presenting the offering to God and then receiving it back as a gift. The wave offering was a public declaration of God's provision and the community's dependence on Him. It also served as a reminder of God's presence among His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/29-24.htm">Exodus 29:24-26</a>, where the wave offering is part of the consecration of Aaron and his sons.<p><b>It will belong permanently to you and your children</b><br>This phrase establishes the perpetual right of the priests to these portions of the offerings. It ensured that the priests and their families were provided for, as they had no inheritance of land like the other tribes (<a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>). This provision was a practical expression of God's care for those who served Him full-time. It also foreshadows the eternal priesthood of Christ, who provides for His people continually (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p><b>as the LORD has commanded.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind the instructions. The commands regarding offerings were not merely ritualistic but were ordained by God to maintain holiness and order in worship. This obedience to God's commands is a recurring theme in Leviticus, highlighting the importance of following God's statutes precisely. It reflects the broader biblical principle that God's commands are for the good of His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>, and points to the ultimate fulfillment of the law in Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father's will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, responsible for performing the priestly duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>The priests who assist Aaron in the tabernacle duties and receive portions of the offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where offerings and sacrifices are made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wave_offering.htm">Wave Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering where parts of the sacrifice are waved before the LORD as a symbolic gesture of dedication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision_for_priests.htm">Divine Provision for Priests</a></b><br>God provides for those who serve Him.
