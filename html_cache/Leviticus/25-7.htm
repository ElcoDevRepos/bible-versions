In ancient Israel, livestock such as sheep, goats, and cattle were vital for agriculture, transportation, and food. The Sabbath year, or Shemitah, required the land to rest, and this provision ensured that animals were still cared for. This reflects God's concern for all His creation, not just humans, and aligns with <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which speaks of the righteous caring for their animals.<p><b>and the wild animals in your land</b><br>The inclusion of wild animals emphasizes the comprehensive nature of God's provision. The land's produce during the Sabbath year was not to be hoarded but left accessible for all creatures. This reflects the interconnectedness of creation and God's sovereignty over all life. It also echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, where God provides for all living beings. This provision can be seen as a precursor to the peaceable kingdom described in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where harmony exists between humans and animals.<p><b>All its growth may serve as food.</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of the land's natural yield during the Sabbath year. The produce was not to be harvested in the usual manner but left for anyone in need, including the poor and the stranger, as well as animals. This practice fostered a sense of community and reliance on God's provision. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where He instructs His followers not to worry about their needs, trusting in God's provision. The principle of rest and reliance on God during the Sabbath year points to the ultimate rest found in Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, who were to observe these commandments as part of their covenant with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the laws to Moses, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_year.htm">Sabbath Year</a></b><br>The event described in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, where the land was to rest every seventh year, and its produce was to be shared with all.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites were to enter and where they were to observe these laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for all His creation, ensuring that both livestock and wild animals have sustenance.

The verse invites trust in His abundance, compassionate stewardship of animals, and an unselfish posture toward neighbors and nature, all grounded in the conviction that everything ultimately belongs to the Lord who faithfully supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And for thy cattle.</span>--In accordance with the benign legislation which obtained during the second Temple, the administrators of the law inferred from this verse, and hence enacted, that the fruit of the seventh year may only be eaten by man at home, as long as the kind is found in the field. <span class= "ital">"</span>As long as the animals eat the same kind in the field thou mayest eat what there is of it in the house, but if the animal has consumed it all in the field thou art bound to remove this kind from the house into the field." (For the enactment which enjoins the remission of debts in the sabbatical year, see <a href="/context/deuteronomy/15-1.htm" title="At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.">Deuteronomy 15:1-3</a>.) During the second Temple the sabbatical year began on the first day of the month of Tishri, which was the beginning of the civil year. The tillage, however, and the cultivation of certain fields and gardens, were left off in the sixth year. The cultivation of corn-fields ceased from the Feast of Passover, and orchards from Pentecost of the sixth year. The reading of portions of the Law which is enjoined in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>, was assigned during the second Temple to the king. At the termination of the seventh fallow year, which coincided with the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles of the eighth year, a wooden platform was erected in the outer court of the Temple, on which the king was seated. The chief of the synagogue took the Book of the Law, and gave it to the head of the synagogue, who gave it to the head of the priests. He gave it to the high priest, and the latter handed it to the king, who stood up to receive it. He then sat down again, and read the following seven sections :--(1) <a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm" title="Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>; (2) <a href="/context/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:">Deuteronomy 6:4-8</a>; (3) <a href="/context/deuteronomy/11-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 11:13-22</a>; (4) <a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm" title="You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year.">Deuteronomy 14:22</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/15-23.htm" title="Only you shall not eat the blood thereof; you shall pour it on the ground as water.">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>; (5) <a href="/context/deuteronomy/16-12.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.">Deuteronomy 16:12-19</a>; (6) <a href="/context/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>; (7) <a href="/deuteronomy/27-1.htm" title="And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.">Deuteronomy 27:1</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/28-68.htm" title="And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spoke to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall be sold to your enemies for slaves and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>. The king concluded with the same benedictions, which the high priest pronounced (see <a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm" title="And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp;
