The chapter details blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The phrase "in spite of all this" highlights the persistence of Israel's rebellion despite numerous warnings and punishments. This reflects the human tendency to resist divine correction, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the repeated cycles of sin and repentance in the Book of Judges.<p><b>you do not obey Me</b><br>Obedience to God is a central theme in the Mosaic Law, representing faithfulness to the covenant. The Hebrew concept of obedience involves hearing and responding to God's commands. This phrase underscores the importance of adhering to God's statutes as a demonstration of loyalty and love. The call to obedience is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping His commandments as a sign of love (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>but continue to walk in hostility toward Me</b><br>"Walking" in biblical terms often symbolizes one's way of life or conduct. To "walk in hostility" indicates a deliberate and ongoing rebellion against God. This hostility is not merely passive disobedience but an active opposition to God's will. The Israelites' history is marked by periods of such hostility, leading to consequences like exile. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Christ by many, as He was met with hostility despite His message of reconciliation. The call to repentance and reconciliation is a consistent theme throughout Scripture, urging believers to turn from hostility to fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, addressing the Israelites with warnings and consequences for disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the message, God's chosen people who are being warned about the consequences of their actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the laws and commandments to Moses, including the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who conveyed God's laws and messages to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which includes blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God takes disobedience seriously, and persistent rebellion leads to severe consequences.

Each step is corrective, not vindictive; the Lord keeps turning up the volume so the covenant people will finally hear and return. &#8220;Again and again the LORD&#8230; sent word to them through His messengers&#8230; but they mocked God&#8217;s messengers&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). Jeremiah echoes, &#8220;You struck them, but they felt no pain&#8230; they refused correction&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>). Amos records five separate disasters ending with the refrain, &#8220;yet you have not returned to Me&#8221; (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>). By saying &#8220;in spite of all this,&#8221; God is stressing that even His most patient, escalating discipline can be ignored by a hardened heart&#8212;something <a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a> still warns believers about today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you do not obey Me</b><p>Obedience is the covenant&#8217;s hinge. &#8220;If you do not obey the LORD your God, all these curses will come upon you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>). Samuel told Saul, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). Jesus applies the same principle: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). James presses it further: &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). In Leviticus, refusal to obey is not a minor slip but a deliberate breach of an agreed covenant. For the New-Covenant believer, obedience still matters&#8212;not to earn salvation, but to demonstrate faith that is alive (<a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but continue to walk in hostility toward Me</b><p>&#8220;Walk&#8221; describes a settled lifestyle; &#8220;hostility&#8221; (v. 27; cp. v. 21, 23) means active resistance, not mere indifference. Isaiah laments, &#8220;They rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>). Paul explains the heart behind it: &#8220;The mind of the flesh is hostile toward God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>), and apart from Christ we were &#8220;alienated and hostile in mind&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>). Persisting in such a walk moves a person from disobedience to outright enmity, inviting the intensified judgment spelled out in the next verses (vv. 28-33). The text therefore exposes the peril of rehearsed rebellion&#8212;day-by-day choices that cultivate a posture directly opposed to God&#8217;s rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27</a> exposes the frightening possibility that, even after repeated divine warnings and corrective hardships, a person&#8212;or a nation&#8212;can still harden into habitual, hostile disobedience. The verse calls God&#8217;s people to hear early, repent quickly, and obey completely, lest mercy&#8217;s invitations give way to judgment&#8217;s necessity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And if he will not for all this hearken unto me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And if, notwithstanding these, ye will not hearken unto me, </span>that is, if in spite of these awful punishments they persist in rebellion against God.
