It consisted of fine flour, oil, and frankincense. The offering symbolized the fruits of human labor and the dedication of one's sustenance to God. The "remainder" refers to what is left after a portion is burned on the altar as a memorial portion to the LORD.<p><b>shall belong to Aaron and his sons;</b><br>Aaron and his sons, the priests, were set apart to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple. This provision ensured their sustenance, as they did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel. The priests' portion of the offerings was a practical means of support, allowing them to focus on their spiritual duties. This system underscores the principle of providing for those who minister in spiritual matters, a concept echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>it is a most holy part</b><br>The designation "most holy" indicates the highest level of sanctity. Items or offerings deemed "most holy" were to be treated with the utmost reverence and were restricted in their use. Only the priests could consume this portion, and it had to be eaten in a holy place. This reflects the sacredness of the offerings and the seriousness of approaching God&#8217;s holiness.<p><b>of the food offerings</b><br>The term "food offerings" encompasses various sacrifices made to God, including burnt offerings, peace offerings, and sin offerings. These offerings were integral to the worship and covenant relationship between God and Israel. They served as a means of atonement, thanksgiving, and fellowship with God. The grain offering, as part of the food offerings, highlighted the importance of dedicating everyday sustenance to God.<p><b>to the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "to the LORD" emphasizes that the offerings were ultimately directed to God, acknowledging His sovereignty and provision. The offerings were not merely ritualistic but were acts of worship and devotion. This reflects the broader biblical theme of offering one's best to God, as seen in the sacrifices of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>) and the call to present our bodies as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The grain offering, like all offerings, pointed to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
