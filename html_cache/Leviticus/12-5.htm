Some scholars suggest it may relate to the future potential for menstruation and childbirth in the daughter, symbolically extending the period of ritual impurity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of purity and holiness in the community.<p><b>the woman will be unclean for two weeks</b><br>The period of uncleanness for a daughter is double that of a son, which is one week. This reflects the Levitical emphasis on ritual purity and the symbolic nature of uncleanness. The concept of uncleanness is not moral but ceremonial, indicating a temporary state that requires purification. This period allowed the mother to rest and recover, highlighting the care for maternal health in the law.<p><b>as she is during her menstruation</b><br>This comparison to menstruation underscores the natural and cyclical nature of the impurity, which is not sinful but part of the created order. <a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-24</a> provides further context on the laws regarding menstruation, emphasizing the need for separation and purification. This reflects the broader biblical theme of distinguishing between the holy and the common.<p><b>Then she must continue in purification from her bleeding for sixty-six days</b><br>The extended period of purification, totaling eighty days for a daughter, includes both the initial two weeks of uncleanness and the subsequent sixty-six days. This time allowed for the complete healing and restoration of the mother. The number eighty may symbolize completeness or fullness, as seen in other biblical contexts. This purification process prefigures the ultimate purification from sin through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers spiritual cleansing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, forming the community of God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/childbirth.htm">Childbirth</a></b><br>- The event that triggers the period of uncleanness and purification described in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter.htm">Daughter</a></b><br>- The gender of the child born, which affects the duration of the mother's purification period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The place where the Israelites would bring offerings and where the laws of purification would be observed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws of purification highlight the importance of ritual purity in maintaining a relationship with God.

The doubled lengths heighten the sense of completion and mirror other periods of forty in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>), emphasizing thorough preparation before approaching God.<p>&#8226; After this, she would bring the prescribed offerings (<a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm">Leviticus 12:6-8</a>), teaching that cleansing ultimately rests on substitutionary sacrifice&#8212;fulfilled perfectly in Christ, &#8220;who offered Himself without blemish to God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/12-5.htm">Leviticus 12:5</a> sets an eighty-day ritual timetable for a mother after birthing a daughter: fourteen days of ceremonial uncleanness followed by sixty-six days of purification. These divinely appointed periods protected the sanctity of worship, honored God&#8217;s holiness, and pointed forward to the complete cleansing available through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">But if she bear a maid child.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">but if she giveth birth to a female child. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.">Leviticus 12:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">As in her separation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as in the time of her monthly courses. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.">Leviticus 12:2</a>.) In the case of a daughter the days of purification in both stages is exactly double that prescribed at the birth of a son. The reason for this difference is probably owing to the fact that the ancients believed that the physical derangement of the system is far greater at the birth of a girl than at the birth of a boy, and that it requires a longer time for the effects to pass away. Similar laws obtained among other nations of antiquity, and exist to this day among many Eastern tribes. The Greeks held that the man who had been near a woman in childbirth defiled the altar if he approached it. One of the means adopted during the Peloponnesian war for purifying the island of Delos was to proscribe women keeping their confinement on the island. The Hindoos go so far as to regard all the relations of a new-born child as impure; the father has to undergo lustrations, and the mother remains unclean till the tenth day, when the child receives its name. Among the Arabs the mother continues unclean for forty days.<p><span class= "bld">In the blood of her purifying.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in the blood of purification, </span>that is, <span class= "ital">pure blood. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/12-4.htm" title="And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.">Leviticus 12:4</a>.) It will be seen that the law here only legislates for ordinary cases, and that it passes over in silence cases of twins. The administrators of the law during the second Temple had therefore, in this instance, as in many other points, to supplement the Mosaic legislation. They therefore enacted that when a mother had twins, and if they were a boy and a girl, the two stages of her uncleanness were those for a girl. If one of the twins was a boy and the other sexless, or bi-sexual, she continued unclean for both male and female. If, on the contrary, one was a female and the other of neither sex, or bi-sexual, her separation was only for a female.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks;... and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.</span> The reason why the duration of the mother's uncleanness is twice as long at a girl's birth as at a boy's, would appear to be that the uncleanness attached to the child as well as to the mother, but as the boy was placed in a state of ceremonial purity at once by the act of circumcision, which took place on the eighth day, he thereupon ceased to be unclean, and the mother's uncleanness alone remained; whereas in the case of a girl, both mother and child were unclean during the period that the former was "in the blood of her purifying," and therefore that period had to be doubly long. See <a href="/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>, where the right reading is, "When the days of <span class="accented">their</span> purification, according to the Law of Moses, were accomplished." For eight days the infant Saviour submitted to legal uncleanness in "fulfilling all righteousness" (<a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>), and therefore the whole forty days were spoken of as "the days of their purification." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">if, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
