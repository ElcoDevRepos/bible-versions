In ancient Israel, bodily discharges were considered sources of impurity, which could be both natural and pathological. The discharge mentioned here likely refers to a chronic condition, possibly a disease, that causes bodily fluids to be emitted. This law emphasizes the importance of maintaining community health and ritual cleanliness. The concept of impurity is not necessarily moral but rather ceremonial, affecting one's ability to participate in worship and community life. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation between the holy and the common.<p><b>must wash his clothes and bathe with water</b><br>Washing clothes and bathing were practical measures to prevent the spread of disease and maintain hygiene. In the ancient Near East, water was a symbol of purification and renewal. This requirement underscores the importance of physical cleanliness as a reflection of spiritual purity. The act of washing is a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on spiritual cleansing through baptism, symbolizing the washing away of sin and the renewal of the believer.<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>The designation of being "unclean until evening" indicates a temporary state of impurity. This period allowed for the natural cycle of the day to pass, symbolizing a transition from impurity to purity. Evening marked the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, signifying a fresh start. This temporary uncleanness highlights the grace and provision of God, allowing for restoration and reintegration into the community. It also foreshadows the ultimate cleansing and restoration offered through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and provides eternal purification for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_discharge.htm">The Man with the Discharge</a></b><br>This refers to an individual experiencing a bodily discharge, which, according to Levitical law, rendered him ceremonially unclean.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_person_who_touches.htm">The Person Who Touches</a></b><br>Anyone who comes into contact with the man with the discharge becomes unclean and must follow specific purification rituals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/ceremonial_cleansing.htm">Ceremonial Cleansing</a></b><br>The process of washing clothes and bathing with water as a means to restore ceremonial cleanliness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_until_evening.htm">Unclean Until Evening</a></b><br>The period during which the person remains ceremonially unclean, emphasizing the temporary nature of this state.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_community.htm">The Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context involves the community of Israel, which is called to maintain holiness and purity as a reflection of God's nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus emphasize the importance of holiness and separation from impurity.

God&#8217;s concern reaches beyond the individual suffering the discharge to anyone who comes into contact with him. This reinforces that holiness is communal, not merely personal. Touch was the usual way people expressed friendship, offered help, or carried one another&#8217;s burdens. Here the Lord reminds His people that even ordinary acts have spiritual implications. Cross references underline the principle: when one person&#8217;s state of uncleanness could affect another, care must be taken (<a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The body of the man with a discharge</b><p>A &#8220;discharge&#8221; describes an involuntary bodily flow (<a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2-3</a>), likely chronic or contagious. By singling out &#8220;the body,&#8221; God identifies the source of impurity as something physical, not moral disgrace, yet still spiritually significant. The discharge reminds Israel that the fall affected even their bodies (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16-19</a>; <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-23</a>). It also foreshadows Jesus&#8217; ministry, where He touched the ceremonially unclean and made them whole (<a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-42</a>; <a href="/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43-48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must wash his clothes</b><p>Clothing represented one&#8217;s public presence. Washing garments symbolized removing the impurity that could cling to community life. This outward act taught Israel the importance of inward purity (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). The command anticipates New-Covenant imagery: believers are &#8220;clothed&#8221; with Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>) and called to &#8220;keep their garments&#8221; undefiled (<a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bathe with water</b><p>Personal bathing underscores that holiness is not delegated; each individual responds to God&#8217;s standard. Water, the simplest cleansing agent, points ahead to baptism and spiritual washing (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). The process was immediate and accessible&#8212;no elaborate ritual, just obedience in faith. God made holiness practical for every Israelite household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will be unclean until evening</b><p>The uncleanness lasted only until sundown, when a new day ceremonially began. This gracious limit prevented permanent exclusion while still preserving the camp&#8217;s purity (<a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7</a>). Evening anticipates rest; uncleanness does not have the final say. Likewise, Christ&#8217;s atoning work moves believers from darkness to light (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-7.htm">Leviticus 15:7</a> teaches that contact with impurity matters to God, that holiness is practiced through simple, faithful obedience, and that uncleanness, though serious, is temporary when met with God-appointed cleansing. The verse ultimately whispers of Jesus, who removes our deeper defilement and welcomes us into lasting fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And he that toucheth the flesh.</span>--With such intense loathing was the person regarded who had contracted this infirmity, that even the medical man who had professionally to examine him became defiled for the rest of the day.
