In ancient Israel, maintaining purity was crucial for worship and community life. The pot, likely made of clay, would absorb impurities, making anything it touched unclean. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a>, which calls for the people to be clean. The idea of contamination through contact is a metaphor for sin's pervasive nature, which is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the need for inner purity (<a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>).<p><b>and any drink in such a container will be unclean</b><br>The focus here is on the transmission of impurity through liquids, which were common in daily life. This law would have practical implications for the Israelites, ensuring that they remained ceremonially clean. The concept of uncleanness extends beyond physical contamination to spiritual and moral dimensions, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>, which urges believers to cleanse themselves from defilement. This also prefigures the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice, which purifies believers from sin, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>.

Verse 34 follows instructions about an earthen pot that has become defiled by a dead, unclean creature (<a href="/leviticus/11-33.htm">Leviticus 11:33</a>). Just as unclean animals were not to be eaten (<a href="/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4-8</a>), so anything touching a defiled vessel was to be treated as unclean. This flows directly into verses 35-38, where household items, ovens, and water sources are likewise addressed. The pattern underscores the seriousness of holiness (<a href="/leviticus/20-25.htm">Leviticus 20:25-26</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Principle of Ritual Contagion</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Any food coming into contact with water from that pot will be unclean&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-34.htm">Leviticus 11:34</a>).<p>&#8211; Impurity transfers: if the vessel is unclean, whatever it influences also becomes unclean. <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a> shows the same one-way movement&#8212;holiness is not transmitted by touch, but defilement is. <a href="/leviticus/6-27.htm">Leviticus 6:27</a> and <a href="/leviticus/15-12.htm">Leviticus 15:12</a> echo the precedent: contact spreads contamination.<p>&#8211; This teaches Israel that sin pollutes; proximity alone can defile (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why Water and Food Become Unclean</b><p>The earthen pot is porous, permanently affected by what entered it (<a href="/leviticus/11-33.htm">Leviticus 11:33</a>).

According, however, to the canons which obtained during the second Temple, the import of the first part of this verse is that things which constitute man's meat, only then become defiled by the carcase in question when any water whatsoever has been poured upon them, though these articles of food have afterwards become dry; but when they have not been moistened they do not become defiled. By water these authorities understand any of the following seven liquids :--water, dew, oil, wine, milk, blood, and honey.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
