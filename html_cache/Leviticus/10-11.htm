The priests were responsible for instructing the people in the ways of God, ensuring that they understood His laws and commandments. This teaching role is foundational in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people. The importance of teaching is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children diligently. The role of teaching is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus is often referred to as "Rabbi," meaning teacher, highlighting the continuity of this role in God's plan.<p><b>all the statutes</b><br>The term "statutes" refers to the specific laws and decrees given by God to the Israelites. These statutes covered various aspects of life, including moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. The comprehensive nature of these statutes underscores the holiness and order that God desired for His people. In <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-8</a>, the statutes of the Lord are described as trustworthy and right, bringing joy to the heart. The statutes were not merely rules but were intended to guide the Israelites in living a life that reflected God's character and holiness.<p><b>that the LORD has given them</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine origin of the statutes. They were not man-made but were given by the LORD, the covenant name of God, signifying His authority and relationship with Israel. The giving of the law is a central theme in the Old Testament, with Mount Sinai being a pivotal moment where God delivered the Ten Commandments and other laws to Moses. This divine origin is crucial, as it establishes the authority and sacredness of the law, distinguishing it from other ancient legal codes.<p><b>through Moses</b><br>Moses is the mediator through whom God delivered His laws to the Israelites. His role as a prophet and leader is central to the narrative of the Exodus and the establishment of Israel as a nation. Moses' unique relationship with God is highlighted in passages like <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>, where God speaks to Moses face to face. Moses is a type of Christ, as both serve as mediators between God and His people. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets, bringing a new covenant through His life, death, and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egypt and to whom God gave the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, responsible for the priestly duties and teaching the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab_and_abihu.htm">Nadab and Abihu</a></b><br>Sons of Aaron who offered unauthorized fire before the Lord and were consumed by fire as a result.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were to be taught the statutes and laws given by God through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the priests performed their duties and where the law was taught.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_teaching_god's_word.htm">The Importance of Teaching God's Word</a></b><br>Teaching God's statutes is a divine mandate, crucial for guiding the community in righteousness and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">The Role of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders, like the priests, have a responsibility to faithfully communicate God's laws and principles to the people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The account of Nadab and Abihu serves as a warning about the seriousness of adhering to God's commands and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_continuity_of_god's_teaching_mandate.htm">The Continuity of God's Teaching Mandate</a></b><br>From the Old Testament priests to New Testament believers, the call to teach and uphold God's Word remains consistent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_a_royal_priesthood.htm">Living as a Royal Priesthood</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live out and teach God's truths, reflecting His holiness in our daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_10_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 10:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_10_11_s_teaching_relevance.htm">How does Leviticus 10:11 emphasize the importance of teaching God's statutes today?
