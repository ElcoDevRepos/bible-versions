The prohibition against such unions is rooted in the broader Levitical code that seeks to maintain the sanctity and purity of family relationships. This commandment reflects the cultural and religious emphasis on maintaining clear boundaries within familial structures, which were essential for the social and spiritual health of the community. The act of marrying both a woman and her mother would have been seen as a violation of the natural order established by God.<p><b>it is depraved.</b><br>The term "depraved" indicates a moral corruption or perversion. In the context of Leviticus, this word underscores the severity of the offense in the eyes of God. The use of such strong language highlights the importance of adhering to God's commandments and the consequences of deviating from them. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God's people are called to be set apart and to live according to His statutes.<p><b>Both he and they must be burned in the fire,</b><br>The prescribed punishment of being "burned in the fire" signifies the gravity of the sin and serves as a deterrent to others. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such severe penalties were not uncommon for serious offenses. This punishment also reflects the principle of purging evil from the community, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The act of burning may symbolize the complete eradication of sin, ensuring that the community remains pure and undefiled.<p><b>so that there will be no depravity among you.</b><br>This concluding phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of the law. The goal is to prevent the spread of moral corruption within the Israelite community. By enforcing strict penalties, the law aims to uphold the holiness and integrity of God's people. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to His laws is paramount. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for His people to be a holy nation, distinct from the surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given to set them apart as holy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people practicing detestable customs that God wanted His people to avoid.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy and distinct from the surrounding nations.

Crossing generational lines within the same family blurs those boundaries and corrupts the picture of covenant fidelity.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;depraved&#8221; underscores moral perversion, showing that such a relationship is not a minor misstep but a direct assault on God&#8217;s design.<p>&#8226; By naming the sin, God protects vulnerable family members from exploitation (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, where Paul condemns a similar incestuous situation).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is depraved</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Depraved&#8221; conveys extreme moral corruption (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28-32</a>).<p>&#8226; This warning served as a fence around Israel&#8217;s holiness; the same principle applies today as believers are called to flee sexual immorality (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The seriousness of the label confronts any attempt to normalize such unions in culture, reminding us that God, not society, defines purity (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both he and they must be burned in the fire</b><p>&#8220;Both he and they must be burned in the fire.&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>b)<p>&#8226; The prescribed penalty was capital punishment, underscoring the gravity of the sin (compare <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; 21:9).<p>&#8226; Fire symbolized complete removal of evil from the community (<a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Under the New Covenant, Christ has borne the penalty for sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>), yet the church still practices disciplinary separation to preserve holiness (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5, 13</a>).<p>&#8226; This verse reminds us that God&#8217;s justice is uncompromising, while His mercy in Christ is equally real (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that there will be no depravity among you</b><p>&#8226; The ultimate goal is communal purity&#8212;&#8220;so that there will be no depravity among you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Israel was called to be distinct from surrounding nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing the offense kept sin from spreading like leaven (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Today, believers heed the same principle by upholding biblical standards and restoring the fallen through repentance and accountability (<a href="/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19-20</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a> confronts an incestuous union, labels it &#8220;depraved,&#8221; assigns a severe penalty, and explains the purpose: preserving covenant holiness. While Christ&#8217;s atoning work removes the need for civil execution within the church, the passage still warns us to honor God&#8217;s design for family, uphold moral boundaries, and guard the community of faith from corruption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">A wife and her mother.</span>--See <a href="/leviticus/18-17.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shall you take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.">Leviticus 18:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">They shall be burnt with fire.</span>--This, as we have seen, is the second of the four modes of capital punishment. (See <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>.) In the following ten cases those guilty of the sins specified suffered this punishment: (1) the unchaste high priest's daughter (<a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm" title="And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.">Leviticus 21:9</a>); (2) he who had commerce with his daughter; (3)or with his daughter's daughter; (4) or with his son's daughter; (5) or with his wife's daughter; (6) or with her daughter's daughter; (7) or with her son's daughter; (8) or with his mother-in-law; (9) or with the mother of his mother-in-law; and (10), or with the mother of his father-in-law. It will thus be seen that with the exception of the high priest's daughter this death was only inflicted for incest. As the Bible nowhere states the precise mode in which this kind of death is to be carried out, the authorities during the second Temple maintained that it must be executed in such a manner as to leave the body externally un changed by the flames, because, when God himself inflicted this punishment, the dead bodies of Nadab and Abihu were in a perfect state of preservation. (See <a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm" title="And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.">Leviticus 10:2</a>.) To effect this the criminal was put into dung up to his knees, a soft cloth containing a hard one was then tied around his throat, while the two witnesses who had secured his sentence drew tighter by the two cords till the criminal opened his mouth, when molten lead was poured down his throat, thus burning him to death. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version renders it here, "they shall be burnt with fire, with melted lead in their mouth."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
