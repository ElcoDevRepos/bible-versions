In the ancient Near Eastern context, foreigners often had limited rights and were vulnerable to exploitation. By instructing the Israelites to treat foreigners as native-born, God is establishing a standard of fairness and compassion. This reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), highlighting the call to love beyond ethnic and cultural boundaries.<p><b>and love him as yourself</b><br>This phrase underscores the commandment to love others, which is central to both the Old and New Testaments. It parallels the command found in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, "Love your neighbor as yourself," which Jesus cites as the second greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). The call to love the foreigner as oneself challenges believers to extend empathy and kindness, recognizing the shared humanity and dignity of all people. This anticipates the inclusive nature of the Gospel, where all are invited into the family of God regardless of their background (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt</b><br>This reminder of Israel's history serves as a powerful motivator for compassion. The Israelites' experience as foreigners in Egypt, where they faced oppression and hardship, is meant to cultivate empathy and a sense of solidarity with those who are now in similar positions. This historical context is crucial, as it connects the command to love foreigners with Israel's own narrative of redemption and deliverance. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of believers as "aliens and strangers" in the world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>), emphasizing the transient nature of earthly life and the call to live with an eternal perspective.<p><b>I am the LORD your God</b><br>This declaration serves as the divine authority behind the command. It reminds the Israelites of their covenant relationship with God, who is holy and just. The phrase "I am the LORD your God" appears frequently in Leviticus, reinforcing the idea that God's laws are rooted in His character and His relationship with His people. It calls believers to obedience not out of mere duty, but as a response to God's identity and His gracious acts. This echoes the New Testament teaching that love and obedience are intertwined, as seen in Jesus' words, "If you love me, keep my commands" (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners (Gerim)</a></b><br>Refers to non-Israelites residing among the Israelites.

This is not a suggestion but a covenant expectation, echoing <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a> where the Lord says, &#8220;You must not mistreat or oppress a foreigner.&#8221;<p>- The phrase &#8220;as native-born&#8221; removes loopholes. Foreigners were to enjoy the same protections and opportunities as Israelites, just as <a href="/numbers/15-15.htm">Numbers 15:15</a> stipulates, &#8220;The assembly is to have the same statute for you and for the foreigner residing with you.&#8221;<p>- By instituting equal treatment, God models His own impartiality (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>) and safeguards community holiness (<a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>), proving that righteousness reaches beyond ethnic lines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and love him as yourself</b><p>- This repeats the earlier standard of <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, extending the great commandment to every neighbor, including the immigrant. Jesus later fuses these two commands in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>, confirming their enduring authority.<p>- Loving &#8220;as yourself&#8221; means:<p>&#8226; Providing material support when needed (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Defending legal rights (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Welcoming into fellowship and worship (<a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>).<p>- The call is active, not sentimental, mirroring the Samaritan&#8217;s compassion in <a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-37</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt</b><p>- Memory fuels mercy. <a href="/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a> reminds Israel, &#8220;You yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.&#8221; Personal history becomes moral leverage; having tasted oppression, they must not replicate it.<p>- God embeds humility in national identity, preventing ethnocentric pride (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>).<p>- This backward glance also reassures: the same God who delivered them will care for today&#8217;s sojourner (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am the LORD your God</b><p>- The command rests on God&#8217;s character. He alone sets the standard and possesses authority to enforce it, just as He punctuates other holiness laws (<a href="/leviticus/20-7.htm">Leviticus 20:7-8</a>).<p>- &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH) recalls covenant faithfulness first revealed in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, guaranteeing that obedience is never pointless but aligned with a real, present, personal God.<p>- By linking ethical duty to His name, the Lord makes hospitality an act of worship (<a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1-2</a>) and disobedience a personal affront (<a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> binds God&#8217;s people to treat immigrants with the same rights, care, and affection they grant themselves, rooting this ethic in their own redemption story and in the holy, unchanging character of the Lord. What was true for Israel remains a timeless standard: God&#8217;s covenant people must reflect His impartial love in practical, tangible ways toward every outsider.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34)<span class= "bld">But the stranger that dwelleth.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">The stranger that sojourneth. </span>The word "but" is not in the original, and its insertion mars the flow of the passage, whilst the expression rendered in the Authorised Version by "dwelleth" is the same which is translated "sojourn in the preceding verse. This stranger is in every respect to be treated as any other member of the commonwealth, and as a native.<p><span class= "bld">Shalt love him as thyself.</span>--He is not simply to be treated with consideration and courtesy because he is a foreigner, and enjoy the rights and receive the justice due to every human being, but he is to be put on a perfect equality with the ordinary Israelite. Hence the precept laid down in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm" title="You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:18</a>, "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself," is here enacted with regard to the stranger. It was this humane law which attracted so many strangers to Palestine. Hence we find that in the days of Solomon there were 153,600 strangers in the Holy Land.<p><span class= "bld">For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.--</span>To enforce these kindly sentiments towards strangers, which was so contrary to the practice of the surrounding nations, who had an inveterate hatred of all foreigners, the lawgiver appeals to their own bitter experience. They knew with what inhumanity they were treated in Egypt because they were strangers, how they had been humiliated and reduced to slavery. The very thought of this will not only soften their hearts, but will enable them to see that the safety of all classes consists in basing our legislation upon the principle of equal rights to all inhabitants. This pathetic appeal is to be found three times more in the Pentateuch to enforce this precept (<a href="/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-9.htm" title="Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 23:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-19.htm" title="Love you therefore the stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/19-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must treat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the foreigner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;
