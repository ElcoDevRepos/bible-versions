In the context of ancient Israel, setting apart something to the LORD was a serious vow, reflecting the understanding that God is the ultimate owner of all things. This act of dedication is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Nazarite vow (Numbers 6) and the dedication of the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). It underscores the principle of stewardship, where individuals recognize that their possessions are ultimately God's.<p><b>whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land&#8212;</b><br>The inclusion of a man, an animal, or inherited land highlights the comprehensive nature of what could be dedicated to God. In ancient Israel, people, animals, and land were considered valuable assets. Dedicating a person could refer to a lifelong service to God, similar to Samuel's dedication by his mother Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>). Animals were often used in sacrifices, and land was a critical resource for sustenance and inheritance. This reflects the cultural and economic context of the time, where land inheritance was crucial for maintaining family lineage and stability (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7-9</a>).<p><b>can be sold or redeemed;</b><br>Once something was devoted to God, it could not be reclaimed or exchanged. This irrevocability signifies the seriousness of the vow and the sanctity of what is dedicated to God. The concept of redemption, where something could be bought back, was common in other contexts (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-28</a>), but not for items devoted to God. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as being bought with a price and belonging to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>).<p><b>everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD.</b><br>The term "most holy" indicates the highest level of sanctity. In the tabernacle and temple, certain items and areas were designated as "most holy," reserved exclusively for God's use (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33-34</a>). This phrase underscores the idea that what is devoted to God is set apart from common use and is to be treated with the utmost reverence. It reflects the holiness of God and the call for His people to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This concept finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the most holy and who consecrates believers through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the instructions on vows and dedications to the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, to whom the dedications and vows are made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where dedicated items would be brought.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_devotion.htm">Understanding Devotion</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "devoted" (cherem) implies something set apart for destruction or sacred use.

Verse 28 zeroes in on a special class of gifts&#8212;things &#8220;set apart to the LORD.&#8221; Earlier verses allowed most vowed items to be redeemed by paying an added fifth (<a href="/leviticus/27-13.htm">Leviticus 27:13, 15, 19</a>). Here the tone changes. This is about absolute, irrevocable consecration, similar to the &#8220;ban&#8221; imposed on Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-19</a>) and Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3, 21</a>). The principle: once a person voluntarily hands something over under this category, it belongs exclusively to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nothing that a man sets apart to the LORD from all he owns</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Nothing&#8221; leaves no loopholes; every item placed under this vow is covered.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sets apart&#8221; speaks of a deliberate act of devotion, not coercion (compare <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21, 29</a> where offerings were &#8220;willing&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The verse stresses ownership. A man cannot consecrate what he doesn&#8217;t legitimately possess (see <a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a> for David refusing to offer what cost him nothing).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land</b><p>&#8226; People: One might dedicate a household servant or even himself, paralleling Hannah&#8217;s vow of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11, 28</a>).<p>&#8226; Animals: Clean animals were sacrificed; unclean ones could be sold for temple funds (<a href="/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15-17</a>), but not if they fell under this special vow.<p>&#8226; Land: Since land allotments were God-given (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>), setting one&#8217;s inheritance apart underscored total trust in God&#8217;s provision, echoing Abraham&#8217;s willingness to relinquish Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2, 12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can be sold or redeemed</b><p>&#8226; Normally, redemption safeguarded families from permanent loss (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). Here, God overrides that protection&#8212;His claim is absolute.<p>&#8226; Selling would transfer possession; redeeming would buy it back. Both are blocked because the devoted thing has moved into a different category&#8212;God&#8217;s sole property (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-4</a> shows the danger of pretending otherwise).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Most holy&#8221; (compare <a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>) means reserved for divine use alone.<p>&#8226; Once in this sphere, the object is treated like sacrificial blood or the altar&#8217;s fire&#8212;untouchable for common purposes (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a> warns against profaning what God deems sacred).<p>&#8226; The verse safeguards God&#8217;s honor and teaches Israel that generosity toward Him is not a reversible transaction (<a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a> contrasts genuine devotion with deceptive offerings).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why this mattered for Israel</b><p>&#8226; It curbed rash promises; one had to count the cost before speaking (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; It financed temple worship and priestly needs without manipulative bargaining (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; It fostered reverence: God is not a negotiable partner but the sovereign King (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Looking ahead through Scripture</b><p>&#8226; Jesus commends wholehearted giving, praising the widow&#8217;s two coins (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers are urged to present their bodies &#8220;a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), echoing the irrevocable devotion principle.<p>&#8226; Ananias and Sapphira&#8217;s judgment shows that God still takes vowed gifts seriously (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a> teaches that when something is voluntarily placed under a special vow of devotion, it becomes God&#8217;s permanent possession.

By labeling these gifts &#8220;most holy,&#8221; the Lord underscores His absolute ownership and calls His people to thoughtful, wholehearted dedication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Notwithstanding no devoted thing.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Nevertheless, no banned thing </span>(see <a href="/leviticus/27-26.htm" title="Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.">Leviticus 27:26</a>), that is, unlike those things consecrated to God by the vow hitherto spoken of, anything which the vower devoted to God under a solemn ban cannot be redeemed.<span class= "bld"><p>Both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession.</span>--This shows the extent to which a man may go in exercising his power to devote things to God in this manner.

Such persons, instead of being tried and condemned, might be at once devoted and put to death" (Gardiner). "To this it may be added that the devotion by ban (<span class="accented">cherem</span>) of any object or person was not to be done by private persons, at their own will, but was performed by the civil magistrates, under known conditions and laws; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the cities of idolaters, such as Jericho, were so devoted, and the inhabitants, by the command of God himself, who made his people to be the executioners of his judgments against inveterate idolatry (see <a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>;
