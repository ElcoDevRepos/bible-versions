The bull was a sin offering, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity. The hide, flesh, and dung represent the entirety of the animal, emphasizing the completeness of the sacrifice. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the bull was a significant sacrificial animal, often associated with strength and fertility. The complete burning of the bull's remains signifies the total eradication of sin, a concept that foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity in totality.<p><b>he burned outside the camp</b><br>Burning the remains outside the camp was a practice that underscored the removal of impurity from the community. The camp represented the dwelling place of God's people, and anything unclean was to be taken outside to maintain holiness within. This act prefigures the crucifixion of Jesus, who suffered outside the city gates of Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-13</a>), symbolizing the bearing of sin and shame away from the people. The geographical separation highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for purification.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's specific instructions. The detailed commands given to Moses for the consecration of the priests reflect the importance of following divine directives precisely. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, illustrating the relationship between God and His people. The adherence to God's commands in Leviticus is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law through His perfect obedience (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).
