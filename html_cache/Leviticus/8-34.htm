The ceremony involved sacrifices, anointing, and the wearing of sacred garments. This event marked the establishment of the priesthood in Israel, a significant moment in the religious life of the nation. The ordination took place at the Tabernacle, the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey.<p><b>has been commanded by the LORD</b><br>The ordination process was not a human invention but a divine command. This underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. The LORD's commands were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, emphasizing the divine origin and authority of the priesthood. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the necessity of following His will.<p><b>in order to make atonement</b><br>Atonement is a central theme in Leviticus, involving the reconciliation between God and His people. The priesthood was established to mediate this relationship, offering sacrifices to atone for the sins of the Israelites. This foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, the perfect High Priest, who offered Himself as the final sacrifice for sin, as explained in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Hebrews.<p><b>on your behalf</b><br>The priests acted as representatives of the people before God. This mediatory role is crucial in understanding the function of the priesthood. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the mediator between God and humanity, fulfilling and surpassing the role of the Old Testament priests. This highlights the continuity and fulfillment of the Old Testament sacrificial system in the person and work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments.
