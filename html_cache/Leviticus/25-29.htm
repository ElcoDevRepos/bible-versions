Houses within these cities were considered valuable due to their strategic location. The sale of such a house was not just a financial transaction but also involved considerations of family heritage and community ties. The concept of selling property in a walled city reflects the structured society of ancient Israel, where land and property were integral to one's identity and inheritance.<p><b>he retains his right of redemption</b><br>The right of redemption was a provision in the Mosaic Law that allowed the original owner or a close relative to buy back property. This reflects the importance of family and tribal continuity in Israelite society. Redemption laws ensured that property remained within the family, preventing permanent loss of inheritance. This principle is echoed in the story of Ruth and Boaz, where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>until a full year after its sale;</b><br>The one-year period provided a fair opportunity for the original owner to gather the necessary resources to redeem the property. This timeframe underscores the balance between economic transactions and familial rights. It also reflects God's concern for justice and mercy, allowing individuals time to recover from financial hardship.<p><b>during that year it may be redeemed.</b><br>The possibility of redemption during the year emphasizes the temporary nature of the sale. This provision ensured that families could reclaim their ancestral homes, maintaining their connection to the land. The concept of redemption is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing deliverance and restoration. It foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from sin, restoring the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seller.htm">The Seller</a></b><br>The individual who sells a house within a walled city.

These are not the creation of God (see <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm" title="The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.">Leviticus 25:23</a>), allotted by His command to the different tribes of Israel; they are the work of man, who build them up and raze them to the ground at their own will, and according to their fancy. Hence the law of jubile does not apply to these temporary human buildings. Though an Israelite could sell his house without being driven by stress of circumstances to do it, still, as he may feel attached to his home, the Divine law affords him some protection for a limited period, during which he or his family may redeem the building. During the second Temple "a dwelling house in a walled city" was defined to be a house standing within an area of land which was first walled round for the purpose of building upon it human habitations, and in which the houses were afterwards erected. But if the houses were built first, and the city wall afterwards, they do not come within the law here laid down.<p><span class= "bld">Within a full year may he redeem it.</span>--If within a year of the sale he wishes to redeem, the Law gives him the power, or in case he dies empowers his son, to repurchase the property at the same price which he received for it. Besides limiting the period to a year, the Law does not prescribe that the next of kin is to redeem, nor give him the power to do it. During the second Temple it was also enacted that the vendor could not redeem it with borrowed money.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - Houses in walled cities are not subject to the law of restoration at the jubilee, as that law applies only to lands and to men; but houses in the country are subject to the law, as they are regarded only as appurtenances of the land. Houses in cities, being occupied by artisans and built by human industry, not originally assigned in the territorial division, are not considered in so strict a sense the property of the Lord as the soil is, and may be parted with more readily. Yet the owners, if obliged to part with them, are allowed a year's grace, during which they are to have the right of buying them back. The expression, within <span class="cmt_word">a full year</span>, would be more literally rendered <span class="accented">during a fixed time</span>, that fixed time having just before been declared to be a year. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
