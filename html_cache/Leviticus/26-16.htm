It reflects the conditional nature of the Mosaic Covenant, where blessings follow obedience and curses follow disobedience. This concept is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties, where a sovereign would outline blessings for loyalty and curses for rebellion.<p><b>I will bring upon you sudden terror:</b><br>Sudden terror refers to unexpected fear and panic, often seen as a divine judgment. In the biblical context, this can be linked to the fear that overtakes those who are not under God's protection, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-67.htm">Deuteronomy 28:67</a>. It serves as a reminder of the security found in obedience to God.<p><b>wasting disease, and fever that will destroy your sight and drain your life:</b><br>These physical afflictions symbolize the breakdown of health and vitality as a result of sin. Wasting disease and fever were common in the ancient world and often seen as divine punishment.

The idea of enemies consuming the fruits of one's labor is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a> and serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God.

The second of the two, however, which is here translated "burning ague" in the Authorised Version, is, in the Deuteronomy passage, rendered simply by "fever."
