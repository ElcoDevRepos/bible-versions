It symbolizes reconciliation and communion with God, reflecting a state of peace between the offerer and the Lord. This offering is voluntary, expressing gratitude and thanksgiving. It is distinct from sin and guilt offerings, which are mandatory for atonement. The peace offering can be seen as a type of Christ, who is our peace (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), reconciling us to God through His sacrifice.<p><b>he is to bring a food offering to the LORD</b><br>The food offering, or grain offering, is a portion of the peace offering that is presented to God. It signifies the dedication of the offerer's sustenance and life to the Lord. This act of bringing an offering to God is an acknowledgment of His provision and sovereignty. In the New Testament, believers are encouraged to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), dedicating their lives to God in a similar manner.<p><b>the fat that covers the entrails</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, fat was considered the best part of the animal, symbolizing richness and abundance. Offering the fat to God signifies giving Him the best portion, acknowledging His worthiness of the finest offerings. The entrails, or inner parts, represent the innermost being of the animal, and by extension, the offerer. This offering foreshadows Christ's complete and perfect sacrifice, as He gave His all for humanity.<p><b>all the fat that is on them</b><br>The emphasis on offering all the fat underscores the totality of the sacrifice. Nothing is to be held back from God, reflecting the principle of wholehearted devotion. This mirrors the call for believers to love the Lord with all their heart, soul, and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). In the context of Christ's sacrifice, it points to His total obedience and surrender to the Father's will, offering Himself entirely for the redemption of mankind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the recipient of the offerings and the one who establishes the laws and rituals for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for presenting the offering to the LORD, acting as a mediator between God and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peace_offering.htm">The Peace Offering (Zebach Shelamim)</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Levitical system, symbolizing fellowship and communion with God.

Its very name points to harmony after sin had been covered by the earlier burnt or sin offerings (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>). In this verse Moses reminds Israel that the material for the next action&#8212;the fat portion&#8212;comes &#8220;from&#8221; that peace sacrifice. It underlines that peace with God is costly; it flows out of shed blood (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>) and anticipates the greater sacrifice that would reconcile all things to God through Christ&#8217;s cross (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is to bring a food offering to the LORD</b><p>Though the worshiper and his family would eventually share a meal from the peace offering (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>), the choicest part was brought to God first. Scripture consistently emphasizes giving the best, not the leftovers (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>). The phrase &#8220;food offering&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>) signals something pleasing to God&#8217;s &#8220;nostrils,&#8221; pointing ahead to Christ, whose self-giving was &#8220;a fragrant offering&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). Our fellowship with the LORD today still begins with offering ourselves wholly to Him (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the fat that covers the entrails</b><p>Ancient people viewed fat as the richest, most luxurious part of an animal (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). The layer over the inner organs was particularly prized, so surrendering it acknowledged God&#8217;s ownership of the very best. Leviticus later forbids Israel to eat any fat (<a href="/leviticus/7-23.htm">Leviticus 7:23</a>), reserving it solely for His altar. The inward location of this fat also whispers that true worship reaches the innermost parts of life (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>), not merely outward gestures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the fat that is on them</b><p>In case someone might keep a portion back, God asks for &#8220;all&#8221; the fat (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). Complete devotion is the pattern throughout Scripture&#8212;Abraham&#8217;s willingness with Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-12.htm">Genesis 22:12</a>), Elijah&#8217;s call to wholehearted loyalty (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>), and Jesus&#8217; demand to love God with &#8220;all&#8221; heart, soul, mind, and strength (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>). Holding nothing back in sacrifice pictures the believer&#8217;s call to hold nothing back in obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3</a> teaches that peace with God rests on a sacrifice whose choicest, hidden, and entire portion belongs to Him. By giving the richest fat from the peace offering, Israel affirmed that the best comes from the LORD and returns to Him. In Christ, the ultimate peace offering, God has given His best for us; our fitting response is to offer every &#8220;fat&#8221; portion of life back in grateful devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And he shall offer.</span>--That is, he who brings the sacrifices, not the priest.<p><span class= "bld">The fat.</span>--That is, the best or choicest part.
