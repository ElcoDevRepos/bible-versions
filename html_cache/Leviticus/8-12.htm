Anointing oil was a sacred mixture, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>, and its use was reserved for consecrating priests, kings, and sacred objects. The pouring of oil on the head represents the Holy Spirit's empowerment, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the anointing of Jesus (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>) and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>and anointed him</b><br>Anointing Aaron set him apart for his role as high priest, establishing a divine appointment and authority. This act is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The anointing signifies a transfer of God's authority and blessing, marking Aaron as a mediator between God and the Israelites. This prefigures Christ's role as the mediator of a new covenant (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>to consecrate him</b><br>Consecration involves setting someone or something apart for a holy purpose. In the context of Leviticus, it underscores the holiness required of those who serve in God's presence. The consecration of Aaron and his sons (<a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>) is a foreshadowing of the believer's call to holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). It also points to the ultimate consecration found in Jesus, who sanctifies believers through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who performs the anointing ceremony.

This follows the precise pattern God had given earlier (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>) and mirrors later moments when leaders were likewise publicly anointed&#8212;Samuel with Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>) and Elijah with Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). The action is visible, memorable, and teaches that God&#8217;s appointments are unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>some of the anointing oil</b><p>The special oil, described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>, was a unique blend reserved for sacred use. Its fragrance marked the tabernacle furnishings (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>) and now marks the high priest, binding him to everything holy around him. Oil often pictures the Holy Spirit&#8217;s empowering presence (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>), so this moment signals that Aaron&#8217;s ministry can only operate by divine enablement, not human effort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on Aaron&#8217;s head</b><p>The head represents leadership, authority, and the origin of direction for the whole body (<a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>, where the oil flows &#8220;down upon the beard, upon the collar of his robes&#8221;). By beginning at Aaron&#8217;s head, God shows that everything stemming from his office&#8212;teachings, judgments, blessings&#8212;must be saturated with holiness. When Aaron later blesses Israel (<a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>), he does so as one already marked by God&#8217;s sanctifying oil.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and anointed him</b><p>To anoint is to declare, &#8220;This one is chosen, set apart, and equipped.&#8221; Aaron moves from ordinary man to &#8220;the priest&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>). The same verb describes God&#8217;s selection of kings (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>) and, ultimately, His Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). Aaron becomes a living pointer to the greater High Priest, Jesus, who is anointed &#8220;with the oil of gladness&#8221; above His companions (<a href="/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to consecrate him</b><p>Consecration means permanent dedication to God&#8217;s service (<a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10-12</a>). From this day forward Aaron&#8217;s life, garments, and duties belong wholly to the LORD (<a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>). Every sacrifice he offers, every word he speaks, now carries divine authority and responsibility, prefiguring Christ who is &#8220;holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a> shows Moses lavishly pouring the sacred oil on Aaron&#8217;s head, vividly marking him as God&#8217;s chosen high priest. The act links Aaron with the holy objects of the tabernacle, symbolizes the Spirit&#8217;s empowering presence, establishes his authority over Israel, and dedicates him irrevocably to God&#8217;s service&#8212;all foreshadowing the flawless and eternal priesthood fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head.</span>--In the anointing of Aaron, the oil was poured upon his head. (See also <a href="/context/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10-12</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-2.htm" title="It is like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;">Psalm 133:2</a>.) This profuse pouring of oil was repeated at the consecration of every successor to the high-priesthood, whilst the common priests were simply anointed, or were simply marked with the finger on the forehead on their first installation, and this anointing descended with them for all futurity. (See <a href="/leviticus/6-3.htm" title="Or have found that which was lost, and lies concerning it, and swears falsely; in any of all these that a man does, sinning therein:">Leviticus 6:3</a>.) Tradition informs us that during the second Temple, the person who anointed the high priest first threw the oil upon his head, and then drew with his finger the sign of the letter <span class= "ital">Caph, </span>being the initial of <span class= "ital">Cohen, i.e., </span>priest, between the eyebrows of the newly-consecrated pontiff.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head</span>. The change of the verb <span class="accented">poured</span> for <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>, indicates that the amount of "the precious ointment" poured "upon the head, that ran down unto the beard, and went down to the skirts of his garments" (<a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), was far greater than that with which the furniture of the tabernacle had been anointed. The oil sprinkled on the holy things sanctified them as means of grace. The oil poured upon Aaron represents the grace of the Holy Spirit, coming from without, but diffusing itself over and throughout the whole consecrated man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also poured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1465;&#1511;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7779;&#333;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
