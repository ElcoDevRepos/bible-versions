The Book of Leviticus is part of the Pentateuch, traditionally attributed to Moses, and is primarily concerned with laws and regulations for the Israelites. This chapter, in particular, deals with laws regarding sexual conduct, emphasizing holiness and separation from the practices of surrounding nations.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* At this point in Israel's history, the Israelites are in the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. They are being formed into a distinct nation with unique laws and customs. The surrounding nations, such as the Egyptians and Canaanites, practiced various forms of idolatry and immorality, which the Israelites are being instructed to avoid.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* The phrase "the LORD said to Moses" is a common introduction in the Pentateuch, indicating direct communication from God. This is seen throughout Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, underscoring Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people. Similar phrases can be found in <a href="/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2</a> and <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a>, highlighting the continuity of divine revelation.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* Moses serves as a type of Christ, acting as a mediator between God and His people. Just as Moses received the law from God to instruct the Israelites, Jesus is the ultimate mediator of the New Covenant, bringing God's final revelation to humanity (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>).<br><br>*Prophecy:* While this specific phrase is not prophetic, the laws given to Moses often foreshadow the coming of Christ, who fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).

MORAL UNCLEANNESS AND ITS PUNISHMENT. This being the subject of the three following chapters (chapters 18-20), they naturally form a sequence to chapters 11-17, which have dealt with ceremonial uncleanness and its purification. It is a remarkable thing that, except by implication in connection with the sin offerings and the trespass offerings and the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, there has not yet been a single moral precept, as such, in the Book of Leviticus, and there has been very little recognition of sin as distinct from pollution. All has been ceremonial. But the ceremonial is typical of the moral, and from the consideration of ceremonial uncleanness and its remedy, we now proceed to the consideration of moral uncleanness and its penalty. It is to be noticed too that, while the ensuing laws are commanded as the positive injunction of God (verses 2, 30), which of itself is sufficient to give them their authority and force, they are still founded, like the ceremonial prohibitions, upon the feelings of repugnance implanted in the mind of man. To enter into the marriage relation with near relatives is abhorrent to a sentiment in mankind so widely spread that it may be deemed to have been originally universal, and the same abhorrence is entertained towards other foul sins of lust. Ugliness, which creates disgust by its ugliness, symbolizes sin; immorality, which inspires abhorrence by its immoral character, proves itself thereby to be sin. The section deals first with sin in the marriage relation, next with sexual impurities connected with marriage, then with other cases of immorality, and lastly with the penalties inflicted on these sins in their character of crimes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5</span> form an introduction to the Hebrew code of prohibited degrees of marriage and of forbidden sins of lust. The formal and solemn declaration, <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord your God</span>, is made three times in these five verses. This places before the people the two thoughts: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the Lord is holy, and they ought to be like him in holiness; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the Lord has commanded holiness, and they ought to obey him by being holy. Because the Lord is their God, and they are his people, they are, negatively, to refrain from the vicious habits and lax customs prevalent in <span class="cmt_word">the land of Egypt wherein they dwelt</span>, and in the land of Canaan whither they were going, the sensuality of which is indirectly condemned by the injunctions which command purity in contrast to their <span class="cmt_word">doings</span>; and, positively, they are to <span class="cmt_word">keep God's statutes, and his judgments</span>, as laid down in the following code, <span class="cmt_word">which if a man do, he shall live in them</span>. The latter clause is of special importance, because it is repeated in the same connection by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11, 13, 21</a>), and in the Levitical confession in the Book of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>), and is quoted by St. Paul in a controversial sense (<a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>). Its full meaning is that by obedience to God's commands man attains to a state of existence which alone deserves to be called true life - "the life which connects him with Jehovah through his obedience" (Clark). And this involves the further truth that disobedience results in death. Accordingly, St. Paul uses the text as being the testimony of the Law with regard to itself, that salvation by it is of works in contrast with faith. (Cf. <a href="/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>.) We have no evidence to tell us what were <span class="accented">the doings of the land of Canaan</span> in respect to the marriage relation, but this chapter is enough to show that the utmost laxity prevailed in it, and we may be sure that their religious rites, like those of Midian (<a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>), were penetrated with the spirit of licentiousness. With regard to <span class="accented">the doings of the land of Egypt</span>, we have fuller information. We know that among the Egyptians marriage with sisters and half-sisters was not only permissible, but that its propriety was justified by their religious beliefs, and practiced in the royal family (Died. Sic., 1:27; Die. Cass., 42). Other abominations condemned in this chapter (verse 23) also, as we know, existed there (Herod., 2:46), and if queens could be what in later times Cleopatra was, we may imagine the general dissoluteness of the people. Among Persians, Medes, Indians, Ethiopians and Assyrians, marriage with mothers and daughters was allowed, and from the time of Cambyses, marriage with a sister was regarded as lawful (Herod., 3:31). The Athenians and Spartans permitted marriage with half-sisters. All these concessions to lust, and ether unclean acts with which the heathen world was full (verse 22; <a href="/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>), were fallings away from the law of purity implanted in the heart of man and now renewed for the Hebrew people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/leviticus/18-1.htm">OT Law: Leviticus 18:1 Yahweh said to Moses (Le Lv Lev.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/leviticus/17-16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Leviticus 17:16"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 17:16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/leviticus/18-2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Leviticus 18:2"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 18:2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
