The casting of lots was a method used to discern God's will, ensuring that the choice was divinely guided. The term "scapegoat" comes from the Hebrew word "Azazel," which has been interpreted in various ways, including as a reference to a demon or a rugged place. This goat symbolically carried the sins of the people away, illustrating the removal of sin from the community. The concept of a scapegoat is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is seen as the ultimate bearer of sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>).<p><b>shall be presented alive before the LORD</b><br>The living presentation of the goat signifies its role as a living sacrifice, distinct from the goat that was sacrificed. This act of presenting the goat alive underscores the idea of life and death in the atonement process. The living goat stands before the LORD, symbolizing the acknowledgment of sin and the need for divine intervention. This presentation is a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who was presented alive before God and humanity as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>to make atonement</b><br>Atonement in the Old Testament involved covering or cleansing from sin, allowing for reconciliation between God and His people. The Day of Atonement was the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. The scapegoat's role in atonement prefigures Christ's atoning work on the cross, where He made a once-for-all sacrifice for sin (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<p><b>by sending it into the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of desolation and separation, symbolizing the complete removal of sin from the community. This act of sending the goat away illustrates the concept of sin being taken far from the people, never to return. The wilderness is often seen in Scripture as a place of testing and purification, as seen in Israel's wanderings and Jesus' temptation (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>).<p><b>as the scapegoat</b><br>The scapegoat serves as a powerful symbol of substitution and expiation. By bearing the sins of the people, the scapegoat points to the need for a substitute to take on the penalty of sin. This typology is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity and provided a way for reconciliation with God (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). The scapegoat's role highlights the gravity of sin and the profound grace of God in providing a means of atonement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The central figure in the Day of Atonement rituals, responsible for performing the sacrifices and sending the scapegoat into the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scapegoat.htm">The Scapegoat (Azazel)</a></b><br>A goat chosen by lot to symbolically carry the sins of the people into the wilderness, representing the removal of sin from the community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A desolate place where the scapegoat is sent, symbolizing the separation of sin from the people of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine presence before whom the atonement is made, emphasizing the sacredness and seriousness of the ritual.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The community for whom the atonement is made, highlighting the collective nature of sin and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The scapegoat ritual illustrates the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.

One goat would symbolize the people&#8212;laden with guilt&#8212;yet be sent away instead of them. The pattern foreshadows Christ, &#8220;who knew no sin&#8221; yet was &#8220;made&#8230;sin for us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>) and takes our iniquities like the servant of <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>.<p>&#8226; By God&#8217;s design, innocence is chosen to bear guilt. The crowds once demanded the release of Barabbas while Jesus went to the cross (<a href="/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39-40</a>), a tragic historical echo of this ritual exchange.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall be presented alive before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Unlike the first goat, which was slaughtered (<a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm">Leviticus 16:9</a>), this one remained alive and was brought into the holy presence of God. Life was spared so that life might be given back to the nation.<p>&#8226; The living goat reminds us that atonement is not only about death but also about life restored. Jesus, &#8220;alive forevermore,&#8221; appears &#8220;in God&#8217;s presence for us&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Our response mirrors the picture: &#8220;Offer your bodies as living sacrifices&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). Believers stand before God, alive because Another has died.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to make atonement</b><p>&#8226; Atonement means covering, reconciliation, the removal of the barrier of sin.

Both images unite in Christ, who &#8220;entered the Most Holy Place once for all&#8230;having obtained eternal redemption&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;He Himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>).
