The Jubilee occurred every 50 years, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8-12</a>, and was a time when land was to be returned to its original family owners. This ensured that no family would permanently lose their inheritance. The concept of Jubilee reflects God's concern for social justice and economic equality, preventing the accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of a few. It also emphasizes the idea that the land ultimately belongs to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). The Jubilee year is a type of the ultimate redemption and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who proclaimed the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>), symbolizing spiritual freedom and restoration.<p><b>he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years remaining.</b><br>The value of the land was determined by the number of harvests remaining until the next Jubilee. This system ensured fairness in transactions, as the price would decrease as the Jubilee approached. The focus on harvest years highlights the agrarian nature of Israelite society, where the land's productivity was central to economic life. This principle underscores the importance of stewardship and the recognition that the land's ultimate purpose was to provide sustenance. The concept of harvest also carries spiritual significance, as it is often used in Scripture to symbolize the gathering of believers (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>) and the final judgment (<a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>). The regulation of land sales in this manner reflects God's desire for equitable treatment and the prevention of exploitation among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the instructions in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, specifically addressing their economic and social practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event occurring every 50 years in Israel, where land was returned to original owners, and debts were forgiven, symbolizing freedom and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_jubilee.htm">Understanding the Jubilee</a></b><br>The Jubilee year was a time of economic reset, reflecting God's desire for justice and equality among His people.

The plot which should thus come into the possession of each family is to be absolutely inalienable, and for ever continue to be the property of the descendants of the original possessor. Hence it is here enacted that where a proprietor being pressed by poverty is compelled to sell a field, it could not be bought of him for a longer period than up to the time of the next jubile, when it reverted to the original possessor, or to his family. In purchasing a plot of and the purchaser is to reckon how many years had elapsed since the last jubile, since this would show him the exact period during which he would be entitled to hold it. It thus corresponds to what with us is buying the unexpired term of a lease.<p><span class= "bld">Of thy neighbour.</span>--From this it was deduced that the Israelite who was reduced to poverty could only sell his land to a fellow-Israelite, but not to a Gentile.<p><span class= "bld">The number of years of the fruit he shall sell.</span>--Whilst the purchaser is to take into consideration the number of years which the lease has still to run, the vendor has to consider how many sabbatical years there will be from the time of the sale till next jubile, since the sale was not so much of the land as of the produce of so many years.
