Vows were voluntary but binding once made. The act of vowing an animal indicates a personal commitment to God, reflecting the seriousness of one's devotion and the desire to honor God with something of value. This practice is seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in Hannah's vow in <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>.<p><b>that may be brought as an offering to the LORD</b><br>The animal must be one that is acceptable for sacrifice according to the Levitical laws. This typically included animals like bulls, sheep, and goats, which were considered clean and suitable for offerings. The specification underscores the importance of offering only what is deemed pure and acceptable to God, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>. This reflects the holiness and perfection required in worship and sacrifice.<p><b>any such animal given to the LORD</b><br>Once an animal is vowed and given to the LORD, it is set apart for sacred use. This act of giving signifies a transfer of ownership from the individual to God, emphasizing the principle of consecration. The concept of giving to the LORD is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the importance of dedicating one's best to God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>.<p><b>shall be holy</b><br>The term "holy" means set apart or consecrated for a divine purpose. In the context of Leviticus, holiness is a central theme, reflecting God's nature and the call for His people to be distinct from other nations. The animal, once vowed and given, becomes holy, symbolizing the transformation that occurs when something is dedicated to God. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was holy and set apart for the redemption of humanity, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the instructions on vows and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, to whom the offerings and vows are made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where offerings were brought and presented to the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows_and_offerings.htm">Vows and Offerings</a></b><br>The specific context of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, dealing with the dedication of animals to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_offerings.htm">The Holiness of Offerings</a></b><br>When an animal is vowed to the LORD, it becomes holy, set apart for God's purposes.

The verse assumes a voluntary promise to God. A few things stand out:<p>&#8226; Vows are optional, yet binding once spoken (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The worshiper chooses the offering, indicating a personal act of devotion (<a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Such vows often arose from gratitude or a desire for God&#8217;s help (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that may be brought as an offering to the LORD</b><p>Only certain animals qualified:<p>&#8226; They had to be &#8220;clean,&#8221; meeting sacrificial standards laid out earlier (<a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2-3</a>; 11:1-47).<p>&#8226; They needed to be without defect&#8212;no blemishes or deformities (<a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18-24</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores God&#8217;s right to determine what He will accept (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4-5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p>For believers today, this points to giving God what aligns with His revealed will rather than our own preferences (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>any such animal given to the LORD shall be holy</b><p>&#8220;Any such animal given to the LORD will be holy&#8221;.
