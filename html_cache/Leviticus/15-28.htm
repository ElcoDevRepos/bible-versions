In the ancient Israelite context, bodily discharges were considered ritually impure, impacting one's ability to participate in communal worship and daily life. The cleansing process underscores the importance of purity in maintaining a relationship with God. This reflects the broader Levitical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, which is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>she must count off seven days</b><br>The requirement to count seven days signifies a complete period of purification, symbolizing wholeness and completion in biblical numerology. The number seven frequently appears in Scripture, often associated with creation (Genesis 1), rest (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), and divine perfection. This period allows for a transition from impurity to purity, emphasizing the need for intentional preparation before re-entering the community and worship.<p><b>and after that she will be ceremonially clean</b><br>The concept of ceremonial cleanliness is crucial in Levitical law, distinguishing between the sacred and the profane. Once the seven days are completed, the woman is restored to a state of ritual purity, allowing her to participate fully in religious and communal activities. This restoration process can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where believers are cleansed from sin and restored to fellowship with God. The emphasis on ceremonial cleanliness also points to the future fulfillment in Christ, who provides ultimate purification for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse is a woman who has experienced a discharge, likely related to menstruation or another form of bodily discharge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the priest plays a crucial role in the purification process described in Leviticus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where purification rituals and offerings were made, central to the Israelites' worship and community life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_days.htm">The Seven Days</a></b><br>A period of waiting and purification, symbolizing completeness and preparation for re-entry into the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cleansing_process.htm">The Cleansing Process</a></b><br>A ritual process that signifies spiritual and physical purification, allowing the woman to return to normal societal and religious activities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus highlight the importance of purity in approaching God, emphasizing the need for holiness in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_seven_days.htm">Symbolism of Seven Days</a></b><br>The number seven often represents completeness in the Bible, reminding us of the completeness of God's work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_cleansing.htm">Spiritual Cleansing</a></b><br>Just as the woman needed physical cleansing, we need spiritual cleansing through Christ to maintain our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_restoration.htm">Community and Restoration</a></b><br>The purification process allowed individuals to be restored to their community, teaching us the importance of reconciliation and restoration in our relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_fulfillment_of_the_law.htm">Christ's Fulfillment of the Law</a></b><br>Jesus' ministry shows that He fulfills the law's requirements, offering a deeper, spiritual cleansing that the rituals pointed towards.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_15_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 15:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_28_Purification_before_worship.htm">How does Leviticus 15:28 emphasize the importance of purification before worshiping God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Leviticus_15_28_purification.htm">What spiritual lessons can we learn from the purification process in Leviticus 15:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_28_and_NT_purity_links.htm">How does Leviticus 15:28 connect to New Testament teachings on purity and holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Leviticus_15_28_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the principles of Leviticus 15:28 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_28_Purification_s_purpose.htm">How does the purification in Leviticus 15:28 reflect God's desire for a holy people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_28_and_modern_women_s_health.htm">How does Leviticus 15:28 relate to modern views on women's health and purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_cleansing_in_Lev_15_28.htm">Why does Leviticus 15:28 emphasize ritual cleansing after a woman's discharge?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Leviticus_15_28_s_laws.htm">What historical context influenced the laws in Leviticus 15:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_period_sex_acceptable.htm">Is sex during a woman's period acceptable?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_menstruation_impure_in_leviticus.htm">Leviticus 15:19-24 -
