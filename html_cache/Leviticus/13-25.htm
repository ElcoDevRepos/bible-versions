Their role in examining skin conditions was crucial for maintaining the purity and health of the community. This examination process reflects the importance of discernment and careful observation, which is a theme throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>, where believers are encouraged to "test everything."<p><b>If the hair in the spot has turned white</b><br>White hair in a skin spot was a key indicator of a serious skin disease, possibly leprosy. This change in hair color signified a deeper issue beneath the surface, symbolizing how sin can manifest outwardly from an inward condition. This concept is echoed in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>, where Jesus speaks of the Pharisees as "whitewashed tombs," appearing clean outwardly but corrupt within.<p><b>and the spot appears to be deeper than the skin,</b><br>A spot deeper than the skin indicated a more severe condition, suggesting that the disease was not superficial. This depth symbolizes the pervasive nature of sin, which affects the heart and soul, not just outward actions. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> speaks to this, stating, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure."<p><b>it is a disease that has broken out in the burn.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the disease has spread from a burn, showing how existing wounds can become infected. Spiritually, this can be seen as a metaphor for how unresolved issues or sins can lead to greater spiritual problems. <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a> illustrates this progression, where desire gives birth to sin, and sin, when full-grown, leads to death.<p><b>The priest must pronounce him unclean;</b><br>The declaration of uncleanness was significant, as it affected the individual's ability to participate in community and worship. This separation underscores the seriousness of sin and impurity, which separates humanity from God. <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a> states, "Your iniquities have separated you from your God."<p><b>it is a diseased infection.</b><br>The term "diseased infection" highlights the contagious and defiling nature of the condition. In a broader sense, it serves as a reminder of the pervasive and destructive nature of sin, which can spread and corrupt if not addressed. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a> discusses how sin entered the world through one man and spread to all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator and examiner, determining the cleanliness or uncleanliness of individuals based on God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_infected_person.htm">The Infected Person</a></b><br>The individual with a potential skin disease, seeking examination and guidance from the priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burn.htm">The Burn</a></b><br>A physical injury that may become infected, serving as a focal point for determining ritual cleanliness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_examination.htm">The Examination</a></b><br>A process conducted by the priest to discern the nature of the skin condition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pronouncement_of_uncleanliness.htm">The Pronouncement of Uncleanliness</a></b><br>A declaration by the priest that affects the individual's standing within the community and their ability to participate in religious activities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's role as an examiner underscores the importance of spiritual discernment and leadership within the community of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_uncleanliness.htm">Understanding Uncleanliness</a></b><br>Uncleanliness in Leviticus is not merely physical but has spiritual implications, reminding us of the pervasive nature of sin and the need for purification.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community.htm">The Importance of Community</a></b><br>The process of examination and pronouncement affects the individual's relationship with the community, highlighting the interconnectedness of personal and communal holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_examination.htm">Spiritual Examination</a></b><br>Just as the priest examines physical conditions, believers are called to examine their hearts and lives for spiritual impurities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_healing.htm">Restoration and Healing</a></b><br>The ultimate goal of these laws is restoration, pointing to the healing and cleansing available through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_13_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 13:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_13_25_s_role_in_spiritual_purity.htm">How does Leviticus 13:25 guide us in discerning spiritual impurities today?

This inspection<p>&#8226; protects the congregation from contamination (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2&#8211;3</a>),<p>&#8226; preserves the purity of worship (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>), and<p>&#8226; reminds the sick person that restoration ultimately comes from the Lord (<a href="/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>).<p>By requiring a priestly examination rather than private self-diagnosis, the passage underlines God&#8217;s concern for order, accountability, and compassionate oversight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hair Turned White</b><p>Next, the text notes, &#8220;If the hair in the spot has turned white.&#8221; Earlier instructions treat whitened hair as a telltale sign of leprous disease (<a href="/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3, 10, 20</a>). A color change signals that the condition is progressing beneath the surface, not merely lingering on top. Ironically, what looks &#8220;white&#8221; is not purity but corruption&#8212;an early hint that outward appearances can mislead (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> within context of sin; cf. <a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Deeper Than the Skin</b><p>The priest also looks to see whether &#8220;the spot appears to be deeper than the skin.&#8221; In other words, the harm penetrates beyond surface tissue, indicating systemic infection (<a href="/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3</a>). Spiritually this mirrors the truth that defilement springs from the heart, not mere externals (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21&#8211;23</a>). God&#8217;s assessment always reaches &#8220;to the division of soul and spirit&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), exposing what lies beneath respectable fa&#231;ades.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Disease in the Burn</b><p>&#8220;It is a disease that has broken out in the burn.&#8221; Burns were common in ancient life, and a secondary infection could easily spread (<a href="/leviticus/13-24.htm">Leviticus 13:24</a>). God supplies detailed criteria so even a painful injury receives careful attention rather than dismissal. The Creator who permitted the burn also provides clarity for handling its complications (<a href="/2_kings/20-7.htm">2 Kings 20:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>). Compassion shows up in precision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pronounced Unclean</b><p>&#8220;The priest must pronounce him unclean.&#8221; The declaration does not cause uncleanness; it simply confirms reality (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45&#8211;46</a>). Isolation follows, but so does the hope of future cleansing (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2&#8211;3</a>). Jesus, honoring this very protocol, sent healed lepers back to the priests (<a href="/luke/5-14.htm">Luke 5:14</a>; 17:14), proving that God&#8217;s law points ahead to gracious restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Diseased Infection</b><p>Finally, the verse concludes, &#8220;it is a diseased infection.&#8221; The wording stacks terms&#8212;disease, infection&#8212;to stress seriousness. Left unchecked, it threatens both individual and community welfare (<a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5&#8211;6</a>). Sin works the same way: subtle at first, spreading deeply, demanding decisive treatment (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>). God&#8217;s law exposes the need so His mercy can supply the cure (<a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-25.htm">Leviticus 13:25</a> details a priestly protocol for diagnosing a burn that has become leprous. Each diagnostic marker&#8212;white hair, depth below the skin, spreading in a burn&#8212;guards Israel&#8217;s purity and prefigures the gospel truth that sin runs deeper than appearances. The priest&#8217;s verdict of &#8220;unclean&#8221; is not condemnation without hope but a vital step toward eventual cleansing. By insisting on careful examination, God shows both His holiness and His compassionate intention to restore all who submit to His prescribed remedy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Then the priest shall look.</span>--If upon examination the priest finds that the hair which was before black has now turned white.<p><span class= "bld">And it be in sight deeper than the skin.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and its appearance is deeper than the other skin. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/13-3.htm" title="And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.">Leviticus 13:3</a>;
