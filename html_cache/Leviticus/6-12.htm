In the ancient Near Eastern context, fire often represented divine presence and purification. This command underscores the importance of maintaining a constant state of readiness and devotion to God. The fire's perpetual nature can be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit, who continually works within believers.<p><b>it must not be extinguished.</b><br>The unceasing nature of the altar fire signifies the eternal covenant between God and Israel. It reflects the necessity of constant vigilance in spiritual matters, emphasizing that worship and devotion to God are not to be intermittent. This can be connected to the New Testament call for believers to "pray without ceasing" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>), highlighting a life of continual worship and dedication.<p><b>Every morning the priest is to add wood to the fire,</b><br>The daily addition of wood by the priest signifies the regular and disciplined approach required in maintaining one's relationship with God. This act of adding wood can be seen as a metaphor for daily spiritual practices such as prayer, reading Scripture, and worship. The priest's role here prefigures Christ as our High Priest, who continually intercedes for us (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>arrange the burnt offering on it,</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah," was a sacrifice of complete consecration to God, symbolizing total surrender and devotion. The arrangement of the offering indicates order and intentionality in worship. This offering points to Jesus Christ, who offered Himself completely to God on our behalf (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>and burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on it.</b><br>The fat portions, considered the best part of the animal, were given to God as a sign of honor and reverence. The peace offering, or "shelamim," symbolized fellowship and reconciliation with God. This act foreshadows the peace and reconciliation brought through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The burning of the fat portions signifies giving God the best of what we have, reflecting the call to love God with all our heart, soul, and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests were responsible for maintaining the fire on the altar, symbolizing their role as mediators between God and the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The altar was a central place of worship in the Tabernacle, where sacrifices were made to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice that was completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offerings.htm">Peace Offerings</a></b><br>These offerings were made to express gratitude and fellowship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_consistency_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Consistency in Worship</a></b><br>Just as the fire on the altar was to be kept burning continually, our worship and devotion to God should be consistent and unwavering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">Role of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>The priests' responsibility to maintain the altar fire underscores the importance of spiritual leaders in guiding and sustaining the faith of the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_fire.htm">Symbolism of Fire</a></b><br>Fire represents God's presence, purity, and judgment.

God Himself lit this fire originally (<a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>), marking it as holy and distinct. The priests&#8217; task was not to ignite a new blaze but to steward what the LORD had already begun.<p>&#8226; The flame pictured God&#8217;s continual presence among His people (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42&#8211;46</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminded Israel that atonement is an ongoing need; sin never takes a day off, so the provision for covering it could not pause (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament picks up this imagery: &#8220;Our God is a consuming fire&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).

The command in Leviticus guards against that very condition&#8212;allowing spiritual fervor to cool.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every morning the priest is to add wood to the fire</b><p>&#8220;Every morning the priest is to add wood to the fire&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>c). The routine was daily, not occasional.<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in small, repeated acts keeps spiritual life healthy; manna also came daily (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Wood speaks of provision that costs something&#8212;someone had to cut, carry, and stack it. Worship requires tangible effort (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus rose early for prayer (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>), modeling an everyday rhythm of renewal.

Paul draws the straight line: &#8220;Offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest had to place the sacrifice properly, suggesting order and intentionality in worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; When Elijah rebuilt the ruined altar and laid the sacrifice in order (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30&#8211;38</a>), fire fell again, showing that careful obedience invites fresh divine response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on it&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>e).

God still reserves first place in every blessing He grants.<p>&#8226; The sequence matters: first the burnt offering (total consecration), then the peace offering (shared fellowship). True communion flows out of undivided commitment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a> teaches that God-given fire must be tended continually, never allowed to die out.
