In the context of offerings, leaven is prohibited to signify purity and holiness. This requirement underscores the need for offerings to be free from impurity, reflecting the holiness of God. In the New Testament, Jesus warns against the "leaven of the Pharisees," which represents hypocrisy and false teaching (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>). The absence of leaven in offerings can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was without sin.<p><b>I have assigned it as their portion of My food offerings.</b><br>This phrase indicates that a portion of the offerings is designated for the priests. The priests, who serve in the temple, rely on these portions for their sustenance, as they do not have land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-21</a>). This provision highlights God's care for those who serve Him and the community's responsibility to support their spiritual leaders. It also reflects the communal aspect of worship, where offerings benefit both God and His servants.<p><b>It is most holy,</b><br>The designation "most holy" signifies the highest level of sanctity. Items or offerings deemed "most holy" are set apart for God and must be handled with the utmost reverence and care. This status is reserved for offerings that are directly related to atonement and reconciliation with God. The holiness of these offerings points to the seriousness of sin and the need for a pure and acceptable sacrifice, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>like the sin offering and the guilt offering.</b><br>The sin offering and the guilt offering are both sacrifices made for atonement, addressing different aspects of sin and guilt. The sin offering deals with unintentional sins and purification, while the guilt offering addresses specific transgressions and restitution. Both offerings emphasize the need for repentance and reconciliation with God. They prefigure the atoning work of Christ, who fulfills the requirements of both offerings through His death and resurrection, providing complete forgiveness and restoration for believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, through whom God delivered the laws and commandments, including those in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The priests who were given specific instructions on how to conduct offerings and sacrifices, including the grain offering mentioned in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where the Israelites worshiped and where offerings were made to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Law to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_made_by_fire.htm">Offerings Made by Fire</a></b><br>Sacrificial offerings that were burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_offerings.htm">Holiness of Offerings</a></b><br>The grain offering, like the sin and guilt offerings, is described as "most holy."

By forbidding yeast in this grain offering, God highlights His demand for purity in worship. The priests, who represent the people before the LORD, must handle an offering untouched by fermentation&#8212;an acted-out sermon that sin cannot mingle with devotion. <a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a> reinforces, &#8220;Every grain offering you bring to the LORD must be made without yeast.&#8221; The lesson is simple: approach God on His terms, not with a mixture of holy intention and hidden compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have assigned it as their portion of My food offerings</b><p>God provides for His priests through certain sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a>; 7:31&#8211;34). This &#8220;portion&#8221; isn&#8217;t a bonus; it&#8217;s His deliberate provision. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1&#8211;3</a> reminds us that the Levites &#8220;have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance.&#8221; Their sustenance flows directly from the altar, underscoring that ministry depends on God&#8217;s faithfulness, not human schemes. The New Testament echoes the pattern: &#8220;Those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is most holy</b><p>&#8220;Most holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>) signals the highest degree of sanctity.

Think of Moses at the burning bush&#8212;&#8220;Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>).
