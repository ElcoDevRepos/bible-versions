The priesthood was established in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, where Aaron and his sons were set apart for service in the tabernacle. This highlights the importance of the priestly role in maintaining the sanctity of worship and offerings.<p><b>to treat with respect the sacred offerings</b><br>The sacred offerings refer to the various sacrifices and gifts brought by the Israelites to the tabernacle. These offerings were a central part of Israelite worship, as outlined in Leviticus chapters 1-7. The priests were responsible for handling these offerings with reverence, ensuring that the worship of God was conducted in a manner that honored Him.<p><b>that the Israelites have consecrated to Me</b><br>The offerings were consecrated, meaning they were set apart for God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where certain people, places, and things are dedicated to God&#8217;s service. The Israelites&#8217; act of consecration was a physical demonstration of their devotion and obedience to God.<p><b>so that they do not profane My holy name</b><br>Profaning God&#8217;s name would occur if the offerings were mishandled or treated with contempt. This underscores the seriousness of the priests' duties and the need for purity in worship. The concept of God&#8217;s name being holy is echoed in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>) and throughout Scripture, emphasizing the reverence due to God.<p><b>I am the LORD</b><br>This statement serves as a reminder of God&#8217;s authority and identity. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) is significant, as it is God&#8217;s covenant name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>.
