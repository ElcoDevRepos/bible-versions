In the ancient Israelite context, contact with a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>. The high priest, serving as the spiritual leader and mediator between God and the people, was held to a higher standard of holiness. This separation from death symbolizes the separation from sin and corruption, reflecting God's holiness. The prohibition underscores the sanctity of life and the priest's role in representing life and purity before God.<p><b>he must not defile himself,</b><br>The concept of defilement in Levitical law pertains to becoming ritually impure, which would disqualify the high priest from performing his sacred duties. This requirement highlights the importance of maintaining a state of holiness, as the high priest was a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-15</a>). Jesus, who is sinless, did not defile Himself but took on the sins of the world, providing a way for humanity to be reconciled with God. The high priest's avoidance of defilement prefigures Christ's perfect purity and His role in offering a perfect sacrifice.<p><b>even for his father or mother.</b><br>This phrase illustrates the extent of the high priest's commitment to his divine duties, even above familial obligations. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, honoring one's parents was a significant commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), yet the high priest's service to God took precedence. This reflects the principle that devotion to God must surpass all other loyalties, as seen in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>. The high priest's separation from mourning rituals for close family members underscores the total dedication required in serving God, foreshadowing the complete devotion Christ demonstrated in His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, the high priest in Israel, held a unique and sacred role, serving as the spiritual leader and mediator between God and the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dead_body.htm">Dead Body</a></b><br>Refers to the deceased, contact with whom would render a person ceremonially unclean according to the Levitical law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_and_mother.htm">Father and Mother</a></b><br>Represents the closest familial relationships, highlighting the severity of the high priest's restrictions even in the face of personal loss.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The high priest's restrictions underscore the call to holiness and separation from impurity.

The high priest could not afford any interruption in his mediatory duties.<p>&#8226; The contrast with Jesus, our great High Priest who touched the dead to raise them (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-15</a>), highlights His superior, life-imparting purity that fulfills the shadow of the Levitical ordinances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must not defile himself</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He must not defile himself&#8221; reiterates the spiritual danger of impurity. Defilement is not merely ritual but symbolizes the moral gulf between human death (the wages of sin, <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>) and the holiness of God (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a> records how unauthorized approaches to God cost Nadab and Abihu their lives; the high priest&#8217;s holiness safeguards both himself and the people he represents (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> applies a similar standard to future priests, showing the enduring principle of maintaining holiness in God&#8217;s service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even for his father or mother</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Even for his father or mother&#8221; shows that the demand for holiness surpasses the strongest earthly ties (compare <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>, where loyalty to Christ is above family).<p>&#8226; Ordinary priests could mourn for close relatives (<a href="/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2-3</a>), but the high priest&#8217;s consecration (<a href="/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>) bound him to a higher standard. The anointing oil on his head (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>) symbolized a perpetual, public dedication that must not be compromised.<p>&#8226; Jesus affirmed this principle when He prioritized the Father&#8217;s will over family expectations (<a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>; <a href="/mark/3-31.htm">Mark 3:31-35</a>), prefiguring the perfect obedience that the Levitical high priest could only model imperfectly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> commands the high priest to avoid corpse-contact, guarding him from any defilement that would interrupt his continual ministry before the LORD. The prohibition, extending even to the death of immediate family, highlights the surpassing priority of divine holiness over natural affections. Cross-scriptural echoes reveal that this strict standard points forward to Christ, the sinless High Priest whose purity not only remained intact among the dead but triumphed over death itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Neither shall he go in to any dead body.</span>--Not only is he to abstain from the manifestation of sorrow for the troubles which befell the community, or those whom he loves, but in the case of death he is not to enter into a tent, house, or place where a human corpse was lying (<a href="/numbers/19-14.htm" title="This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:14</a>), lest he should contract defilement. According to the administrators of the Law during the second Temple, the expression <span class= "ital">any dead body </span>extends to any portion of it, so that when the pontiff entered a place where a certain quantity of the blood of the dead body was to be found, he became defiled. Accordingly, "any dead soul," which is literally the meaning of the phrase here translated by "dead body," denotes the blood which constitutes the soul or life. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Nor defile himself for his father . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">not for his father </span>. . . <span class= "ital">shall he defile himself </span>or, <span class= "ital">not even for his father, </span>&c. As the rigorous enactment in the preceding clause constitutes already the difference between the high priest and the ordinary priest, this clause simply adduces an instance to illustrate it. Whilst the ordinary priest was not only permitted, but even obliged, to attend the funeral ceremonies of no less than seven of his relations (see <a href="/context/leviticus/21-2.htm" title="But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.">Leviticus 21:2-3</a>), the high priest was not even allowed to join in the obsequies of his parents. The only exception made in his case was when he found a human body in an isolated place. Under such circumstances he was not only permitted, but it was a meritorious act on his part, to bury it. (See <a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:">Leviticus 21:1</a>.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/21-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">near any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dead</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">body</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><br /><span class="word">or make himself unclean,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7789;&#183;&#7789;am&#183;m&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2930.htm">Strong's 2930: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become unclean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even for his father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
