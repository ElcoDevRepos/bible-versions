The mention of an "uncle or cousin or any close relative" highlights the importance of family and kinship in ancient Israelite society. The Hebrew term "goel" (redeemer) is significant here, as it refers to a family member who has the responsibility to restore the economic and social well-being of a relative. This practice ensured that families could maintain their inheritance and social standing. The role of the redeemer is a precursor to the concept of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Redeemer, who restores humanity's relationship with God. The idea of a close relative stepping in to redeem is also seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz, where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.</b><br>This phrase introduces the possibility of self-redemption, which underscores the value of personal responsibility and initiative. In the ancient Near Eastern context, economic hardship could lead to a person selling themselves into servitude. However, the provision for self-redemption allowed individuals the opportunity to regain their freedom and property if their circumstances improved. This reflects the biblical principle of hope and restoration, emphasizing that one's current situation is not necessarily permanent. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual redemption, where individuals are encouraged to seek reconciliation with God. The notion of self-redemption also aligns with the broader biblical theme of repentance and renewal, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where turning back to God leads to healing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncle_or_cousin.htm">Uncle or Cousin</a></b><br>These family members are

Every fiftieth year, land returned to original families and Israelites who had sold themselves into servitude were released (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10&#8211;13</a>). The backdrop for verse 49 is therefore economic hardship, not criminal punishment. God protects His covenant people from permanent slavery, reflecting His earlier deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;either his uncle &#8230; may redeem him&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The first named redeemer is the paternal uncle, usually the next&#8208;oldest male after the father.<p>&#8226; This underscores family solidarity: the nearest capable relative steps in when tragedy strikes, much as Boaz later does for Naomi and Ruth (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Redemption is concrete: the uncle pays the remaining value of the servant&#8217;s labor to the master (<a href="/leviticus/25-52.htm">Leviticus 25:52</a>). The servant immediately regains freedom and ancestral land rights (<a href="/leviticus/25-28.htm">Leviticus 25:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;or [his] cousin&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; If no uncle can help, responsibility widens to a cousin. The line of potential redeemers ripples outward, ensuring no Israelite is forgotten.<p>&#8226; The principle mirrors <a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8&#8211;11</a>, where inheritance passes to successively distant relatives, preserving family identity and property within the tribe (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;or any close relative from his clan&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The term &#8220;close relative&#8221; gathers every other kinship tie inside the clan. Whether brother, nephew, or even an in-law, whoever can afford to act must do so (<a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; God places duty above convenience, insisting that freedom for a kinsman outweigh personal plans or costs (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a> reflects the same heart).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;may redeem him&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Redemption here is not charity alone; it restores a full covenant standing. The released servant is again a free citizen under God&#8217;s theocratic order (<a href="/leviticus/25-55.htm">Leviticus 25:55</a>).<p>&#8226; Legally, the redeemer settles an assigned price calculated by years remaining until Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-50.htm">Leviticus 25:50&#8211;51</a>). Spiritually, the act echoes God&#8217;s pattern of substitutionary rescue (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God values personal responsibility alongside communal duty.

No Israelite is destined to remain poor; upward movement is possible under God&#8217;s covenant promises (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Even self-redemption follows God&#8217;s lawful terms, preventing exploitation by the master (<a href="/leviticus/25-53.htm">Leviticus 25:53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living implications</b><p>&#8226; Family bears first responsibility to rescue kin from destructive circumstances (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God calls His people to tangible, costly compassion, not mere sentiment (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, earthly patterns of redemption point to Christ, our perfect Kinsman-Redeemer who paid the price none of us could afford (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/25-49.htm">Leviticus 25:49</a> teaches that an Israelite enslaved by debt can be bought back either by his nearest relatives or, if blessed with prosperity, by his own hand.

Hence the Jewish canons enacted that "if a Hebrew is sold to a stranger, and is unable to redeem himself, his kinsmen must redeem, nay, the Sanhedrin are to compel his kinsmen to redeem him lest he should be lost among the heathen. If his kindred do not redeem him, and if he cannot redeem himself, every man of Israel is commanded to redeem him. But if he is sold to an Israelite his kindred may not redeem him, nor may he borrow money to redeem himself, nor redeem himself by instalments." In accordance with this injunction we find the Jews declare "we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews which were sold unto the heathen, and will ye even sell your brethren, or shall they be sold unto us?" (<a href="/nehemiah/5-8.htm" title="And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.">Nehemiah 5:8</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">either</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his uncle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1465;&#1491;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
