This phrase indicates the completion of a purification process, emphasizing the transition from unclean to clean status. The setting sun marks the end of a period of uncleanness, aligning with the natural order established by God.<p><b>he will become clean</b><br>This phrase highlights the ritual purity laws central to Levitical code. Becoming clean was essential for priests to perform their duties and partake in sacred offerings. The process of becoming clean often involved washing and waiting until evening, symbolizing a renewal or restoration of holiness. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s holiness and the need for His people to be set apart.<p><b>and then he may eat from the sacred offerings</b><br>The sacred offerings, or "holy things," were portions of sacrifices designated for the priests and their families. Eating these offerings was both a privilege and a responsibility, signifying participation in the covenant community. This practice underscores the importance of maintaining purity to engage in worship and service to God.<p><b>for they are his food</b><br>The offerings provided sustenance for the priests, who did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel. This provision illustrates God&#8217;s care for those who serve Him, ensuring their needs are met through the community's worship practices. It also points to the spiritual nourishment found in fulfilling God&#8217;s commands, prefiguring the sustenance believers find in Christ, the Bread of Life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary audience of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/22.htm">Leviticus 22</a>, the priests were responsible for maintaining ritual purity to serve in the temple and partake in sacred offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_offerings.htm">Sacred Offerings</a></b><br>These are the portions of sacrifices designated for the priests, which they could consume only when ritually clean.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity.htm">Ritual Purity</a></b><br>A state required for priests to perform their duties and partake in offerings, emphasizing the holiness required in service to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sunset.htm">Sunset</a></b><br>The time marking the end of a day and the beginning of a new one, symbolizing a transition from impurity to purity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle/temple.htm">Tabernacle/Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship where offerings were made and consumed by the priests.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity_and_holiness.htm">Ritual Purity and Holiness</a></b><br>The requirement for priests to be clean before eating sacred offerings underscores the importance of holiness in approaching God.

At sunset the priest is automatically cleansed, immediately restored to his right to eat God&#8217;s holy food&#8212;the very sustenance of his family. The verse showcases God&#8217;s orderly grace: He sets the boundary (sunset), grants the cleansing, welcomes His servant back to fellowship, and supplies daily needs. All of it foreshadows the fuller cleansing and ongoing provision we now enjoy in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And shall afterward eat . . . because it is his food.</span>--As the sacrifices which were the perquisites of the officiating priests were the only things he had to live upon, the priest who had contracted defilement had virtually to go without food till sundown, when he purified himself by the prescribed lustrations.<p><span class= "bld">That which dieth of itself.</span>--That is, clean animals or birds which have not been properly slaughtered, but have met with an accident.
