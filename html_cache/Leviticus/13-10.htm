Their role in examining skin diseases highlights the integration of spiritual and physical well-being in the community. This examination was crucial for maintaining the purity and holiness of the camp, as outlined in Leviticus. The priest's involvement underscores the belief that health issues could have spiritual implications, and it was essential to address them according to God's law.<p><b>and if there is a white swelling on the skin</b><br>The description of a "white swelling" refers to a visible change in the skin that could indicate a serious condition, such as leprosy. In the ancient Near East, skin diseases were often feared due to their potential to spread and cause ritual impurity. The color white in this context is significant because it was associated with purity and cleanliness, yet here it indicates a potential problem, showing the complexity of interpreting signs of disease.<p><b>that has turned the hair white</b><br>The turning of hair white in the affected area was a diagnostic sign for the priest. This change in hair color was a key indicator of the severity of the skin condition. In biblical times, such physical signs were crucial for distinguishing between different types of skin diseases, some of which required isolation from the community. This detail emphasizes the thoroughness required in the priestly examination process.<p><b>and there is raw flesh in the swelling</b><br>The presence of raw flesh within the swelling indicated a more severe and potentially contagious condition. In the context of Leviticus, raw flesh was a sign of uncleanness and required immediate attention. This aspect of the examination highlights the importance of maintaining ritual purity and preventing the spread of disease within the community. The raw flesh could symbolize the deeper spiritual impurity that needed to be addressed through the priestly system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests were responsible for maintaining the holiness of the community, including diagnosing and managing skin diseases.

Literally, these rules protected Israel&#8217;s health and upheld covenant holiness. Spiritually, they expose sin&#8217;s depth and danger: what begins small can penetrate, discolor, and break open our lives. Yet the same Lord who required examination also provided cleansing. The passage calls us to invite Christ&#8217;s searching eye, receive His atoning touch, and live in the purity He graciously supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">If the rising be white.</span>--If the distemper actually returns, one of two symptoms indicates it. A white rising will be noticed in the skin, which changes the black hair into white. The white hair only then indicates the disorder when it co-exists with the white rising or swelling which produced it. If the original white swelling, which discoloured the hair, disappears, and a fresh white swelling forms itself around the existing white hair, it is no indication of uncleanness.<p><span class= "bld">And there be quick raw flesh in the rising.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">or if there be, </span>or <span class= "ital">and likewise if there be, &c. </span>This clause gives the second of the two symptoms, either of which indicates the return of the disorder. According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, the phrase here translated "quick raw flesh" in the Authorised Version, which literally means "the quickening of live flesh," denotes "sound flesh," or a spot in the flesh assuming the appearance of life after it had been paled by the whiteness which overspread the whole surface. The size of this spot of live flesh, which indicated the disease and made the patient unclean, had to be at least that of a lentil. This rendering is given by the LXX,, the Chaldee, &c. An insulated spot of sound flesh in the midst of a tubercle was considered a sign of the fretting and consuming progress which the disease made in the surrounding flesh.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
