The command to "come here" signifies the need for swift action to prevent further defilement of the sanctuary area.<p><b>carry the bodies of your cousins</b><br>The bodies referred to are those of Nadab and Abihu, who were struck down by God for offering unauthorized fire.

The camp represents the dwelling place of God among His people, and anything unclean must be removed to preserve the holiness of the community.<p><b>away from the front of the sanctuary.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the sanctity of the sanctuary area, where God's presence dwelt.

As Amram was the father of Aaron, Uzziel was the uncle of Aaron. Uzziel had three sons, of whom Mishael and Elzaphan were two (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm" title="And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.">Exodus 6:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-22.htm" title="And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.">Exodus 6:22</a>). Eleazar and Ithamar, as ordinary priests, might have been employed in removing the remains of their slain brothers. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>) Naturally they were too much affected by this appalling scene; Moses therefore wanted to spare their feelings, and hence charged their cousins-german with the task of carrying away the dead bodies. The reason why Izar and Hebron, the two older uncles of Aaron, are here passed over is because the discontent of their children with the choice of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood, which afterward broke out in open rebellion on the part of Korah, Izar's son (Numbers 16, 17), had evidently begun to show itself when they witnessed the imposing ceremonies of the consecration. It was necessary that those who suffered so signally for the transgression of the Divine institutions should be buried by men whose allegiance to God's law was unimpeachable.<p><span class= "bld">Carry your brethren.</span>--That is, your kinsmen.
