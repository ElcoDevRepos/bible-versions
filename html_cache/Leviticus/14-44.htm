Their involvement in matters of cleanliness and disease reflects the intertwining of physical and spiritual purity. The priest's inspection signifies the importance of divine authority in determining the state of cleanliness, emphasizing that God is concerned with both the spiritual and physical well-being of His people. This role of the priest foreshadows Christ as our High Priest, who inspects and cleanses us from sin.<p><b>If the mildew has spread in the house,</b><br>Mildew, or mold, in a house was not merely a physical issue but also a spiritual one, as it rendered the house ceremonially unclean. The spread of mildew can be seen as a metaphor for sin, which, if not addressed, can permeate and corrupt. This reflects the biblical principle that sin, like mildew, must be identified and dealt with promptly to prevent further contamination. The spread of mildew also highlights the need for vigilance and regular inspection, akin to the believer's need for self-examination and repentance.<p><b>it is a destructive mildew;</b><br>The term "destructive" indicates the severity of the mildew's impact, not only on the physical structure but also on the spiritual state of those dwelling within. This destruction can be likened to the consequences of unchecked sin, which can lead to spiritual decay and separation from God. The destructive nature of mildew serves as a warning of the potential devastation of sin, urging believers to seek cleansing and restoration.<p><b>the house is unclean.</b><br>Declaring the house unclean had significant implications, as it required the inhabitants to take action to restore purity. This declaration underscores the importance of holiness and the need for separation from anything that defiles. In a broader biblical context, the concept of uncleanness points to humanity's need for redemption and the ultimate cleansing provided through Jesus Christ. The unclean house serves as a reminder of the pervasive nature of sin and the necessity of divine intervention for purification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

href="/leviticus/14-44.htm">Leviticus 14:44</a> begins, &#8220;the priest must come and inspect it.&#8221; The law places diagnosis in the hands of God-appointed leadership, not the homeowner&#8217;s private opinion (cf. <a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>- The priest represents the LORD&#8217;s holiness to the covenant community; his visit affirms that no contamination is overlooked (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: believers invite spiritual examination. Paul says, &#8220;Examine yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>), and faithful shepherds &#8220;watch over your souls&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the mildew has spread in the house</b><p>- The verse continues, &#8220;If the mildew has spread in the house.&#8221; Ongoing, unchecked growth is the key test (cf. <a href="/leviticus/14-39.htm">Leviticus 14:39</a>).<p>- Scripture often pictures sin as something that spreads: &#8220;their teaching will spread like gangrene&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>) and &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole lump&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<p>- The law underscores vigilance: initial cleansing efforts are not enough if new spots appear. Perseverance in watchfulness is essential (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is a destructive mildew</b><p>- The Hebrew term behind &#8220;destructive&#8221; marks seriousness; this infestation cannot be safely ignored. &#8220;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>), and sin works the same ruin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>- <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a> shows the progression: desire&#8212;sin&#8212;death. What looks minor becomes lethal when it corrupts the structure itself.<p>- God&#8217;s people are warned that certain patterns, relationships, or doctrines, once proven destructive, must be dealt with decisively (<a href="/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The house is unclean</b><p>- Final verdict: &#8220;the house is unclean.&#8221; Under the law this meant evacuation, dismantling of affected stones, or complete demolition (<a href="/leviticus/14-45.htm">Leviticus 14:45</a>).<p>- Uncleanness barred fellowship and worship until addressed (<a href="/numbers/19-20.htm">Numbers 19:20</a>). Today, God calls His people His house: &#8220;you are God&#8217;s temple&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>).<p>- When uncleanness appears, cleansing is not optional. He promises, &#8220;I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>). Repentance and renewal restore the dwelling place of God (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-44.htm">Leviticus 14:44</a> teaches that God assigns qualified servants to evaluate contamination; spreading corruption demands renewed scrutiny; destructive infection requires decisive action; and anything left uncleansed forfeits fellowship. Literally, mildew made a house unfit; spiritually, unchecked sin renders lives and communities uninhabitable for God&#8217;s presence. The passage urges ongoing self-examination, swift response to spreading sin, and wholehearted pursuit of cleansing so that the dwelling remains holy to the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
