The use of "LORD" in all capital letters signifies the translation of the Tetragrammaton, YHWH, the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. This divine communication underscores the authority and sacredness of the instructions that follow, which pertain to the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>Moses, as the mediator of the Old Covenant, is a type of Christ, who is the mediator of the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). Just as Moses received the law and instructions from God to guide the Israelites, Jesus provides the ultimate revelation of God and His will for humanity. The setting of this communication is likely at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites camped for an extended period, receiving the law and building the tabernacle. This location is significant as it represents a pivotal moment in Israel's history, where they are established as a nation under God's law.<br><br>The historical context of this passage is the establishment of the Levitical priesthood, a critical development in Israel's religious life. The priesthood served as a means for the people to maintain a relationship with God through sacrifices and offerings, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is holy and righteous, and who communicates His will to His people through His chosen leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive His laws and commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting (implied context)</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and where the consecration of Aaron and his sons would take place, as described in the following verses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and his sons (implied context)</a></b><br>The individuals who were to be consecrated as priests to serve in the Tabernacle, representing the people before God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_consecration_ceremony.htm">The Consecration Ceremony (implied context)</a></b><br>The event that follows in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>, where Aaron and his sons are set apart for priestly service, involving specific rituals and offerings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_initiative_in_leadership.htm">God's Initiative in Leadership</a></b><br>God is the one who initiates and calls individuals to leadership and service.
