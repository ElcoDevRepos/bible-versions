The use of "nevertheless" connects this command to the preceding discussion on mutual submission and the relationship between Christ and the Church. The command to love one's wife "as he loves himself" echoes the second greatest commandment found in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>, "Love your neighbor as yourself." This self-love is not selfishness but a recognition of one's own needs and well-being, which should be extended to one's spouse. The cultural context of the time placed husbands in a position of authority, but this directive calls for a sacrificial, Christ-like love that prioritizes the wife's needs and well-being. This love mirrors Christ's love for the Church, as described earlier in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is the model for husbands.<p><b>and the wife must respect her husband</b><br>The instruction for wives to respect their husbands complements the command for husbands to love their wives. Respect in this context involves recognizing the husband's role and leadership within the marriage, as outlined in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>, where wives are called to submit to their husbands as to the Lord. This respect is not about inferiority but about honoring the God-given roles within the marriage. The cultural backdrop of the Greco-Roman world often viewed women as subordinate, but this biblical instruction elevates the relationship to one of mutual honor and love. The concept of respect is also tied to the fear of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>, where a woman who fears the Lord is praised. This respect is a reflection of the Church's reverence for Christ, as the Church submits to Christ's headship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.
