In the Greco-Roman world, marriage was often seen as a social contract rather than a relationship based on love. This directive challenges cultural norms by elevating the role of love in marriage. The Greek word for love used here is "agape," which denotes a selfless, sacrificial love. This sets a high standard for husbands, calling them to love their wives with the same depth and commitment that Christ has for the church.<p><b>just as Christ loved the church</b><br>This phrase sets the standard for the type of love husbands should have for their wives. Christ's love for the church is unconditional, sacrificial, and eternal. It is a love that seeks the well-being and spiritual growth of the church. This comparison elevates the marital relationship to a spiritual level, where the husband is called to reflect Christ's love. The church, in this context, refers to the collective body of believers, highlighting the communal and covenantal nature of Christ's love.<p><b>and gave Himself up for her</b><br>This refers to the ultimate sacrifice Christ made by dying on the cross for the sins of humanity. It underscores the depth of Christ's love, which is willing to endure suffering and death for the sake of the church. This act of giving Himself up is a model for husbands, who are called to prioritize their wives' needs and well-being above their own. The sacrificial nature of this love is a call to action, urging husbands to embody a love that is active and self-giving. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of redemption and the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/husbands.htm">Husbands</a></b><br>In this passage, husbands are addressed directly, emphasizing their role within the marriage relationship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wives.htm">Wives</a></b><br>Although not directly addressed in this verse, wives are the recipients of the love and sacrificial care that husbands are commanded to provide.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The ultimate example of sacrificial love, Christ's relationship with the church serves as the model for husbands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>Represents the collective body of believers, whom Christ loved and for whom He sacrificed Himself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance and instruction to the early Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_love.htm">Sacrificial Love</a></b><br>Husbands are called to love their wives with the same selflessness and sacrifice that Christ demonstrated for the church.

Only so far as the husband shows the like love in perfect sympathy, in chivalrous forbearance, in abhorrence of tyranny, in willingness to self-sacrifice, has he any right to claim lordship.<p><span class= "bld">And gave himself for it.</span>--Here, as before, the antitype transcends the type. In the character of our Lord's sacrifice, as an atonement offered "for" the Church, and in the regenerating and cleansing effect of that sacrifice (see next verse), none can approach Him. The husband may be said to give himself for his wife, but it cannot be in any higher sense than as taking the chief share of the burden, and if possible the pain, of life for her. He may follow Christ in love, and in that alone. Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, "I fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for His body's sake, which is the Church" (where see Note).<p>(25-27) In these verses we trace, under the nuptial metaphor, a clear description of the three great stages in salvation--justification in His "giving Himself for us, sanctification in the "cleansing by water in the Word," glorification in the final "presentation" to Christ in glory. The metaphor is certainly preserved in the last two clauses, which correspond to the bath of purification of the bride, and the festal presentation of her (usually by the friend of the bridegroom, <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>), in all her beauty and adornment, to her husband at his own home; perhaps even in the first also, for the husband used to give a dowry, which was held in the rude simplicity of ancient times to purchase his wife, and here that which Christ gives is the unspeakable price of His own Self. Throughout, in accordance with the whole tenor of the Epistle, it is the Church as a whole, not the individual soul, which is "the Spouse of Christ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for her.</span> The husband's duty to the wife is enforced by another parallel - it ought to correspond to Christ's love for the Church. This parallel restores the balance; if it should seem hard for the wife to be in subjection, the spirit of love, Christ-like love, on the part of the husband makes the duty easy. Christ did not merely pity the Church, or merely desire her good, but loved her; her image was stamped on his heart and her name graven on his hands; he desired to have her for his companion, longing for a return of her affection, for the establishment of sympathy between her and him. And he gave himself for her (comp. ver. 2), showing that her happiness and welfare were dearer to him than his own - the true test of deep, real love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Husbands,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(andres)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male human being; a man, husband.
