Paul addresses masters directly, urging them to treat their slaves with the same respect and fairness that he previously instructed slaves to show their masters. This reflects the radical nature of Christian ethics, which calls for mutual respect and love regardless of social status. The phrase "do the same" implies a reciprocal relationship, emphasizing the Golden Rule found in <a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>.<p><b>Give up your use of threats,</b><br>Paul instructs masters to abandon the use of threats, which were a common method of control in the Roman world. This command challenges the cultural norms of the time, promoting a new way of leadership based on love and respect rather than fear and intimidation. This aligns with Jesus' teachings on servant leadership, as seen in <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>, where greatness is defined by serving others.<p><b>because you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven,</b><br>This phrase underscores the Christian belief in the ultimate authority of God over all people, regardless of earthly status. It reminds masters that they, too, are under the authority of Christ, who is the true Master. This heavenly perspective encourages humility and accountability, as seen in <a href="/colossians/4.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>, where masters are reminded to provide what is right and fair because they have a Master in heaven.<p><b>and there is no favoritism with Him.</b><br>God's impartiality is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing that all people are equal before Him. This is echoed in passages like <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a> and <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>, which affirm that God does not show favoritism. This principle challenges societal hierarchies and calls believers to reflect God's justice and equality in their relationships, promoting a community where love and fairness prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance to the early Christian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesians.htm">Ephesians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/masters.htm">Masters</a></b><br>Refers to those in positions of authority over servants or slaves in the context of the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants/slaves.htm">Servants/Slaves</a></b><br>Individuals under the authority of masters, addressed in the preceding verses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God, emphasizing the divine authority and impartiality of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/equality_before_god.htm">Equality Before God</a></b><br>Recognize that all people, regardless of social status, are equal in the eyes of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_responsibility.htm">Authority and Responsibility</a></b><br>Those in positions of authority should exercise their power with humility and fairness, reflecting God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/impartiality_in_leadership.htm">Impartiality in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders should avoid favoritism and threats, understanding that they are accountable to God for their actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/servant_leadership.htm">Servant Leadership</a></b><br>Embrace a leadership style that serves others, following the example of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god.htm">Accountability to God</a></b><br>Remember that all actions are ultimately accountable to God, who judges impartially.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_6_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 6:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Eph_6_9_s_impact_on_Christian_bosses.htm">How should Ephesians 6:9 influence a Christian employer's treatment of employees?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_no_favoritism_reveal.htm">What does "no favoritism with Him" reveal about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ephesians_6_9_Colossians_4_1.htm">How does Ephesians 6:9 connect with Colossians 4:1 regarding masters and servants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_leaders_apply_do_the_same.htm">In what ways can leaders implement "do the same to them" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_6_9_s_advice_for_leaders.htm">How can Ephesians 6:9 guide Christians in positions of authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_6_9_modern_master-slave_ties.htm">How does Ephesians 6:9 address the relationship between masters and slaves in a modern context?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_6_9_on_authority_equality.htm">What does Ephesians 6:9 reveal about God's view on authority and equality?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_6_9_s_impact_on_leaders_today.htm">How should Ephesians 6:9 influence Christian leadership in the workplace today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ephesians_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ephesians 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_in_the_gospel_of_the_hebrews.htm">What does the Bible say about societal hierarchy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_1_tim_6_1-2_not_condemn_slavery.htm">In 1 Timothy 6:1&#8211;2, why does the text address slaves in a way that seems to endorse their subjugation rather than condemn it? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_god_impartial_(rom_2_11_vs_exo_2_25).htm">Does God respect persons?

The parallel passage in the Colossian Epistle (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>) is the best comment on this, "Give unto your servants what is just and equal." "To forbear threatening," or, as in the original, "<span class= "ital">the</span> threatening," which is so common, is one example of this sense of sympathy. For threatening implies at every moment compulsion and coercion from a position of tyrannical superiority; dealing with the slave as one who has in him no free energy and no sense of duty, and who must be driven like a brute-beast, not led or guided as a man.<p><span class= "bld">Your Master also.</span>--The stronger marginal reading is perhaps better, <span class= "ital">their Master and yours.</span><p><span class= "bld">Respect of persons.</span>--In this phrase the word "person" is used in its original sense (still lingering in our modern use of "person" and "personal," for "body" and "bodily,") of the <span class= "ital">persona, i.e., </span>"the mask" of outward condition, circumstance, and privilege.

Thus in <a href="/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a>, <a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>, it is used of the distinction of privilege between Jew and Gentile, circumcision and uncircumcision; in <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>, of apostolic dignity in the eyes of men; in <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>; <a href="/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">James 2:9</a>, of distinction of social rank; here and in <a href="/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>, of the difference between the slave and the freeman. In the modern sense of "person," as signifying the real man, there is, and must be, "respect of persons" in all righteous judgment, whether of God or man. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening.</span> Act correspondingly toward your slaves, as if the eye of Christ were on you, which indeed it is; if you are ever tempted to grind them down, or defraud, or scold unreasonably and make their life bitter, remember that there is a Master above you, into whose ears their cry will come. If they are to do service to you as to the Lord, you are to require service of them as if you were the Lord. Therefore forbear threatening; influence them by love more than by fear. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing that both their and your Master is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.</span> Both of you stand in the same relation to the great Lord, who is in heaven and over all (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20, 21</a>). Your being higher in earthly station than they will not procure for you any indulgence or consideration. You will be judged simply and solely according to your deeds. Your responsibility to the Judge and your obligations to the Savior alike bind you to just and merciful treatment.
