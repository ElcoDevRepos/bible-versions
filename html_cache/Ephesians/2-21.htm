It reflects the Pauline theology that all spiritual blessings and unity are found in Jesus Christ. The phrase "In Him" is a recurring theme in Ephesians, highlighting the believer's union with Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>). This union is foundational for understanding the believer's identity and purpose.<p><b>the whole building</b><br>The metaphor of a building is used to describe the church, the body of believers. This imagery is consistent with other Pauline writings, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9-17</a>, where believers are described as God's building. The "whole building" signifies the universal church, composed of all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, unified in Christ.<p><b>is fitted together</b><br>This phrase suggests careful construction and design, indicating that each believer has a specific place and purpose within the church. The Greek term used here implies a harmonious joining, reflecting the idea that God is the master architect. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>, where believers are described as "living stones" being built into a spiritual house.<p><b>and grows</b><br>The growth of the building signifies the dynamic and living nature of the church. It is not static but continually expanding and maturing. This growth is both numerical, as more people come to faith, and spiritual, as believers deepen in their relationship with Christ. The idea of growth is also seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>, where the body of Christ is described as growing and building itself up in love.<p><b>into a holy temple</b><br>The temple imagery connects to the Old Testament, where the temple was the dwelling place of God among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). In the New Testament, the church is now the dwelling place of God through the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). The term "holy" emphasizes the set-apart nature of the church, called to reflect God's holiness.<p><b>in the Lord</b><br>This phrase reaffirms that the church's identity and growth are rooted in Christ. The Lordship of Christ is a central theme in Ephesians, underscoring His authority and preeminence over the church (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>).

Every spiritual blessing, identity, and purpose originates in a living union with Him (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p>- Practically, this reminds us that any growth or unity in the church starts when individuals are reconciled to God through faith in Jesus (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the whole building</b><p>- Paul shifts to a construction metaphor, picturing all believers&#8212;Jew and Gentile&#8212;as one comprehensive structure (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>).<p>- No stone is random or expendable; every member is part of God&#8217;s design (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>).<p>- This underscores the church&#8217;s universality: &#8220;the whole building&#8221; stretches across cultures, generations, and locations, yet is still one house (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is fitted together</b><p>- God Himself arranges each &#8220;living stone&#8221; so the fit is exact (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>).<p>- Unity is not achieved by human compromise but by divine craftsmanship.<p>- Whether our personalities clash or cultures differ, the Spirit aligns us so that we actually strengthen one another (<a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and grows</b><p>- The structure is not static; it &#8220;grows,&#8221; showing steady, organic increase (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>).<p>- Growth happens in both depth (spiritual maturity) and breadth (new believers added) as the gospel advances (<a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>).<p>- Genuine growth never contradicts biblical truth; instead, it springs from obedience to it (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into a holy temple</b><p>- The goal of this divine construction is a &#8220;holy temple,&#8221; a dwelling place for God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>).<p>- Holy means set apart.

Generally the best MSS. omit the article in the original. But the sense seems to demand the rendering of the text, unless, indeed, we adopt the only other possible rendering, "in whom every act of building"--that is, every addition to the building--"is bonded to the rest, and grows," &c. The clause agrees substantially, and almost verbally with <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>--"From whom the whole body, fitly joined (<span class= "ital">framed</span>) together and compacted . . . maketh increase of the body unto the edifying (<span class= "ital">building up</span>) of itself." In this latter passage the leading idea is of the<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom all the building.</span> Not even the figure of a building can keep the apostle from his favorite idea of vital fellowship with Christ as the soul of all Christianity - "in whom." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is rendered in R.V. "each several building." But surely the want of the article does not make imperative a rendering which is out of keeping with the apostle's object, viz. to illustrate the organic unity of believers, Jewish and Gentile, as one great body (comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, "There is one body"). If there had been many several or separate buildings in the apostle's view, why not a Jewish building and a Gentile building? Or how could the separate buildings have their lines directed by the one chief Cornerstone? In <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span> is not "every house of Israel," but "all the house of Israel." <span class="cmt_word">Fitly framed together.</span> There is a jointing and joining of the various parts to each other, forming a symmetrical, compact, well-ordered building. The Church has many members in one body, and all members have not the same office. It is a co-operative body, each aiding in his own way and with his own talent. The Church is not a collection of loose stones and timbers; its members are in vital union with Christ, and ought to be in living and loving and considerate fellowship with each other. <span class="cmt_word">Groweth into a holy temple in the Lord.</span> Increase is an essential property of the Church; wherever there is life there is growth. But the growth of the Church is not mere increase of members or size; the growth is <span class="accented">towards</span> a temple, of which the character is holy, and it is in the Lord. The world-famed temple of Diana at Ephesus may have been in the apostle's mind - its symmetry, its glory, the relation of each several part to the rest and to the whole, as a suitable external emblem of the spiritual body which is being built up in Christ; but the Christian Church is a <span class="accented">holy</span> temple, dedicated to God, purified by his Spirit, entirely foreign to those defilements which disgraced the temple of Diana. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> at the beginning of the verse is followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> at the end, as if the union of the Church to Christ could not be too often brought out.
