The "new self" refers to the regenerated nature that believers receive through faith in Christ. This concept is rooted in the idea of being "born again" (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>), where the old sinful nature is replaced by a new nature aligned with God's will. The imagery of "putting on" suggests a deliberate and conscious action, akin to changing clothes, symbolizing a complete change in identity and behavior. This transformation is not merely external but involves a deep, internal renewal of the mind and spirit (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>created to be like God</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the purpose of the new self, which is to reflect God's character. It echoes the creation narrative where humans were made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The fall of man marred this image, but through Christ, believers are restored to reflect God's attributes. This restoration process is ongoing and involves growing in Christlikeness, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>, where believers are transformed into the same image from glory to glory. The idea of being "created" suggests a divine act, emphasizing that this new nature is a work of God, not human effort.<p><b>in true righteousness and holiness</b><br>Righteousness and holiness are central attributes of God's character. "True righteousness" implies a standard that is genuine and not based on human definitions or self-righteousness. It involves living in a way that is just and upright, in accordance with God's laws and commands. Holiness, on the other hand, signifies being set apart for God's purposes, reflecting His purity and moral perfection. This dual emphasis on righteousness and holiness underscores the ethical and moral dimensions of the Christian life. It connects to other scriptures such as <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which calls believers to be holy as God is holy. This transformation into righteousness and holiness is made possible through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

In the "new man" here is implied not merely youthfulness, but the freshness of a higher nature (as in <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>). To "put on the new man" is, therefore, to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ," by that divine process of which we have the beginning in <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>, the continuation in <a href="/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>, and the completion in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-53.htm" title="For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.">1Corinthians 15:53-54</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2Corinthians 5:3</a>.

It describes the "purity of heart" of which our Lord Himself speaks as a still higher grace, gifted with a higher reward, than even "hunger and thirst after righteousness" (<a href="/matthew/5-6.htm" title="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.">Matthew 5:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>). "Righteousness" is goodness shown to others, to man and to God: "holiness" is goodness in itself, as it is in "the High and Holy One who inhabiteth eternity." Stress is laid upon it here in contrast with the lusts and uncleanness described above. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And put on the new man.</span> As the fruit of inward renewal, let there be outward renovation.

Some think" the new man" equivalent to "Christ" (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>), constituted the Head of renewed humanity, as Adam of depraved. But this would not correspond with the exhortation to put off the old man, nor should we be exhorted to put on Christ <span class="accented">after</span> being exhorted to be renewed in the spirit of our minds. In what sense, then, has the "new man" been created? The idea presented itself to the apostle <span class="accented">in the abstract - there</span> has been a creation of a new man; but concretely, we have to conform to the Divine creation, in respect of righteousness and holiness; righteousness denoting personal uprightness and fidelity to all social duties; holiness, the state of the spirit toward God. The last words, "of truth," denote the relation of righteousness and holiness to the truth. The words are opposed to "of deceit" in ver. 22. Lust is bred of deceit, but righteousness and holiness of truth. They never deceive, never disappoint, are solid to the end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to put on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(endysasthai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Middle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1746.htm">Strong's 1746: </a> </span><span class="str2">To put on, clothe (another).
