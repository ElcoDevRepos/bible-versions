This echoes the Shema from <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." It underscores the unity and universality of God, who is not just the God of Israel but of all humanity. This concept is foundational in understanding the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, a theme that runs throughout the Bible. The fatherhood of God also highlights His role as a loving and caring parent, which is a recurring theme in both the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>who is over all</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's sovereignty and supreme authority over the entire universe. It reflects the biblical teaching that God is the ultimate ruler and king, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>, "The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all." This sovereignty assures believers of God's control over all circumstances, providing comfort and assurance that nothing happens outside of His will. It also calls for submission and reverence to God's authority in all aspects of life.<p><b>and through all</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's active presence and involvement in the world. It suggests that God works through all things to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose." This indicates that God is not distant or detached but is intimately involved in the workings of the world and the lives of individuals. It also points to the idea of God's providence, where He orchestrates events for His glory and the good of His people.<p><b>and in all</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's omnipresence, the belief that God is present everywhere at all times. It aligns with <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>, where David acknowledges that there is no place he can go to escape God's presence. This truth provides believers with the assurance that God is always with them, offering guidance, comfort, and strength. It also challenges believers to live in a way that honors God's presence in every aspect of their lives, recognizing that they are never outside of His watchful care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

Remembering these truths dissolves divisions, fuels worship, and calls the church to walk together in humble, Spirit-filled harmony.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">One God and Father of all.</span>--Necessarily, through the Son, we pass to the Father (as the Lord Himself invariably teaches us to do), since He is (to use the old Greek expression) "the fount of Deity." He is said to be the "Father of all." We cannot limit this universal Fatherhood; although, undoubtedly, the context shows that the immediate reference is to those who are His children by adoption in Jesus Christ. The Church is essentially Catholic, inheriting by special gift what is the birthright of all humanity; incapable of perfection till all be drawn into that closer sonship, yet having neither right nor desire to deny that outside her pale at any moment the wider Fatherhood of God extends.<p><span class= "bld">Who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</span>--The word "you" has little authority; many MSS. and commentaries have "us." But the best MSS. and authorities omit both, as probably early glosses of explanation which have crept into the text. Accordingly, the word "all" throughout must be taken, as above, as applying to all God's rational creatures, made in His image (and indeed, in a lower sense, even to all His creatures), but especially and properly to the members of Christ's Church. In the three-fold sentence many ancient and modern interpreters trace a reference to the Holy Trinity. But, strictly speaking, this cannot be, as the passage expressly points to the Father; although, in virtue of the eternal unity of the Godhead, it may be true that in the expression "through all" and "in all" we trace those manifestations of the Father which are especially made through the Son and by the Holy Spirit. Hence we must refer all properly to the ultimate conception of God the Father; as "above all" in the sovereignty of His will, since to work out "His pleasure they are and were created," and His will becomes to them the "law eternal;" as "through all" in the diffusive power of the forces--physical, moral, and spiritual--by which the world of nature, still more the world of man, most of all the society of Christians, are swayed as wholes; and "in all" by the indwelling of God in the individual for creation, sustentation, regeneration, which is the breath of life--both the physical and spiritual life. (This individuality, and the especial reference to Christians, are marked by the very natural gloss "us," or "you," in this clause.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
