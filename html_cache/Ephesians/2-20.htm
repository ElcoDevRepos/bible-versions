The apostles, chosen by Jesus, were eyewitnesses to His resurrection and were tasked with spreading His teachings. The prophets, both from the Old Testament and those in the early Church, provided divine revelation and guidance. This foundation signifies the continuity and fulfillment of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The apostles and prophets laid the doctrinal and spiritual groundwork for the Church, ensuring that it was rooted in truth and divine revelation. This foundation is not merely historical but is living and active, as the teachings and revelations continue to guide the Church today.<p><b>with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone</b><br>In ancient architecture, the cornerstone was the principal stone, often the largest and most stable, upon which the rest of the structure depended. This metaphor highlights Christ's preeminent role in the Church. As the cornerstone, Jesus is the essential support and unifying element of the Church, ensuring its stability and alignment. This imagery is rooted in Old Testament prophecy, such as <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, which speaks of a precious cornerstone laid by God. In the New Testament, Jesus is frequently identified as this cornerstone (e.g., <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-7</a>), fulfilling the messianic prophecies and establishing the Church's foundation.

The metaphor itself, of the Church as "a building of God"--frequently used in the New Testament--reaches its full perfection in this passage. (1) It starts, of course, from the words of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>), "On this rock I will build my Church;" but in the use of it sometimes the prominent idea is of the growth by addition of individual stones, sometimes of the complex unity of the building as a whole. (2) The former idea naturally occurs first, connecting itself, indeed, with the still more personal application of the metaphor to the "edification" of the individual to be a temple of God (found, for example, in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1Thessalonians 5:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1Corinthians 10:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2Corinthians 10:8</a>). Thus in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm" title="For we are laborers together with God: you are God's husbandry, you are God's building.">1Corinthians 3:9</a>, from "ye are God's building," St. Paul passes at once to the building of individual character on the one foundation; in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1Corinthians 14:26</a>, the edification of the Church has reference to the effect of prophecy on individual souls; in <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>, the emphasis is still on the building up of "living stones" upon "a living stone." (Comp. <a href="/acts/20-32.htm" title="And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.">Acts 20:32</a>.) (3) In this Epistle the other idea--the idea of unity--is always prominent, though not exclusive of the other (as here and in <a href="/context/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>). But that this conception of unity is less absolute than that conveyed by the metaphor of the body will be seen by noting that it differs from it in three respects; first, that it carries with it the notion of a more distinct individuality in each stone; next, that it conveys (as in the "graffing in" of <a href="/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a>) the idea of continual growth by accretion of individual souls drawn to Christ; lastly, that it depicts the Church as having more completely a distinct, though not a separate, existence from Him who dwells in it. (On this last point compare the metaphor of the spouse of Christ in <a href="/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>.) Hence it is naturally worked out with greater completeness in an Epistle which has so especially for its object the evolution of the doctrine of "the one Holy Catholic Church." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.</span> A new figure, the third here introduced to denote the change - that of a temple, of which Christians are stones. There is no contrast in form in this figure, as in the other two; it just expresses directly the privilege attained. There is a real contrast, however, between the first three and the last three verses of the chapter - the lowest degradation expressed in the one, the highest elevation in the ether. Observe, the apostle passes, by association of ideas, from the household (ver. 19) to the house (ver. 20), from the domestics to the stones; but by a bold figure he gives life to the stones, otherwise we might be in the same region of lifelessness as in yore. 1-3. Two questions arise here. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> About this foundation - In what sense is it "of the apostles and prophets"? Certainly not in the sense that they <span class="accented">constituted</span> the foundation; for, though this might be warranted grammatically, it would be untrue: "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>). The best meaning seems to be, the foundation which the apostles and prophets laid, which they used for themselves and announced for others. But what was this foundation? Substantially that of <a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>; but the mention of Christ as chief Corner-stone at the end of the verse might at first seem to indicate that something different was meant by the foundation. But it is impossible to propose any suitable interpretation which would not make Christ the Foundation too. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Who are the prophets? We might naturally suppose the Old Testament prophets, but in that case they would probably have been mentioned before the apostles. In other passages of this Epistle "apostles and prophets" denote New Testament officers (<a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>), and it is most suitable to regard that as the meaning. It was the privilege of the Ephesians to use the foundation on which stood the two highest bodies of officers in the new dispensation - the apostles and prophets; nothing better could be found. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ himself being the chief Cornerstone.</span> Not as opposed to the foundation, but in addition thereto. Jesus is really both, but there is a reason for specifying him as the chief Cornerstone; comp. <a href="/psalms/118-21.htm">Psalm 118:21</a>, "The stone which the builders rejected is become the headstone of the corner;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the stone which, being placed in the corner, determined the lines of the whole building. The idea of foundation is that of support; the idea of the chief cornerstone is that of regulation, pattern-hood, producing assimilation. Jesus is not only the Origin, Foundation, Support of the Church, but he gives it its shape and form, he determines the place and the office of each stone, he gives life and character to each member. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">built</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(epoikodom&#275;thentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2026.htm">Strong's 2026: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build upon (above) a foundation.
