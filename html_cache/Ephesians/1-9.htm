The "mystery" refers to truths that were once concealed but are now revealed through Christ. In biblical context, a mystery is not something unknowable but something once hidden and now revealed by God. This aligns with <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>, where Paul speaks of the mystery hidden for ages but now revealed to the saints. The mystery involves the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant, a radical shift from the Jewish-centric view of God's promises.<p><b>according to His good pleasure</b><br>This indicates that the revelation of His will is not due to human merit but is a result of God's sovereign and gracious choice. It reflects God's benevolent nature and His desire to share His plans with humanity. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>, where it is stated that God works in believers to will and to act according to His good purpose. The phrase underscores the grace and kindness of God in revealing His plans to us.<p><b>which He purposed in Christ</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that God's plan is centered in Christ. The purpose of God is fulfilled and realized in Jesus, who is the focal point of God's redemptive work. This connects to <a href="/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a>, which speaks of the eternal purpose accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. Theologically, it underscores the centrality of Christ in God's plan of salvation, highlighting that all things are brought together under Christ. This also reflects the typology of Christ as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and promises, serving as the ultimate revelation of God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_ephesus.htm">The Church in Ephesus</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Ephesian church was a significant early Christian community located in a major city of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the passage, Christ is the one in whom God's will is purposed and revealed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who reveals the mystery of His will, acting according to His good pleasure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_of_god's_will.htm">The Mystery of God's Will</a></b><br>Refers to the divine plan of salvation and unity in Christ, previously hidden but now revealed to believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_will.htm">Understanding God's Will</a></b><br>God's will is not meant to be a secret forever; it is revealed to us through Christ.<br><br>Believers are invited to seek and understand God's will as part of their spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_christ_in_revelation.htm">The Role of Christ in Revelation</a></b><br>Christ is central to the revelation of God's will, emphasizing the importance of a Christ-centered faith.<br><br>Our understanding of God's plan is deepened through our relationship with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_according_to_god's_good_pleasure.htm">Living According to God's Good Pleasure</a></b><br>God's will is aligned with His good pleasure, suggesting that His plans for us are rooted in His love and goodness.<br><br>We are called to trust in God's purposes, even when they are not fully understood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The mystery of God's will involves bringing all things together under Christ, promoting unity among believers.<br><br>As part of the body of Christ, we should strive for unity and peace within the church.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_1_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 1:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_1_9_God_s_purpose_today.htm">How does Ephesians 1:9 reveal God's purpose for our lives today?

The word "mystery" properly signifies a thing which (see <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>) "was hid from all ages, but is now made manifest."

The ordinary sense of the word "mystery"--a thing of which we know that it is, though how it is we know not--is not implied in the original meaning of the word; but it is a natural derivative from it. Reason can apprehend, when revealed, that which it cannot discover; but seldom or never can it comprehend it perfectly. In this verse the mystery is declared to be accordant to the good pleasure of God's will, which (it is added) "He purposed <span class= "ital">in Himself."</span> In this seems to be implied that (see <a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>) though in some sense we can know it, yet in its fulness "it passeth knowledge." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having made known unto us the mystery of his will</span>.
