The "riches of His glory" suggests the vastness and sufficiency of God's resources, which are available to believers. This concept is echoed in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where Paul speaks of God supplying every need according to His riches in glory. The glory of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, often associated with His majesty, holiness, and the manifestation of His presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a> when Moses asks to see God's glory.<p><b>He may strengthen you with power</b><br>The request for strength and power indicates the need for divine enablement in the believer's life. This power is not of human origin but is a supernatural empowerment that comes from God. In <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, Jesus promises the disciples that they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them, signifying the transformative and empowering work of the Spirit. The strength mentioned here is necessary for living a life that reflects Christ and for enduring trials and challenges.<p><b>through His Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit is the agent of this empowerment, emphasizing the role of the Spirit in the believer's life. The Spirit's work is essential for spiritual growth, understanding, and the ability to live out the Christian faith. In <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, Jesus describes the Holy Spirit as the Helper who will be with believers forever, guiding them into all truth. The indwelling of the Spirit is a mark of the New Covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people.<p><b>in your inner being</b><br>The focus on the "inner being" underscores the importance of inner transformation rather than mere external conformity. This inner renewal is a theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are urged to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. The inner being refers to the heart, mind, and soul, the core of a person's identity and spiritual life. This transformation is necessary for developing Christ-like character and for experiencing the fullness of life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple to Artemis and a significant early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who empowers and strengthens believers in their spiritual lives.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inner_being.htm">The Inner Being</a></b><br>Refers to the spiritual aspect of a person, the heart or soul, where transformation and strengthening by the Holy Spirit occur.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_riches_of_his_glory.htm">The Riches of His Glory</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the abundant and infinite resources of God's majesty and power available to believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_strength.htm">The Source of Strength</a></b><br>Recognize that true spiritual strength comes from God&#8217;s glorious riches, not from our own efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Understand that the Holy Spirit is the agent of empowerment in our lives, working within us to transform and strengthen.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_the_inner_being.htm">Focus on the Inner Being</a></b><br>Prioritize spiritual growth and inner transformation over external appearances or achievements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_empowerment.htm">Prayer for Empowerment</a></b><br>Regularly pray for God&#8217;s strength and power to be manifest in your life, acknowledging your dependence on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_god's_power.htm">Living in God&#8217;s Power</a></b><br>Apply the strength received from God to face daily challenges, temptations, and opportunities for service.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_3_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_gain_daily_strength_from_the_Spirit.htm">How can we be "strengthened with power" through the Holy Spirit daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_inner_being_in_Eph_3_16.htm">What does "inner being" mean in the context of Ephesians 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Eph_3_16_Phil_4_13_Strength_in_Christ.htm">How does Ephesians 3:16 connect with Philippians 4:13 about strength in Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_Spirit_s_power_in_weakness.htm">In what ways can we seek the Spirit's power in our weaknesses?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Eph_3_16_guide_prayers_for_others.htm">How can Ephesians 3:16 guide our prayers for spiritual strength for others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_Holy_Spirit_in_Eph_3_16.htm">How does Ephesians 3:16 define the role of the Holy Spirit in strengthening believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Paul_s_message_in_Eph_3_16.htm">What historical context influenced Paul's message in Ephesians 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_3_16_and_inner_strength.htm">How does Ephesians 3:16 relate to the concept of inner spiritual strength?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ephesians_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ephesians 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_join_a_guided_christian_prayer.htm">What are the riches of God's glory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_original_sin_tied_to_jesus'_death.htm">What insights does Day 34 offer on spiritual growth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_holy_spirit's_patience.htm">What is the patience of the Holy Spirit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'christ_lives_in_me'_signify.htm">What does "Christ Lives in Me" signify?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ephesians 3:16 Mean</div><b>I ask that</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words drip with humble dependence.

His prayer here, as in <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>, is for the gift of the Spirit, but under some difference of aspect. There the prayer is for illumination, here for strength to grasp the mystery, to be rooted in love, and be filled up to the fulness of God. Accordingly, there the inner man is represented only by the "eyes of the heart;" here (as in <a href="/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>) we hear of the "inner man" in his entirety, including all faculties--intellectual, emotional, moral--which make up his spiritual nature. And St. Paul emphasises this prayer very strikingly by asking that the gift may be "according to the riches of His glory," unlimited as the illimitable glory of the Divine Nature itself. Moreover, a greater closeness of communion is clearly indicated here. For light is a gift from without; strength comes from an indwelling power, making itself perfect in weakness, and continually growing from grace to grace.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory.</span> The standard or measure of the Divine giving is brought into view. "Riches of his glory" is a more emphatic expression than "glorious riches," though substantially the same in meaning. God's standard of giving is liberal, bountiful, overflowing. An image of the riches of his glory is seen in the starry heavens, which proclaim at once the vast riches and surpassing glory of God. Or in the beautiful appearance of an autumn sunset, where the whole sky is flecked with clouds brightened into a sea of glory. In prayer, it is both useful for ourselves and glorifying to God to recognize his bountifulness - to remember that he gives us a King (<a href="/2_samuel/24-23.htm">2 Samuel 24:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.</span> The inner man is the seat of influence, but with us it is the scat of spiritual feebleness. Most men may contrive to order their outward conduct suitably; but who has control of the inner man? Faith, trust, humility, love, patience, and the like graces which belong to the inner man, are what we are weakest in, and what we have least power to make strong. In this very region it is sought that the Ephesians might be strengthened with might by the Spirit. The gift of the Spirit is available for this very purpose for all that ask him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ I pray ] that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
