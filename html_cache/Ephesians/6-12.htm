The term "flesh and blood" is a common biblical idiom for humanity (<a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>). The struggle is spiritual, indicating that believers must focus on spiritual disciplines and the power of God rather than human strength or wisdom. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-4</a>, which speaks of spiritual warfare using divine power.<p><b>but against the rulers</b><br>The "rulers" refer to spiritual entities with authority in the unseen realm. These are not earthly rulers but spiritual beings that exert influence over the world. This concept is echoed in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, where Paul speaks of thrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities created through and for Christ, indicating a hierarchy in the spiritual realm.<p><b>against the authorities</b><br>"Authorities" suggests a structured hierarchy of evil spiritual forces. This term implies a level of organization and power that these entities hold. In the context of the Roman Empire, authority was a well-understood concept, and Paul uses this to illustrate the organized nature of spiritual opposition. This is further supported by <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, where a spiritual prince opposes an angelic messenger.<p><b>against the powers of this world&#8217;s darkness</b><br>This phrase highlights the pervasive influence of evil in the world. "World's darkness" suggests a moral and spiritual blindness that pervades human society. <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a> speaks of people loving darkness rather than light, indicating a preference for sin. The "powers" are those that perpetuate this darkness, opposing the light of Christ.<p><b>and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms</b><br>The "spiritual forces of evil" are demonic entities operating in the "heavenly realms," which refers to the spiritual dimension. This suggests that the battle is not only earthly but also cosmic. <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a> describes the "prince of the power of the air," indicating a spiritual realm where these forces operate. The "heavenly realms" also remind believers of their position in Christ, as <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a> states that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in these realms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located.

In <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50</a>, we have "flesh and blood." The sense is clearly, as the comparison of all these passages shows, "mere human power." Possibly the word "blood" is here put first to prevent even a moment's confusion with the idea of wrestling against "the flesh" as an evil power within ourselves. In many passages of this Epistle St. Paul had dwelt on the opposition of the Christian to the heathen life, and the duty of rebuking and putting to shame the works of darkness; but here he warns us that the struggle is not a struggle with the "flesh and blood" of wicked men--a struggle which may still admit of some reserve of sympathy--but a truceless war with the spiritual powers of evil themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Against principalities, against powers.</span>--See Note on <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood.</span> Our conflict is not with <span class="accented">men</span>, here denoted by "flesh and blood," which is usually a symbol of weakness, therefore denoting that our opponents are not weak mortals, but powers of a far more formidable order. <span class="cmt_word">But against the principalities, against the powers.</span> The same words as in <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; therefore the definite article is prefixed, as denoting what we are already familiar with: for though all of these, evil as well as good, have been put under Christ the Head, they have not been put under the members, but the evil among them are warring against these members with all the greater ferocity that they cannot assail the Head. <span class="cmt_word">Against the world-rulers of this [state of] darkness</span> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>). "World-rulers" denotes the extent of the dominion of these invisible foes - the term is applied only to the rulers of the most widely extended tracts; there is no part of the globe to which their influence does not extend, and where their dark rule does not show itself (comp. <a href="/luke/4-6.htm">Luke 4:6</a>). "This darkness" expressively denotes the element and the results of their rule. Observe contrast with Christ's servants, who are children of light, equivalent to order, knowledge, purity, joy, peace, etc.; while the element of the devil and his servants is darkness, equivalent to confusion, ignorance, crime, terror, strife, and all misery. <span class="cmt_word">Against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.</span> The natural meaning, though questioned by some, is, either that these hosts of wickedness have their residence in heavenly places, or, that these places are the scene of our conflict with them. The latter seems more agreeable to the context, for "in heavenly places" does not denote a geographical locality here any more than in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a> and Ephesians 2:6. When it is said that "we have been seated with Christ in heavenly places," the allusion is to the spiritual experience of his people; in spirit they are at the gate of heaven, where their hearts are full of heavenly thoughts and feelings; the statement now before us is that, even in such places, amid their most fervent experiences or their most sublime services, they are subject to the attacks of the spirits of wickedness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/6-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;min)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
