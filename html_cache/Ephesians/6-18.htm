In the biblical context, praying in the Spirit means aligning one's prayers with the will and guidance of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26-27</a>, where the Spirit intercedes for believers. The early church, as described in Acts, often relied on the Spirit for direction and empowerment. This continuous prayer reflects a life of constant communion with God, akin to <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, which encourages believers to "pray without ceasing."<p><b>With every kind of prayer and petition</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the variety and depth of prayer. It includes adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication. The use of "every kind" suggests that prayer should be comprehensive, covering all aspects of life and needs. <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> echoes this by urging believers to present their requests to God in every situation. Historically, Jewish prayer practices included various forms, such as the Shema and the Amidah, which were integral to daily life.<p><b>To this end, stay alert</b><br>Staying alert in prayer implies vigilance and watchfulness, akin to Jesus' instruction to His disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>). This vigilance is necessary to recognize spiritual battles and the needs of others. The cultural context of the early church involved constant threats and persecution, requiring believers to be spiritually awake and discerning.<p><b>With all perseverance</b><br>Perseverance in prayer is a call to steadfastness and endurance, even when answers are delayed or challenges arise. This echoes the parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, where Jesus teaches the importance of persistent prayer. The historical context of Ephesians, written during Paul's imprisonment, underscores the need for perseverance amidst trials.<p><b>In your prayers for all the saints</b><br>This phrase emphasizes intercessory prayer for fellow believers. The term "saints" refers to all Christians, highlighting the communal aspect of faith. Intercession is a key theme throughout Scripture, as seen in the prayers of Moses, Daniel, and Jesus Himself (John 17). The early church's practice of praying for one another, as seen in <a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>, reflects the unity and mutual support within the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to encourage and instruct the early Christian church in Ephesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse culture and the Temple of Artemis.

See the hymn- <p><span class="accented">"Go, when the morning shineth;<br />Go, when the noon is bright;<br />Go, when the day declineth;<br />Go, in the hush of night."</span> <span class="cmt_word">In the Spirit</span>; for true prayer is spiritual, and it is not true prayer unless by the Holy Spirit the heart is filled with heavenward longings and aspirations, changing our prayer from cold form to heartfelt realities. The ordinary habit of the soul should be prayerful, realizing the presence of God and looking for his grace and guidance. <span class="cmt_word">And watching thereunto</span>; that is, "towards" spirituality, against formality, as also against forgetfulness and neglect of prayer. Perhaps also the idea of watching <span class="accented">for the answer</span> is involved, as you wait for an answer when you have dispatched a letter. <span class="cmt_word">In all perseverance</span>; this being very specially needed to make prayer triumphant, as in the case of the Syro-phoenician mother, or in that of Monica, mother of Augustine, and many more. <span class="cmt_word">And prayer for all saints</span>; this being one of the great objects for which saints are gathered into the "one body" the Church, that they may be upheld and carried on, in warfare and in work, by mutual prayer, kept from slips and infirmities, and from deadly sins, and enabled one and all to "walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/6-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Pray</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(proseuchomenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4336.htm">Strong's 4336: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pray, pray for, offer prayer.
