In Ephesians, Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to previous generations (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-5</a>). The "gospel" refers to the good news of Jesus Christ's death, resurrection, and the salvation it brings. This mystery was revealed to Paul by divine revelation (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>), emphasizing the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>the Gentiles are fellow heirs</b><br>In the Old Testament, the promises of God were primarily directed towards Israel. However, through Christ, Gentiles are now included as "fellow heirs" (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). This inclusion fulfills the Abrahamic promise that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The concept of inheritance in biblical times was significant, often involving land, status, and family lineage, which now extends to spiritual inheritance in God's kingdom.<p><b>fellow members of the body</b><br>The "body" refers to the Church, the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-13</a>). This phrase emphasizes unity and equality among believers, regardless of ethnic or cultural background. In the early church, this was a radical concept, as Jews and Gentiles were historically divided. The unity of believers as one body in Christ is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>).<p><b>and fellow partakers of the promise</b><br>The "promise" likely refers to the Holy Spirit and eternal life, as well as the blessings of the New Covenant (<a href="/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>). This promise was once thought to be exclusive to Israel but is now available to all who believe in Christ. The inclusion of Gentiles as partakers signifies the breaking down of barriers and the universal scope of God's salvation plan.<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b><br>The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is central to Paul's theology, indicating the believer's union with Christ. This union is the basis for all spiritual blessings and the new identity of believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). It underscores that the mystery, inheritance, and promises are realized through a relationship with Jesus, who is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the mediator of the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who, through the gospel, are now included in the promises of God alongside the Jewish people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the church to whom this letter was addressed was located.

Paul is highlighting something God once kept hidden but has now unveiled. Scripture consistently uses &#8220;mystery&#8221; for truths concealed until God&#8217;s chosen moment of revelation (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26&#8211;27</a>; <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25&#8211;26</a>). The point: what follows is not human speculation but a divine disclosure, authenticated by the prophetic Scriptures and made plain in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Through the gospel</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220; &#8230; that through the gospel &#8230;&#8221;. All of God&#8217;s saving purposes converge in the good news of Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1&#8211;4</a>). Only by believing this message do people&#8212;Jew or Gentile&#8212;enter God&#8217;s family (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34&#8211;43</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>). Human merit, ethnic background, or ritual cannot add or subtract from what Christ finished (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Gentiles</b><p>Paul specifies that &#8220;the Gentiles&#8221; are included. Gentiles&#8212;those once &#8220;without hope and without God in the world&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>)&#8212;had been promised blessing as far back as <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.

God&#8217;s plan always embraced every tribe and tongue, and the gospel makes that inclusion unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fellow heirs</b><p>The first benefit: &#8220;fellow heirs.&#8221; Believing Gentiles inherit everything promised to God&#8217;s people&#8212;eternal life, the indwelling Spirit, and a future in Christ&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>). No second-class status exists; all who are in Christ share equally in the full inheritance reserved in heaven (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fellow members of the body</b><p>Next, Paul says Gentiles are &#8220;fellow members of the body.&#8221; There is one body, the church, with Christ as Head (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22&#8211;23</a>). Jews and Gentiles are joined together, reconciled &#8220;in one body to God through the cross&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; see also <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). Unity is not organizational but spiritual, created by the Holy Spirit at conversion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus</b><p>Finally, Gentiles are &#8220;fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The promise includes the Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>), forgiveness of sins (<a href="/acts/10-43.htm">Acts 10:43</a>), and every covenant blessing summed up in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). Participation happens &#8220;in Christ Jesus,&#8221; underlining that union with Him&#8212;not ancestry&#8212;secures every promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a> reveals God&#8217;s once-hidden plan: the same gospel that saves Jews equally saves Gentiles, granting them the very inheritance, body membership, and covenant promises found in Christ. God&#8217;s family is one, built on faith in the finished work of Jesus, displaying His wisdom and grace to the world and to the heavenly realms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">are fellow-heirs, </span>admitted already fully in God's councils, as partially in actual fact to the kingdom of God.<p><span class= "bld">And of the same body, and </span>[<span class= "ital">fellow-</span>]<span class= "bld"> partakers of his promise.</span>--These three words (of which the last two are peculiar to this Epistle) evidently describe progressive steps in the work of salvation. First comes the acceptance by God to a share in the inheritance, as "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>); next, incorporation into the mystical body of Christ; lastly, the actual enjoyment of a share in the promise--that is, all the spiritual blessings of the covenant, called "promises" because, though real in themselves, they are only an earnest of the hereafter. At every point stress is laid on their fellowship with Israel in all these gifts. The shoots of the wild olive (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a>) are first chosen out, then "grafted in," and lastly "partake with the natural branches of the root and fatness of the olive tree."<p><span class= "bld">In Christ by the gospel.</span>--These words should be joined with all the three preceding. Of all the privileges of the new life, the being "in Christ" is the substance, the reception of the gospel in faith the instrument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs</span> - heirs with the Jews of the same inheritance (see <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and fellow-members of the body</span> (this figure is repeated and applied in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4, 16, 25</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel</span> - the promise to Abraham, "In thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed." They do not get this blessing indirectly through the Jews, or by becoming Jews, but directly, as Gentiles; and they become fellow-heirs, fellow-members, and fellow-partakers "in Christ Jesus," enjoying all privileges in him, in a state of union and fellowship with him. To this state they are invited and admitted <span class="accented">through the gospel</span>; by receiving the glad tidings they enter on these blessings (comp. <a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15, 18</a>). This statement of religious equality between Jews and Gentiles is strong, clear, complete; the more remarkable that Paul himself had bad so strong Jewish prejudices; only one of dearest insight and highest courage could proclaim the truth so emphatically; it is little wonder if many believing Jews, less enlightened and less courageous, shrank from his statements as too strong. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[This mystery is that] through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
