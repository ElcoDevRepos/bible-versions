In the biblical context, God's power is often demonstrated through creation, miracles, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Greek word for "power" here is "dynamis," which implies inherent strength and ability. This power surpasses human understanding and is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>, which speaks of God's infinite understanding and power. The surpassing greatness of God's power is also a reminder of His sovereignty and omnipotence, as seen in the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6).<p><b>to us who believe</b><br>This power is directed towards believers, indicating a personal and relational aspect of God's might. Belief, or faith, is a central tenet of Christianity, as highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. The power available to believers is not just theoretical but practical, enabling them to live out their faith and overcome spiritual challenges. This is further illustrated in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul declares that he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. The power is not earned but is a gift of grace, accessible through faith in Jesus Christ.<p><b>These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength</b><br>This phrase connects God's power to His active involvement in the world. The "working" (Greek: "energeia") suggests an operative and effective power, not dormant or passive. God's mighty strength is evident throughout biblical history, from the creation narrative in Genesis to the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels. The term "mighty strength" underscores God's ability to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives strength to the weary. This strength is also a type of Christ, who embodies God's power and authority, as demonstrated in His resurrection and ascension, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple to Artemis and a significant early Christian community.

St. Paul, therefore, adds that this power of God is not latent; it actually works "according to," that is, up to the full measure of "the might of the strength" of God--of that strength which is a part of His nature. The whole phrase forms a glorious climax, in which the Apostle accumulates words ever stronger and stronger to approach to the description of the omnipotence of the Spirit. It is a "force of exceeding greatness;" it is an ever energetic force; its only measure is the immeasurable might of the divine nature.
