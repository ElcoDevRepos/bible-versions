The concept of illumination suggests bringing light to something previously obscured. In biblical terms, light often symbolizes truth and understanding (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). Paul's role as an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>) underscores the inclusivity of the gospel message, breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>the stewardship of this mystery</b><br>The term "stewardship" refers to the responsibility of managing or overseeing something. In this context, Paul is entrusted with the responsibility of revealing God's plan. The "mystery" pertains to the previously hidden truth that Gentiles are fellow heirs in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). This concept of mystery is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, indicating divine truths revealed at the appointed time (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).<p><b>which for ages past was kept hidden in God</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine timing and sovereignty in the revelation of God's plan. The mystery was concealed in God's wisdom until the appropriate time (<a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-26</a>). The idea of something being hidden in God suggests His omniscience and the unfolding of His redemptive plan throughout history. This aligns with the biblical narrative of progressive revelation, where God's purposes are gradually disclosed (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><b>who created all things</b><br>This statement affirms God's role as the Creator, establishing His authority and power over all creation (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>). It underscores the idea that the same God who orchestrated the universe is the one revealing this mystery. The reference to creation also connects to the new creation in Christ, where believers are made new (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This ties into the broader biblical theme of redemption and restoration through Jesus Christ, the agent of creation (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to explain the mystery of the Gospel and his role in revealing it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple to Artemis and a significant early Christian community.

Yet it is weaker, for while we can enlighten, it is our daily sorrow that we cannot "make men see." Even He wept over Jerusalem because His light was, by wilful blindness, "hidden from their eyes" (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>).

This is no trifling matter; it connects itself with God's grandest operations; it has supremely glorious bearings. It might be supposed to have relations only to one race and to one period of time; but it has relations to "all things;" it is an integral element in God's plan.
