The term "walk" is often used in Scripture to denote one's way of life or conduct (e.g., <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>). It implies a habitual pattern of behavior. The Ephesians, like all believers, were once living in sin, following the desires of the flesh and mind (<a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>). This transformation from their former way of life to a new life in Christ is a central theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing the radical change that occurs through salvation (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>when you conformed to the ways of this world</b><br>The "ways of this world" refers to the secular, ungodly systems and values that are opposed to God's will. In biblical context, "world" often signifies the fallen, sinful state of humanity and its rebellion against God (1 <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>). The Ephesians, prior to their conversion, lived according to these worldly standards, which are characterized by self-centeredness and moral corruption. This conformity to the world is contrasted with the call to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>and of the ruler of the power of the air</b><br>This phrase identifies Satan as the "ruler" or "prince" of the power of the air. In Jewish and early Christian thought, the air was considered the realm of demonic spirits. Satan is depicted as having authority over this domain, influencing the world and its systems (<a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). This highlights the spiritual warfare that believers are engaged in, as they are called to resist the devil and his schemes (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience</b><br>The "spirit" here refers to the pervasive influence of Satan and his demonic forces, actively working in those who are disobedient to God. "Sons of disobedience" is a Hebraic expression indicating those who are characterized by rebellion against God (<a href="/colossians/3-6.htm">Colossians 3:6</a>). This underscores the reality of spiritual blindness and bondage to sin that affects all humanity apart from Christ. The ongoing work of this spirit contrasts with the work of the Holy Spirit in believers, who leads them into truth and righteousness (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus, providing theological insights and practical guidance for Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple to Artemis and a hub of early Christian activity.

Remembering this past heightens gratitude for God&#8217;s saving grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>) and fuels resolve to live distinctly, resist worldly pressures, and shine the light that frees others from the ruler of the air.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The course</span> (or, <span class= "ital">age</span>) <span class= "bld">of this world.</span>--Here again are united the two words often rendered by "world," the former signifying simply "the age," or appointed period of this visible universe, the latter its material and sensuous character. When we are warned against the one (as in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>, "Be not conformed to this world;" see also <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2Timothy 4:10</a>), it is against the" vanity"--that is, the transitoriness and unreality--of the present life; when against the other (see <a href="/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8-10</a>), it is against its "pomp," its carnal, material, unspiritual splendour. Here the former life of the Ephesians is described as at once transitory and carnal. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein aforetime ye walked according to the course of this world.</span> The idea of a dead creature walking is not altogether incongruous. It implies that a kind of life remained sufficient for walking; but not the true, full, normal life; rather the life of a galvanized corpse, or of one walking in sleep. The figurative use of <span class="accented">walking</span> for living, or carrying on our life, is frequent in this Epistle (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, etc.). "The course of this world," elsewhere" the world," denotes the present system of things, as conducted by those who have regard only to things seen and temporal, and no regard to God or to the future life. Where there is spiritual death there is insensibility to these things. <span class="cmt_word">According to the prince of the power of the air.</span> It is obvious that this is equivalent to "the god of this world" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), but the explanation of the term is difficult. Allusion is made to a corporate body, "the power [or, 'government'] (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) of the air," and to one who is "prince" of this government. There is no difficulty in identifying the evil one and his host, of whom Milton gives such graphic pictures. But why should they be specially connected with the <span class="accented">air?</span> The notion, entertained by some of the Fathers and others, that storms and disturbances of the atmosphere are caused by them, is preposterous; it is unscriptural (<a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>) and quite unscientific. The term seems to denote that evil spirits, who have some power of influencing us by their temptations, have their abode in the atmosphere, or at least haunt it, being invisible like it, yet exercising a real influence on human souls, and drawing them in worldly directions, and contrary to the will of God. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit which is now working hi the sons of disobedience.</span> The fact that this spirit is still working in others makes the escape of the Ephesians from him the more striking. He is not destroyed, but vigorously at work even yet. Though Jesus beheld him fall from heaven as lightning, and though he said that the prince of this world had been judged, these expressions denote a prophetic rather than an actual condition. This spirit energizes in the "sons of disobedience." This designation is striking; it denotes persons born of disobedience, bred by disobedience, having disobedience in their very nature; comp. <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>, "The carnal mind is enmity against God," and passages where fallen man is called a rebel (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a>, etc.). It denotes the essential antagonism of man's will to God's, arising from man's devotion to this world and its interests, and God's regard to what is higher and holier - an antagonism often held in check and suppressed - but bursting out wildly at times in fierce opposition, as at the tower of Babel or the crucifixion of Jesus. The devil inflames man's inherent dislike to God's will, and encourages outbreaks of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
