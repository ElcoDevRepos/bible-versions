Literally, Paul was under house arrest in Rome (<a href="/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16-31</a>), a situation that underscores his commitment to the Gospel despite personal cost. Metaphorically, being a "prisoner in the Lord" signifies total submission to Christ's will, reflecting the idea that true freedom is found in servitude to God (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>). This phrase sets the tone for the exhortation that follows, emphasizing the authority and sincerity of Paul's message.<p><b>I urge you</b><br>The Greek word for "urge" (parakaleo) conveys a sense of earnest appeal and encouragement. Paul is not commanding but strongly encouraging the Ephesians to live out their faith. This reflects the pastoral heart of Paul, who desires the spiritual growth and maturity of the believers. It is a call to action, rooted in love and concern for their spiritual well-being.<p><b>to walk in a manner worthy</b><br>"Walk" is a common biblical metaphor for one's conduct or lifestyle (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>). To walk "worthy" means to live in a way that reflects the value and significance of the calling they have received. This involves aligning one's life with the teachings and example of Christ, demonstrating integrity, humility, and love. The concept of worthiness is not about earning God's favor but responding appropriately to the grace already given.<p><b>of the calling you have received:</b><br>The "calling" refers to the divine invitation to salvation and a life of holiness (<a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). It encompasses both the individual and collective purpose of believers, which is to glorify God and advance His kingdom. This calling is rooted in God's eternal plan and is a theme throughout Ephesians, highlighting the unity and purpose of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18, 4</a>:4). The phrase emphasizes the responsibility of believers to live in accordance with their identity in Christ, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing from prison.

These last most of all depend on the "fellow-working" of man--primarily in the soul receiving them, and secondarily in all who can influence it for good and for evil.<p>We have here a perfect and exhaustive exposition of the unity of the Church, on which depend the other qualities of "Holiness," "Catholicity," and "Apostolicity" ascribed to it in the Creed. In other passages the essential life of the Church is attributed, now to the revelation of the Father (<a href="/context/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17-18</a>), now to the indwelling presence of the Son (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>), now to the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="/context/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38-39</a>). Here all are united in one comprehensive view. The order, however, is natural, not artificial. The exhortation to peace naturally leads to the conception of one Body, animated by the "one Spirit"; next, the remembrance of their calling leads to the "one Lord," who called them to Him in one faith and by one baptism; and all ends in the contemplation of the "one God and Father," who is not only above all and through all His creation, but specially in those who are adopted to a new sonship in Christ. (See <a href="/context/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22-23</a>.) In its completeness and depth this passage stands alone. It is interesting to compare and contrast with it the equally celebrated passage occupying the corresponding place in the Colossian Epistle (<a href="/context/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1-4</a>), and to gather from this the mingled similarity and difference in the main idea of those two Epistles--the Ephesian Epistle dwelling especially on the unity and regeneration of the whole body, the Colossian Epistle on the sole Headship and Deity of Christ. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - CHURCH PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH AND PROGRESS; THE CHURCH A BODY. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I therefore</span>. Inference not only from last chapter, but the whole Epistle. Paul's interest in the Ephesians led him to a double application of the great subject which he had expounded: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to ask God on their behalf that he would bestow on them the full measure of the blessing to which of his grace they were entitled (<a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a>); and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to entreat them on God's behalf to live in a way befitting their high calling (<a href="/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>.).
