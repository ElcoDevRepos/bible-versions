However, excessive consumption was associated with moral decay and loss of self-control. The Bible consistently warns against drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>). This command reflects a call to holiness and self-discipline, aligning with the broader biblical theme of living a life set apart for God (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p><b>which leads to reckless indiscretion</b><br>Drunkenness often results in behavior that is contrary to Christian values, such as immorality and foolishness. The term "reckless indiscretion" suggests actions that are thoughtless and irresponsible, leading to sin and spiritual harm. This aligns with the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-35</a> about the consequences of excessive drinking, emphasizing the need for wisdom and discernment.<p><b>Instead, be filled with the Spirit</b><br>This phrase contrasts the temporary and destructive influence of alcohol with the enduring and life-giving presence of the Holy Spirit. Being filled with the Spirit is a recurring theme in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>), signifying a life controlled and empowered by God. It involves a continuous, active submission to the Spirit's guidance, resulting in the fruit of the Spirit and a Christ-like character. This filling is essential for living out the Christian faith effectively and is a fulfillment of the promise of the Spirit's indwelling presence (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of trade and culture.

The choice is clear: reject anything that dulls spiritual senses and actively seek the Spirit&#8217;s continual fullness every day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.</span>--From the general idea of reckless levity, St. Paul passes on to the special sin of drunkenness, as not (like gluttony) primarily a gratification of the appetite, but as a reckless pursuit of excitement at all costs--glorified as an excitement of emotion, and even of wit and intellect, in such contemporary writers as Horace, and actually confused, as in the Dionysiac or Bacchanalian frenzy, with a divine inspiration. How necessary the admonition was we see by the directions as to the choice of clergy in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Tim. 3:28; <a href="/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>; <a href="/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>); the more necessary, because (as <a href="/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a> shows) the right use of wine was recognised. Hence St. Paul emphatically brands drunkenness as "excess," a word properly signifying "recklessness"--"incapable of saving," or denying itself anything, and naturally passing through this want of self-restraint into profligacy--rightly translated "riot" in <a href="/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.">Titus 1:6</a>, <a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm" title="Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:">1Peter 4:4</a>, as the corresponding adverb is rendered "riotous living" in <a href="/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13</a>. For drunkenness is at once the effect and cause of utter recklessness. It is the effect of a self-abandonment, by which the sensual or passionate elements of the nature are stimulated to frenzy, while the self-controlling judgment is drugged to sleep. It is the cause of yet greater recklessness: for as these passions and appetites become jaded, they need stronger and stronger stimulants, till the whole nature, bodily and mental, is lost in delirium or stupor. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be not intoxicated with wine, wherein is dissoluteness.</span> Drunkenness is suggested because it is a work of darkness; it is the foe to vigilance and earnestness, and it leads all who yield to it to act unwisely.
