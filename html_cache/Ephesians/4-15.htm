In the context of Ephesians, Paul contrasts this with the deceitful scheming mentioned earlier in the chapter. The Greek word for "truth" (aletheia) implies not just factual accuracy but sincerity and integrity. Love (agape) is the selfless, sacrificial love that reflects God's nature. This balance is crucial for maintaining unity and maturity within the church. The concept is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-2</a>, where love is essential for meaningful communication and action.<p><b>we will in all things grow up</b><br>The imagery of growth suggests a process of maturation and development. This growth is comprehensive, affecting all aspects of life and faith. The metaphor of growth is common in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a>, where he describes the church as God's field. The idea is that believers are to mature spiritually, moving from infancy to adulthood in their faith journey, as also encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>.<p><b>into Christ Himself</b><br>Christ is the ultimate goal and standard for Christian maturity. The phrase indicates a deep, personal relationship with Jesus, where believers are being conformed to His image (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). This transformation is not just individual but corporate, as the church collectively becomes more like Christ. The preposition "into" suggests movement and direction, emphasizing the dynamic nature of this growth.<p><b>who is the head</b><br>Christ as the head signifies His authority and leadership over the church, which is His body. This metaphor is used throughout the New Testament, notably in <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, to illustrate the relationship between Christ and the church. The head controls and directs the body, ensuring its health and function. This imagery underscores the importance of being connected to Christ for guidance and sustenance, as well as the unity and interdependence of believers within the body.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was an important center for early Christianity.

But both order and sense seem to point to the connection given in our version. The correct rendering is, <span class= "ital">being true in love; </span>including in this the "being true" to others, by speaking truly and acting honestly towards them (as in <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>), but including also the "being true" absolutely--that is, the loving the truth, and clinging to it at all costs. The latter element, indeed, is the one which stands here more properly in antithesis to the childish instability described in the preceding verse; as it is in itself the more important, and is, in fact, the only basis for the other.<p>"To thine own self be true,<p>And it will follow, as the night the day,<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man."<p>This "being true" is expressed in many forms. Sometimes as "being of the truth" (<a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1John 2:21</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1John 3:19</a>); sometimes as "abiding in the truth" (<a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>), or "having the truth in us" (<a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1John 1:8</a>); sometimes as "doing the truth" (<a href="/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>), and "walking in the truth" (<a href="/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-4.htm" title="I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.">3John 1:4</a>). In all cases it is closely connected with the idea of unity with Him who is Himself "the Truth" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But speaking the truth in love.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is hardly translatable in English it implies being true as well as speaking the truth and following the truth. Truth is the element in which we are to live, move, and have our being; fidelity to truth is the backbone of the Christian ministry. But truth must be inseparably married to love; good tidings spoken harshly are no good tidings; the charm of the message is destroyed by the discordant spirit of the messenger. The more painful the first impression which a truth is fitted to produce (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Ephesians</span> 2:1-3), the more need is there for dealing with it in love - a much-needed and much-neglected exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">May grow up into him in all things who is the Head, namely, Christ.</span> Growing up <span class="accented">into</span> Christ is like baptizing <span class="accented">into</span> the Name of the Father, etc.; it implies that the growth tends to a closer union to Christ, as, on the other hand, union to Christ causes the growth: the two act and react on each other. This growth is to be "in all things" - in the whole man - in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, in all the communicable properties of Christ. How great the work of growth is that should be sought in the case of every living believer is evident from the enormous gulf there is between his spiritual and moral state and that of Christ. Yet such growth is reasonable, considering the relation of the body to him, its Head.
