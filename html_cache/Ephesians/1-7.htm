The "Him" refers to Jesus Christ, highlighting the personal relationship and union believers have with Him. This union is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, underscoring that all spiritual blessings and salvation are found in Christ alone (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>).<p><b>we have redemption</b><br>Redemption in the biblical context refers to the act of being set free from bondage or slavery, often through the payment of a ransom. In the Old Testament, this concept is seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). In the New Testament, redemption is spiritual, freeing believers from the bondage of sin and death (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><b>through His blood</b><br>The shedding of blood is a critical element in the atonement for sin, rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Jesus' blood signifies the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling the requirements of the Law and establishing a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). This phrase underscores the cost of redemption and the depth of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>the forgiveness of our trespasses</b><br>Forgiveness is a key aspect of salvation, involving the removal of guilt and the restoration of a right relationship with God. Trespasses refer to sins or violations of God's law. This forgiveness is not earned but granted through Christ's atoning work (<a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>).<p><b>according to the riches of His grace</b><br>This phrase highlights the abundance and generosity of God's grace. Grace is unmerited favor, and its riches imply an inexhaustible supply. God's grace is the basis for redemption and forgiveness, emphasizing that salvation is a gift, not a result of human effort (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological insights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

(In <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, both are used.) In both passages we have united, as correspondent to each other, the two expressions under which our Lord Himself describes His atonement--in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, as the "giving His life a ransom for many," in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>, as "the shedding of His blood for the forgiveness of sins." These two expressions appear to be complementary to each other, rather than identical. (1) The primary idea in "redemption" is deliverance from a bondage, mostly the bondage of sin itself (see <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-21</a>); occasionally (and in this sense with a different Greek word), the bondage under sentence of punishment for sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>). Into that bondage man has plunged himself; God's mercy redeems him from it at an unspeakable price (<a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/context/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24-25</a>). (2) The primary idea in "the forgiveness of sins through His blood" is propitiation, that is, the offering to God "a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice" for sin, by One who is the Head and Representative of the human race (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>). So St. Paul interprets our Lord's words by the declaration that "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us" (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1Corinthians 5:7</a>); and it is notable that exactly in His words is the Atonement designated in the earliest apostolic preaching (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="/acts/10-43.htm" title="To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.">Acts 10:43</a>; <a href="/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>). Hence the former phrase looks at the Atonement from the side of God, the latter from the side of man; both being wrought by Him who is Son of God and Son of Man at once. Together they represent the whole truth. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom we have the redemption through his blood.</span> Some of the blessings referred to in ver. 3 are now specified - be-ginning with redemption (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>).
