The Greek word for "workmanship" is "poiema," suggesting a work of art or masterpiece. This implies that believers are intentionally and intricately designed by God. In the biblical context, this reflects the creation narrative in Genesis, where God forms humanity with purpose and care. It also connects to <a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges being "fearfully and wonderfully made."<p><b>created in Christ Jesus</b><br>This phrase highlights the new creation aspect of believers' identity. In <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, Paul states that anyone in Christ is a new creation, indicating a transformation that occurs through faith in Jesus. This creation is not merely physical but spiritual, signifying a rebirth and renewal. The phrase underscores the centrality of Christ in the believer's life, as it is through Him that this new creation is possible.<p><b>to do good works</b><br>The purpose of this new creation is to engage in good works. This aligns with <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>, which states that faith without works is dead, emphasizing that genuine faith manifests in actions. The cultural context of the early church involved a strong emphasis on community and service, reflecting Jesus' teachings in the Gospels about loving one's neighbor and serving others. These good works are not the means of salvation but the evidence of it.<p><b>which God prepared in advance</b><br>This phrase suggests divine foreknowledge and planning. It implies that God has a specific plan and purpose for each believer's life, echoing <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>, where God declares His plans for a hopeful future. Theologically, this speaks to the doctrine of predestination, where God, in His sovereignty, has ordained certain paths and actions for His people. It reassures believers of God's active role in their lives.<p><b>as our way of life</b><br>The phrase indicates that good works are not occasional acts but a continuous lifestyle. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, where He calls His followers to be the light of the world, consistently reflecting God's character. The historical context of the early church involved living out one's faith in a way that was countercultural, often facing persecution. This lifestyle of good works serves as a testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located.

The word rendered "workmanship" is only used elsewhere in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>, where it is applied to the "works" of God in creation. Probably here also it does not exclude our first creation. We are His wholly and absolutely. But the next clause shows that St. Paul refers especially to the "new creation" in Christ Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">Created in</span> <span class= "bld">Christ Jesus.</span>--This creation, when spoken of distinctively, is the "new creation" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>); as, indeed, is the case below (<a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>), "to create in Himself . . . one new man." In this passage, however, St. Paul dwells, not on distinction from the old creation, but rather on analogy to it; in both we are simply God's creatures.<p><span class= "bld">Unto good works</span>.--Properly, <span class= "ital">on the basis</span> (or, <span class= "ital">condition</span>)<span class= "ital"> of good works</span> (as in <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2Timothy 2:14</a>). The good works, in themselves future, being (as the next clause shows) contemplated as already existent in God's foreknowledge, and as an inseparable characteristic of the regenerate life. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are his workmanship.</span> Another illustration and evidence of grace. We have to be fashioned anew by God before we can do anything aright (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). Anything right in us is not the cause of grace, but its fruit. There seems to be no special reason for the change from the second to the first person. <span class="cmt_word">Created in Christ Jesus for good works.</span> So little inward capacity had we for such works, that we required to be created in Christ Jesus in order that we might do them. The inward new birth of the soul is indicated. When good works were required, this gracious change had to be wrought to secure them. The purpose of the new creation is to produce them. Christ "gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people of his own, zealous of good works." It is not good works first, and grace after; but grace first, and good works after (see <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</span> A further proof of the true origin of good works. They are the subjects of a Divine decree. Before the foundation of the world it was ordained that whoever should be saved by grace should walk in good works. The term "<span class="accented">walk</span>," here denotes the habitual tenor of the life; it is to be spent in an atmosphere of good works. Here we have one of the Divine safeguards against the abuse of the doctrine of salvation by grace. When men hear of salvation irrespective of works, they are apt to fancy that works are of little use, and do not need to be carefully attended to. On the contrary, they are part of the Divine decree, and if we are not living a life of good works, we have no reason to believe that we have been saved by grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
