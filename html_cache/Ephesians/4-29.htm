The term "unwholesome" can be understood as corrupt or rotten, akin to spoiled fruit. In the cultural context of Ephesus, a city known for its diverse and often morally lax society, believers were called to stand apart by their speech. The Bible frequently addresses the power of words, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>, which states that "death and life are in the power of the tongue." This directive aligns with the broader biblical teaching on purity and holiness, as seen in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-10</a>, which discusses the tongue's potential for both blessing and cursing.<p><b>but only what is helpful for building up the one in need</b><br>The focus here is on edification, a key theme in Paul's letters. The Greek term for "building up" is often used in the context of constructing a building, symbolizing the growth and strengthening of the church body. This reflects the communal nature of early Christian communities, where mutual support and encouragement were vital. The idea of helping "the one in need" underscores the call to be attentive to the specific needs of others, echoing the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where serving others is equated with serving Christ Himself.<p><b>and bringing grace to those who listen</b><br>Grace, a central theme in Pauline theology, is not only a gift from God but also something believers are to extend to others. This phrase suggests that speech should be a conduit of God's grace, reflecting His character and love. In the historical context, Ephesus was a hub of philosophical debate and rhetoric, making the call to gracious speech particularly countercultural. This aligns with <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>, which advises believers to let their conversation be "always full of grace, seasoned with salt." The transformative power of grace-filled words can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate embodiment of grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located.

The same use of the word "grace" is found in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15</a> ("that ye might have a second benefit"). The same idea is found in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>, "to perfect that which is lacking in your faith."<p>Here again we have a similar treatment of moral duty. The corrupt word is forbidden, not because it defiles the speaker's own soul, and is an offence in the pure eyes of God, but because it is a sin against others, pulling down instead of building them up, and aggravating, instead of supplying, their moral defects. Like the falsehood, and wrath, and dishonesty, forbidden above, it sins against the unity of all in God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth.</span> Not pagans only, but some of whom better things might be expected, need this charge.
