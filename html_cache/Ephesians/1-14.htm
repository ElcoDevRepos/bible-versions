This term can be understood as a down payment or earnest money, indicating a promise of full payment in the future. In the cultural context of the first century, a pledge was a common legal practice to secure a future transaction. Theologically, this signifies the assurance of salvation and eternal life for believers, as the Holy Spirit's presence in their lives is a foretaste of the full inheritance to come. This concept is echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22 and 5</a>:5, where the Spirit is also described as a guarantee.<p><b>until the redemption of those who are God&#8217;s possession</b><br>The phrase "redemption of those who are God&#8217;s possession" refers to the future aspect of salvation when believers will be fully redeemed and glorified. Redemption in biblical terms often implies a release or liberation, typically from sin and its consequences. This future redemption is the culmination of God's salvific plan, where believers will be fully conformed to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>). The idea of being God's possession is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is described as God's treasured possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). In the New Testament, this extends to all who are in Christ, emphasizing the intimate relationship between God and His people.<p><b>to the praise of His glory</b><br>This phrase underscores the ultimate purpose of God's redemptive work: His glory. Throughout <a href="/ephesians/1.htm">Ephesians 1</a>, Paul emphasizes that God's actions in salvation are meant to result in praise and worship of His glorious nature. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's glory is the central focus of creation and redemption (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). The repetition of this theme in <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 12, and 14</a> highlights the doxological purpose of God's plan, encouraging believers to live in a way that reflects and honors His majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as the "pledge of our inheritance," the Holy Spirit is given to believers as a guarantee of their future redemption and inheritance in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_possession.htm">God&#8217;s Possession</a></b><br>This term refers to believers who are considered God&#8217;s own people, set apart for His purposes and glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

The word "inheritance" has a correspondent meaning. It is a present possession (as in <a href="/acts/7-5.htm" title="And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.">Acts 7:5</a>), which shall be developed into a more precious future. "We are very members, incorporate in the mystical body of Christ, and also heirs through hope of His everlasting kingdom."<p><span class= "bld">Until the redemption of the purchased possession.</span>--The "redemption" here is the complete and final salvation from sin and death (as in <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>). The original word here rendered "purchased possession" properly means "the act of purchase or acquisition," and is so used in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>. But it seems clear that it is here used (in the sense of our version) with that confusion of idea, common in English, though rare in Greek, under which the result of an action is understood instead of the action itself, so that the word "purchases" is used for "things purchased," "acquisitions" for "things acquired" and the like. The transition is marked in relation to this same word in <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>, where the Israelites are spoken of as "a people for acquisition," that is, as a people acquired or purchased. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is the earnest of our inheritance.</span> The gift of the Spirit is not only a seal, but an earnest, firstfruit, or installment, a pledge that the rest shall follow. The seal of the Spirit not only assures us of the full inheritance to come, but gives us a right conception of its nature. It shows us the kind of provision God makes for those whom he takes as his heritage, his peculiar people. It is an inward heaven the Spirit brings them. "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." The full inheritance will consist in a heart in full sympathy with God, and in those occupations and joys, intellectual and moral, which are most congenial to such a heart. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the redemption of the purchased possession.</span> The <span class="accented">until</span> of the A.V. is not textual, and does not give the force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, which implies that the earnest of the Spirit is a contribution toward the result described; it tends to realize it. "Redemption" here is not quite equivalent to "redemption" in ver. 7; for there it is a thing accomplished, here it is a thing to come. It is obvious that here the meaning is the completed redemption - the full and final deliverance of the Lord's heritage from all sin and sorrow, from all the evils and disorders of this life. The term <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, translated" purchased possession," is an unusual one. But its resemblance to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Septuagint rendering for "a special people;" its use by Peter, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "a peculiar people;" the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood;" - show that it must be regarded in this place as denoting the special, own, purchased possession of God, whose final glory is so often presented to our thoughts in this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">To the praise of his glory.</span> For the third time in this paragraph, these or similar words are introduced. In this place the precise meaning is that the consummation of redemption will be the highest tribute to God's glory - his infinite excellence will be wonderfully manifested thereby. Neither men nor angels are qualified to apprehend the glorious excellence of God in an abstract way; it needs to be revealed, exhibited in acts and operations. The teaching of this verse is that it will be manifested with triumphant brightness in the final redemption of the Church, when the groans of nature shall come to an end, and the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into "the glorious liberty of the sons of God" (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
