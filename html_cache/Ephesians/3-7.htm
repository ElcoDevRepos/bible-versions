The term "servant" (Greek: diakonos) implies one who serves under authority, reflecting Paul's submission to Christ. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>, where greatness is equated with servanthood. Paul's role as a servant of the gospel highlights his mission to spread the message of Christ, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>by the gift of God&#8217;s grace</b><br>Paul attributes his role to God's grace, underscoring that it is unearned and divinely bestowed. This grace is central to Paul's theology, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God. The concept of grace is foundational in understanding the New Covenant, contrasting with the works-based righteousness of the Old Covenant. Paul's transformation from persecutor to apostle (Acts 9) exemplifies the transformative power of grace.<p><b>given me through the working of His power</b><br>The phrase highlights the divine empowerment behind Paul's ministry. The "working of His power" (Greek: energeia) suggests active, dynamic force, reminiscent of the power that raised Christ from the dead (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>). This power enables believers to fulfill their God-given callings, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>. Paul's ministry, marked by miracles and endurance through suffering (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>), demonstrates the reality of this divine power at work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is a central figure in the New Testament, known for his missionary journeys and theological contributions to early Christianity.

In fact, what is a "gift" in its source, is "effectual working" in its actual nature. On the phrase "effectual working of power"--a divine force in the soul, not latent but energetic--see <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>. In the whole of this passage, however, the chief emphasis is laid, not on the spiritual power, but on the freedom of God's gift to the Apostle of this high privilege of preaching the mystery of the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of which I became a minister</span>; did not gradually grow up to the office, but became, at a given time and place, a minister, <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a servant. <span class="cmt_word">According to the gift of the grace of God.</span> The office of serving Christ was a gift, most undeserved on Paul's part, who had been a persecutor and injurious, but flowing from the free grace of God, his sovereign, unmerited mercy. Which was given me according to the working of his power. This denotes the manner of the gift; the gift itself, apostleship to the Gentiles, would have been little had it not been accompanied with Divine power. Spiritual office without spiritual power is miserable; but in Paul's case there was the power as well as the office; not merely the power of working miracles, as some have held, but besides this, the power of spiritual insight into the meaning of Scripture - power of exposition, power of demonstration, power of persuasion (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>, etc.).
