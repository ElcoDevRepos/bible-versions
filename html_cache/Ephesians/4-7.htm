It highlights the personal relationship each Christian has with Christ. In the context of the early church, this would have been significant as it underscores the inclusivity of the gospel message, reaching both Jews and Gentiles. The phrase also reflects the unity and diversity within the body of Christ, as each member is uniquely gifted.<p><b>grace has been given</b><br>The concept of grace is central to Christian theology, representing unmerited favor from God. This grace is not earned but is a gift, underscoring the doctrine of salvation by faith. In the cultural context of Ephesus, a city known for its diverse religious practices, the idea of grace would contrast sharply with the transactional nature of pagan worship. This grace empowers believers for service and spiritual growth.<p><b>according to the measure</b><br>This indicates that the grace given is not uniform but varies according to God's sovereign will. It suggests a tailored distribution of spiritual gifts, aligning with the needs and purposes of the church. This measure is not based on human merit but on divine wisdom, ensuring that each believer is equipped for their specific role within the body of Christ.<p><b>of the gift of Christ</b><br>The ultimate gift is Christ Himself, whose life, death, and resurrection provide the foundation for all spiritual blessings. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption, where Christ is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and types, such as the sacrificial lamb. The gift of Christ encompasses both salvation and the empowerment for ministry, reflecting the dual aspects of grace: justification and sanctification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage unity and maturity in the faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse population and the Temple of Artemis.

Compare parable of talents. "Grace" does not refer merely to supernatural gifts, but also to the ordinary spiritual gifts of men. These are varied, because what each gets he gets for the good of the rest; the Church is a fellowship or brotherhood, where each has an interest in all and all in each, and is bound to act accordingly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to each</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(hekast&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1538.htm">Strong's 1538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Each (of more than two), every one.
