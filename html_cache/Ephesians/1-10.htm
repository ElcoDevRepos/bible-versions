The "fullness of time" suggests a culmination or completion of a specific period in history, echoing <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, where God sent His Son at the perfect moment. This concept reflects the biblical theme of God's perfect timing in salvation history, as seen in the prophecies of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, which foretells the coming of the Messiah. The phrase underscores the idea that history is moving towards a divinely appointed climax, orchestrated by God.<p><b>to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the unifying work of Christ, which is central to the message of Ephesians. The reconciliation of "all things" points to the restoration of creation, disrupted by sin, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This reconciliation is not limited to humanity but extends to the entire cosmos, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, where Christ's work on the cross is said to reconcile all things to Himself. The phrase "in Christ" emphasizes the centrality of Jesus in God's redemptive plan, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, which speak of a coming ruler who will establish peace and justice.

We note (1) that the word "dispensation" is usually applied to the action of the servants of God, as "dispensers of His mysteries." (See <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm" title="For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.">1Corinthians 9:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>.) Here, however, and in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, it is applied to the disposal of all by God Himself, according to "the law which He has set Himself to do all things by." Next (2) that the word "fulness," or <span class= "ital">completeness, </span>frequently used by St. Paul, is only found in connection with time in this passage, and in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a> ("when the fulness of time was come"). There, however, the reference is to a point of time, marking the completion of the preparation for our Lord's coming; here, apparently, to a series of "seasons," "which the Father hath put in His own power" (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>) for the completion of the acts of the Mediatorial kingdom described in the words following.

Such a notion would be in fiat contradiction to the doctrine of Divine election, which dominates the whole passage. God's purpose is to form a united kingdom, consisting of the unfallen and the restored - the unfallen in heaven, and the restored on earth, and to gather this whole body together under Christ as its Head (see <a href="/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>). We cannot say that this purpose has been fully effected as yet; but things are moving towards it, and one day it will be wholly realized.
