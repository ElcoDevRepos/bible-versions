The imagery of "putting off" suggests the removal of clothing, symbolizing a complete renunciation of the old lifestyle. In the cultural context of Ephesus, a city known for its pagan practices and idolatry, this would have been a radical call to transformation. The concept of shedding the old life is echoed in <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9-10</a>, where believers are urged to put off the old self and put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator.<p><b>your old self</b><br>The "old self" refers to the unregenerate nature that is dominated by sin and separated from God. This is the nature that believers are called to abandon. In <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, Paul speaks of the old self being crucified with Christ so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless. This transformation is not merely a moral reformation but a spiritual renewal that aligns with the new identity in Christ. Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of sanctification, where believers are progressively conformed to the image of Christ.<p><b>which is being corrupted</b><br>The present tense "is being corrupted" indicates an ongoing process of moral and spiritual decay. This corruption is inherent in the sinful nature and is contrasted with the renewal that comes through the Holy Spirit. In <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>, Paul contrasts the outward wasting away with the inward renewal day by day, highlighting the continuous nature of both corruption and renewal. The corruption of the old self is a result of living apart from God's truth and grace.<p><b>by its deceitful desires</b><br>Deceitful desires are those that promise satisfaction and fulfillment but ultimately lead to destruction and separation from God. These desires are rooted in the flesh and are contrary to the desires of the Spirit, as outlined in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-17</a>. The deceitfulness lies in their ability to mask the true consequences of sin, leading individuals away from the truth of the Gospel. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> describes how desire, when conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when fully grown, brings forth death. This highlights the need for discernment and reliance on the Holy Spirit to overcome such desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.

We don&#8217;t drift into holiness; we choose to &#8220;put off&#8221; the sin-clothes we once wore.

Before Christ we were spiritually dead, &#8220;slaves to sin&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). The moment we trusted Jesus, God gave us a new nature (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>), yet the residue of the old person still tries to dominate. Paul says, &#8220;Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a>). In practice:<p>&#8226; Recall who you are in Christ each morning.<p>&#8226; Resist the lie that sin defines you; Christ does.<p>&#8226; Rely on the Spirit&#8217;s power, not sheer willpower (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which is being corrupted</b><p>The old self isn&#8217;t neutral; it decays.

The original may be interpreted either of the teaching of a fact, "that ye did put off . . . and are being renewed," &c., or of a duty, "that ye put off . . . and be renewed." The latter is, on the whole, the more probable, although the former would yield a simpler sense. It is to be noted that the words "put off" and "put on" in the original denote a distinct and complete act; the word "be renewed," a continuous and still incomplete process. The complete act is consummated, and the continuous process begun, by the practical "learning" of Christ--that is, by growth in spiritual communion with Him.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Concerning the former conversation.</span>--So far, that is, as concerns the conversation or mode of life described above (<a href="/context/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17-19</a>) as the moral condition of heathenism. It is in relation to this, the corruption of the true humanity, and not in relation to the true humanity itself, that the "old man" is put off.<p>The phrase "the old man" (found also in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>) is here illustrated by the description following: <span class= "ital">which is being marred in virtue of the lusts of deceit.</span> The word rendered "corrupt" expresses not so much pollution as disintegration and decay, much as in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>; and so carries out the idea implied in the epithet "old." The unregenerate nature, subject to "the lusts of deceit"--the lusts, that is, of the spirit of delusion, blind themselves, and blinding the soul which yields to them--is gradually sinking into the spiritual decay which must become spiritual death, unless by the effort of faith, entering into the communion with Christ, it be, once for all, "put off." The various qualities of the nature thus stripped off are variously described: in Rom. 13:22, as the "works of darkness; in <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>, as simply "encumbrance;" in <a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">James 1:21</a>, as "filthiness and excess of evil;" in <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1Peter 2:1</a>, as "malice, and craft, and hypocrisies, and envies." All these are the "lusts of deceit." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye put off, as concerning the former conversation, the old man.</span> The sum of Christ's practical lessons is given in two particulars - putting off and putting on. The change is very decided and very complete. It is emphatically <span class="accented">personal</span>; not a mere change of opinions or of religious observances, but of life, habit, character; not altering a few things, but first putting off <span class="accented">the man</span> as we put off a garment. "It is a change which brings the mind under the government of truth, and gives to the life a new aspect of integrity and devoutness." Which is rotting according to the lusts of deceit.

Sin is a disintegrating dissolving thing, causing putridity, and in all cases, when unchecked, tending towards it. Deceit is personified; it is an agent of evil, sending out lusts which seem harmless but are really ruinous - their real character is concealed; they come as ministers of pleasure, they end as destructive tyrants. Lust of power, lust of money, lust of pleasure, have all this character; they are the offspring of deceit, and always to be shunned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to put off</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(apothesthai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Middle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_659.htm">Strong's 659: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay off or aside, renounce, stow away, put.
