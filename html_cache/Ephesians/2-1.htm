In biblical terms, "dead" refers to a separation from God, the source of life. This concept is rooted in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, where God warns Adam that eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil would result in death. The death here is not immediate physical death but spiritual death, a separation from God. This spiritual death is a universal condition, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The idea of being "dead" underscores the inability of humans to save themselves, emphasizing the need for divine intervention.<p><b>in your trespasses</b><br>"Trespasses" refers to specific acts of wrongdoing or deviations from the right path. The term implies a conscious crossing of boundaries set by God. In the cultural context of the time, laws and boundaries were well understood, and crossing them had serious consequences. This concept is echoed in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>), where forgiveness of "trespasses" is sought. The use of "your" personalizes the message, indicating that these are individual acts for which each person is accountable. Theologically, this highlights the personal nature of sin and the need for personal repentance and forgiveness.<p><b>and sins</b><br>"Sins" is a broader term that encompasses both acts of commission and omission, as well as the inherent sinful nature of humanity. The Greek word for sin, "hamartia," means missing the mark, akin to an archer missing a target. This concept is prevalent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, which explains that sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and death through sin. The dual mention of "trespasses and sins" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of human wrongdoing, covering both specific actions and the general state of sinfulness. This underscores the totality of human depravity and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.

The words "hath He quickened" (or, properly, <span class= "ital">did He quicken</span>) are supplied here from <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>--rightly, as expressing the true sense and tending to greater clearness, but perhaps not necessarily.<p><span class= "bld">Trespasses and sins.</span>--These two words, more often used separately, are here brought together, to form a climax. The word rendered "trespass" signifies a "swerving aside and falling"; the word rendered "sins" is generally used by St. Paul in the singular to denote "sin" in the abstract, and signifies an entire "missing of the mark" of life. Hence, even in the plural, it denotes universal and positive principles of evil doing, while "trespass" rather points to failure in visible and special acts of those not necessarily out of the right way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - SPIRITUAL HISTORY OF THE EPHESIANS.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1f00;&#x3c2;</span> is not governed by any verb going before; it manifestly depends on the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 5, but it is separated from it by a new digression (vers. 2, 3), on which the apostle immediately starts. While the same quickening power of God was exerted on Christ and on the Ephesians, it was exerted to very different effects: in the case of Christ, raising him literally from the dead and exalting him to heavenly glory; in the case of the Ephesians, raising them from spiritual death and exalting them to high spiritual privileges. We may observe the change from the second to the first person, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, in this chapter as in <a href="/ephesians/1.htm">Ephesians 1</a>. Second person (vers. 1, 8, 11); first (vers. 3, 10, 14); and the two streams brought together (ver. 18). The chapter closes beautifully with an emblem of the Church as the one temple of which <span class="accented">all</span> believers are parts. The <span class="accented">death</span> ascribed to the Ephesians in their natural state is evidently <span class="accented">spiritual</span> death, and "trespasses and sins," being in the dative (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), seems to indicate the cause of death - "dead through your trespasses and your sins" (R.V.); "dead <span class="accented">of</span> your trespasses," etc., is suggested by Alford. It is not easy to assign a different meaning to the two nouns here; some suggest <span class="accented">acts</span> of transgression for the one, and sinful tendencies or principles for the other, but this distinction cannot be carried out in all other passages. The killing effect of sin is indicated. As sins of sensuality kill truthfulness, industry, integrity, and all virtue, so sin generally, affecting as it does our whole nature, kills, or does not suffer to live, the affections and movements of the spiritual life. A state of "death" implies previous life - the <span class="accented">race</span> lived before; it implies also a state of insensibility, of utter powerlessness and helplessness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
