The concept of an "eternal purpose" suggests a plan that transcends time and human history, rooted in God's sovereign will. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, which speaks of God choosing us in Christ before the creation of the world. The eternal nature of this purpose underscores God's omniscience and omnipotence, ensuring that His plans are unchangeable and certain.<p><b>that He accomplished</b><br>The use of "accomplished" indicates the fulfillment and completion of God's plan. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness in bringing His promises to fruition. The Greek term used here can also imply a sense of bringing to full realization, suggesting that what God set out to do has been fully realized. This is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, emphasizing His ability to bring His purposes to completion.<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b><br>Christ Jesus is central to God's eternal purpose, serving as the means through which God's plan is realized. This phrase emphasizes the role of Jesus as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, and His life, death, and resurrection are the pivotal events in God's redemptive history. The phrase also highlights the union believers have with Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of being crucified with Christ.<p><b>our Lord</b><br>Referring to Jesus as "our Lord" acknowledges His authority and divinity. This title affirms the early Christian confession of Jesus as Lord, which was a radical declaration in the context of the Roman Empire, where Caesar was often hailed as lord. The lordship of Christ is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. This title also signifies the personal relationship believers have with Jesus, recognizing Him as their sovereign ruler and master.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological insights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.

The verb in this clause is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, which he made, and it has been debated whether it denotes the original formation of the purpose, or the execution of it under Christ. With A.V. and R.V., we prefer the former. The object of the apostle is to indicate that the purpose existed from eternity; but, besides, the meaning of "fulfilled" or "executed" can hardly be sustained by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The closing formula, "in Christ Jesus," is perfectly applicable to the eternal formation of the purpose; it is the constantly returning indication of the element in which the whole scheme of grace had its beginning, its progress, and its end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">according to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] eternal</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7984;&#974;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ai&#333;n&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_165.htm">Strong's 165: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the same as aei; properly, an age; by extension, perpetuity; by implication, the world; specially a Messianic period.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">purpose</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(prothesin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4286.htm">Strong's 4286: </a> </span><span class="str2">From protithemai; a setting forth, i.e. proposal; specially, the show-bread as exposed before God.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7971;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He accomplished</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
