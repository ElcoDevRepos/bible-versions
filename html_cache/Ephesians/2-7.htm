The "coming ages" refers to future periods in God's redemptive history, emphasizing the eternal nature of God's plan. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His unfolding plan for humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning. The phrase also reflects the eschatological hope found throughout the New Testament, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>He might display the surpassing riches of His grace</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's intention to reveal the abundance of His grace. The "surpassing riches" suggests an immeasurable and inexhaustible wealth of grace, which is a central theme in Paul's writings. This grace is not just sufficient but overwhelmingly abundant, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, where Paul states that where sin increased, grace abounded all the more. The display of grace is a testament to God's character, highlighting His generosity and mercy towards humanity.<p><b>demonstrated by His kindness to us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the tangible expression of God's grace through His kindness. The kindness of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with His covenant faithfulness and mercy. In <a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-5</a>, Paul speaks of the kindness and love of God appearing in the form of salvation. This kindness is not abstract but is demonstrated in concrete actions, particularly in the redemptive work of Christ. It reflects God's personal and relational nature, as He actively engages with His creation.<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b><br>The culmination of God's grace and kindness is found "in Christ Jesus." This phrase underscores the centrality of Christ in God's redemptive plan. Jesus is the mediator through whom God's grace is extended to humanity, as seen in <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>, where grace and truth are realized through Jesus Christ. The phrase also highlights the believer's union with Christ, a key theological concept in Paul's letters, indicating that all spiritual blessings, including grace and kindness, are accessed through a relationship with Jesus. This union is foundational to the Christian faith, as it is through Christ that believers are reconciled to God and receive the fullness of His grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse culture and the Temple of Artemis.

Here, again, the manifestation of the riches of God's grace is looked upon as His special delight, and as His chosen way of manifesting His own self to His creatures.<p><span class= "bld">In his kindness.</span>--The word "kindness" (properly, <span class= "ital">facility, </span>or <span class= "ital">readiness to serve another</span>) is applied to that phase of God's mercy in which it shows Him as "ready to receive, and most willing to pardon." Thus we find it in <a href="/luke/6-35.htm" title="But love you your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.">Luke 6:35</a> used for His goodness "to the unthankful and evil"; in <a href="/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a> it is joined with "long-suffering and patience"; in <a href="/romans/11-22.htm" title="Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.">Romans 11:22</a> opposed to abrupt "severity"; in <a href="/titus/3-4.htm" title="But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,">Titus 3:4</a>, connected with love to man, "philanthropy"; and it is also used in similar connections when attributed to man (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>). Hence in this passage it is especially appropriate, because so much stress has been laid on the former sinfulness and godlessness of those to whom God's mercy waited to be gracious. There is a similar appropriateness in the repetition of the name of our Lord "through Christ Jesus," for this gentle patience and readiness to receive sinners was so marked a feature of His ministry that to the Pharisees it seemed an over-facility, weakly condoning sin. "Through Him," therefore, the kindness of God was both shown and given. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That in the ages to come he might show forth the riches of his grace.</span> A special purpose served by God's free grace bestowed on such persons as the Ephesians. It was intended as a lesson for future ages. "The ages to come" denotes eras to begin from that time, running on now, and to continue hereafter. It would be a profitable lesson for the people of these ages to think of the Ephesians, far as they were by nature from God, receiving his blessing so abundantly. From this they would learn how great are the riches of God's grace. <span class="cmt_word">In kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.</span> The particular channel in which the riches of his grace flows is kindness shown to us in Christ Jesus. Kindness in the <span class="accented">matter</span> of the blessing, forgiving us freely, and accepting and adopting us in him; kindness in the <span class="accented">manner</span> of the blessing, dealing with us as Jesus dealt with the woman that was a sinner, or with the thief on the cross, or with Peter after he had fallen, or with Saul of Tarsus; kindness in the <span class="accented">extent</span> of the blessing, providing amply for every want; kindness in the <span class="accented">duration</span> of the blessing - for evermore. But again, the Medium or Mediator of blessing is specified - "in Christ Jesus." It is not the kindness of providence, not the natural bountifulness of God, but that kindness and bountifulness which are specially connected with the atoning work of Christ: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">in order that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
