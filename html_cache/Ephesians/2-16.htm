In the context of Ephesians, Paul emphasizes that through Christ, these two groups are brought together into a unified relationship with God. This reconciliation fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth. The concept of reconciliation is central to the New Testament, highlighting the restoration of a broken relationship between humanity and God, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>.<p><b>in one body</b><br>The "one body" refers to the Church, the body of Christ, where all believers, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background, are united. This unity is a key theme in Ephesians, as Paul stresses the importance of the Church as a single entity composed of diverse members. The metaphor of the body is also used in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where Paul describes the Church as one body with many parts, each with its own function but all working together in harmony.<p><b>through the cross</b><br>The cross is the means by which reconciliation is achieved. It symbolizes the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, which atones for sin and bridges the gap between humanity and God. The cross is central to Christian theology, representing both the justice and mercy of God. In <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, Paul similarly speaks of peace being made through the blood of the cross. The cross is not just a historical event but a transformative power that changes the spiritual status of believers.<p><b>by which He put to death their hostility</b><br>The hostility between Jews and Gentiles, as well as between humanity and God, is abolished through Christ's work on the cross. This enmity is not only a social and cultural division but also a spiritual one, rooted in sin. <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-15</a> earlier mentions the "dividing wall of hostility" being broken down. The death of Christ is the ultimate act that destroys this enmity, allowing for peace and unity.

Unity is therefore not merely a goal; it is the accomplished gift of the cross, to be guarded and enjoyed by every believer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body.</span>--In this verse the latter subject opens--the reconciliation of all to God. On the reconciliation of man to God, see the great passage <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18-21</a>. But it should be noted that in the original the word used here and in <a href="/context/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20-21</a> (and nowhere else) is a compound signifying not simply to "conciliate," but properly to "reconcile,"--that is to reunite those who were originally united, but afterwards separated by the sin of man. This brings out the profound idea, which so especially characterises these Epistles, of a primeval unity of all created being in Christ, marred and broken by sin, and restored by His manifestation in human flesh. Note that the passage in the Colossians (on which see Notes) has a far wider scope than this passage--"having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things to Himself; by Him (I say), whether they be things on earth or things in heaven." On the other hand, this passage characteristically still lays stress on the idea "in one body"--that is, as throughout, His mystical body, the Church--although probably the phrase is suggested here by the thought of the natural body of the Lord offered on the cross, which is clearly referred to in <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. There is a similar connection of thought in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16-17</a>, "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we are all one bread, and one body."<p><span class= "bld">By the cross, having slain the enmity thereby.</span>--In this verse (in accordance with the context) "the enmity," which by His death He "slew," is the barrier between God and man, created by sin, but brought out by the Law, as hard and rigid law, "in ordinances" of which St. Paul does not hesitate to say that "sin took occasion by it," and "by it slew" man (<a href="/romans/7-11.htm" title="For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.">Romans 7:11</a>). This is illustrated by the cognate, though different, metaphor of <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>, where it is said of Christ that He "blotted out the handwriting of ordinances which was against us, which was contrary unto us, and took it out of the way, <span class= "ital">nailing it to His cross."</span> Compare also, in <a href="/context/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19-20</a>, the connection of spiritual "death to the Law" with our partaking of our Lord's crucifixion: "I, through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God. <span class= "ital">I am crucified with Christ, </span>nevertheless I live. . . . by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and <span class= "ital">gave Himself for me."</span> By His death Christ has both redeemed us from sin, and also "redeemed (properly, <span class= "ital">bought</span>) us from the curse of the Law" (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross.</span> Exegetical of preceding statements, and making emphatic the fact of reconciliation to God on <span class="accented">the same footing and by the same means</span>; both were to be reconciled <span class="accented">in</span>, <span class="accented">one body</span> (see <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>) and <span class="accented">by the cross</span>. No preference was to be given to the Jew facilitating his union to Christ: the Gentile was to be taken into Christ's body as readily as the Jew. In reference to the sense in which reconciliation was effected by the cross of Jesus, some say it was only as the cross demonstrated to men the love of God and his willingness to bless them; while others maintain very strongly that it was as providing a satisfaction to God's justice for their guilt, and thus enabling him to receive and bless the sinner. Not only the analogy of other passages of Scripture as well as of this Epistle justifies the latter view, but preeminently the words, "by the cross." If Christ had only to <span class="accented">proclaim</span> God's friendship toward sinners, why should he have suffered on the cross? The cross as a mere pulpit is hideous; as an altar it is glorious. The love of God is ill revealed, if it subjected Jesus to unnecessary agony. The love of both Father and Son is indeed commended, if the agony was voluntarily borne by the Son, and permitted by the Father, as being indispensable for the pardon of the sinner. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span> denotes the whole process of reconciliation (see Eadie). <span class="cmt_word">Having slain the enmity thereby</span> (or, <span class="accented">thereon</span>). "The enmity" is the same as at the beginning of ver. 15 - the enmity of man to God. The destruction of this enmity is one of the effects of the cross, though not the only effect; it is necessary to root out the enmity of the carnal mind. That this is the meaning here seems plain from <a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, "If, <span class="accented">when we were enemies</span>, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." The apostle there makes no allusion to the enmity of Jew and Gentile to each other, but to this wider fact - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. If any words can denote the result of a propitiatory sacrifice, it is surely "reconciled to God by the death of his Son." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">reconciling</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#940;&#958;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(apokatallax&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_604.htm">Strong's 604: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reconcile, change from one state of feeling to another.
