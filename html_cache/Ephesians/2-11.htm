Paul often uses "therefore" to connect his theological teachings with practical implications. Here, he urges the readers to recall their past condition, emphasizing the importance of understanding one's spiritual journey and transformation.<p><b>that formerly you who are Gentiles in the flesh</b><br>Paul addresses the Gentile believers, highlighting their previous state before coming to faith in Christ. "Gentiles in the flesh" refers to their physical, ethnic identity, distinct from the Jewish people. This distinction was significant in the first-century context, where Jews and Gentiles were often separated by cultural and religious barriers.<p><b>and called uncircumcised</b><br>The term "uncircumcised" was used by Jews to describe Gentiles, often with a sense of disdain or separation. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>), marking the Jewish people as God's chosen. This label underscores the division and hostility that existed between Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>by the so-called circumcision</b><br>Paul refers to the Jewish people, who prided themselves on their physical circumcision as a sign of their covenant relationship with God. However, Paul uses "so-called" to suggest that true circumcision is not merely physical but spiritual, a theme he explores in other letters (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>).<p><b>(that done in the body by human hands)&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical nature of circumcision, contrasting it with the spiritual transformation that comes through faith in Christ. Paul often argues that physical rituals are insufficient for salvation, pointing instead to the need for a heart transformed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).

Thus, in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>, it is contrasted with the practical reality of obedience to God's commandments; in <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>, with the inner reality of "faith working by love "; in <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>, with the divine gift of the "new creation"; in <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>, with the spiritual unity of all in Christ.

He is always gathering up his views into some lesson. They are to "remember" the change between the past and the present - what they were by nature, and what they had become by grace. This is most useful to all, even though the contrast between the two be not so vivid as in the case of Paul and the Ephesians. The contrast is indicated in various particulars, both of outward condition and of inward privilege and character. First, the old condition. They were "Gentiles in respect of the flesh" - not bearing <span class="accented">on their bodies</span> the mark of the Israel of God, therefore not marked out for blessing, not apparently near it. <span class="cmt_word">Who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands.</span> Nicknamed, as it were, Uncircumcision by those who in a fleshly or mechanical, but not always in the true spiritual sense (comp. <a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), were called Circumcision; they had a name which denoted the very opposite of that given to God's people - another illustration of their apparent distance from blessing; they revolved round the sun, as it were, not in the nearer orbits of planets warmed, brightened, and beautified by the solar beams, but in the outermost ring of all - like the cold, dark orbit of Uranus or Neptune, which the sunbeams hardly reach to lighten or to warm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Dio)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1352.htm">Strong's 1352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wherefore, on which account, therefore.
