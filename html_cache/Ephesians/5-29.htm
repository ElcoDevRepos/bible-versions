In the biblical context, the body is often seen as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>), highlighting the importance of self-care and respect for one's physical being. Historically, the Greco-Roman world valued physical health and beauty, which aligns with the idea of caring for one's body. This concept is used here to illustrate the inherent understanding of self-preservation and care, which is then applied to the relationship between Christ and the church.<p><b>but he nourishes and cherishes it</b><br>Nourishing and cherishing imply providing sustenance and tender care. In the cultural context of the time, nourishment would include providing food and protection, while cherishing suggests a deeper emotional and spiritual care. This reflects the biblical principle of love and care found in the marriage relationship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man is to leave his parents and be united with his wife, becoming one flesh. The nurturing aspect is also seen in God's provision for Israel throughout the Old Testament, where He is depicted as a provider and protector.<p><b>just as Christ does the church</b><br>This phrase draws a parallel between the care a person gives to their own body and the care Christ provides for the church. Christ's relationship with the church is one of sacrificial love and devotion, as demonstrated in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, where Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. This reflects the typology of Christ as the bridegroom and the church as His bride, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>. The church, as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>), is nourished through the Word, sacraments, and the Holy Spirit, ensuring its growth and

Mean</div><b>Indeed, no one ever hated his own body</b><p>&#8211; Paul appeals to an everyday reality: caring for ourselves is instinctive.<p>&#8211; Scripture assumes this normal self-regard (<a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a>).<p>&#8211; The point is not selfishness but the obvious truth that people feed, clothe, and protect themselves rather than despise their bodies.<p>&#8211; This serves as a baseline for the husband&#8211;wife relationship: if a man naturally guards his own flesh, loving his wife is the same kind of care because &#8220;the two will become one flesh&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he nourishes and cherishes it</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Nourish&#8221;

ill.<p>&#8226; Guard against danger.<p>&#8211; In marriage, that habitual attention becomes a deliberate ministry: husbands are called to meet physical, emotional, and spiritual needs with the same diligence they show themselves (<a href="/colossians/3-19.htm">Colossians 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Christ does the church</b><p>&#8211; The self-care analogy reaches its climax: Jesus&#8217; care for believers is the model.<p>&#8211; Christ &#8220;loved the church and gave Himself up for her&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>), proving His devotion by:<p>&#8226; Providing spiritual nourishment&#8212;the Word, fellowship, and His Spirit (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>; <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Cherishing her with constant intercession and presence (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew

&#8220;to present her to Himself in splendor&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<p>&#8211; Because the church is His own body (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians

5:29</a> grounds Paul&#8217;s call for husbands to love their wives in an undeniable fact: people naturally care for their own bodies. That instinct illustrates how Christ continually provides, protects, and tenderly treasures His body, the church. Therefore, marital love is to mirror Jesus&#8217; unwavering, nourishing, cherishing devotion&#8212;daily, tangibly, and sacrificially&#8212;affirming the profound unity God designed for husband and wife and showcasing the Savior&#8217;s faithful love for His redeemed people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">His own flesh</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as above (<a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28</a>), <span class= "ital">his own body.</span> There are two parts of the natural care for our own bodies; first, "to nourish" (properly, <span class= "ital">to rear them up from childhood, </span>as in <a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm" title="And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.">Ephesians 6:4</a>), and then "to cherish" (literally, <span class= "ital">to keep them warm</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>to provide all they need for health, and comfort, and life. In all that corresponds to both, the husband is to show love to the wife, not only as a self, but as a weaker self, for whom he is bound to think and to act. It may be noted in passing that the very comparison accords with the Christian idea of the body as a part of the true self, redeemed to be a temple of God; and is utterly incongruous with the Gnostic conceptions (already beginning at Colossae, probably not unknown in other Asiatic churches) of all matter as the source of evil, and of the body as that for which the spirit should not deign to care.<p>(29, 30) <span class= "bld">Even as the Lord the church: for we . . .</span>--Again St. Paul escapes from the type to rest on the Antitype (see <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>). The idea of the natural rearing and cherishing the body suggests the thought of the tender care of Christ, in which He "rears up" His Church from weak infancy to full maturity in heaven, and all the while "cherishes it (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1Thessalonians 2:7</a>, spoken of His servants) as a nurse cherisheth her children," "carrying it in His bosom" (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>), comforting and cheering its childlike weakness. Hence he goes back again to speak with great and special emphasis of our unity with Him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the Church.</span> To hate one's wife is as irrational as to hate one's own flesh, and as, on the other hand, men constantly nourish and cherish their flesh, protecting it from hurt, seeking to heal it when hurt, and generally to promote its welfare and comfort, so ought husbands to act towards their wives. In this aspect of the case, too, the sharp eye of the apostle finds an analogy between the relation of the wife to the husband and that of the Church to Christ, expanded in the next verso. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Indeed,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
