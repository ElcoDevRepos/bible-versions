The concept of being "in Him" refers to the believer's union with Christ, a central theme in Pauline theology. This union is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign will. The idea of being chosen is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>, where Jesus tells His disciples, "You did not choose me, but I chose you." This reflects the biblical theme of God initiating a relationship with His people.<p><b>before the foundation of the world</b><br>This phrase indicates the eternal nature of God's plan, suggesting that His purposes transcend time and human history. It implies that God's decision to choose believers was made before creation itself, highlighting His omniscience and sovereignty. This pre-temporal choice is also mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, which speaks of God's grace given "before the beginning of time." It underscores the idea that salvation is part of God's eternal purpose.<p><b>to be holy and blameless in His presence</b><br>The purpose of God's choosing is for believers to be "holy and blameless," reflecting God's own character. Holiness involves being set apart for God's purposes, while blamelessness suggests moral integrity. This echoes Old Testament themes, such as in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God commands His people to be holy because He is holy. The phrase "in His presence" implies living a life that is pleasing to God, aligning with the call to live righteously as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>.<p><b>In love</b><br>This phrase can be seen as the motivation behind God's choosing and the believer's call to holiness. Love is a fundamental attribute of God's character, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>, which states, "God is love." This love is not only the basis for God's actions but also the expected response from believers, as they are called to love God and others. The concept of love as a driving force is central to the Christian faith, encapsulating the essence of the gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who chose believers in Christ before the foundation of the world, emphasizing His sovereignty and eternal purpose.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The "Him" in whom believers are chosen, highlighting the centrality of Christ in God's redemptive plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who are chosen to be holy and blameless, indicating their identity and calling in Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_the_world.htm">The Foundation of the World</a></b><br>Refers to the creation of the world, underscoring the eternal nature of God's plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to encourage and instruct the early church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>Understand that God's choice of believers is rooted in His sovereign will and eternal purpose, not based on human merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Embrace your identity as chosen in Christ, which provides assurance and purpose in your Christian walk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_holiness.htm">Call to Holiness</a></b><br>Recognize that being chosen involves a call to live a holy and blameless life, reflecting God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Adopt an eternal perspective, knowing that God's plan for you was established before the foundation of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_motivation.htm">Love as Motivation</a></b><br>Let love be the motivation for living out your calling, as God's choice is rooted in His love for us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_1_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 1:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_1_4_How_does_it_inspire_holiness.htm">How does Ephesians 1:4 inspire you to live a holy life today?

This passage stands alone in St. Paul's Epistles in its use of this word "chosen" in connection with God's eternal purpose, "before the foundation of the world"--a phrase only applied elsewhere to the eternal communion of the Son with the Father (<a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>), and to the foreordaining of His sacrifice in the divine counsels (<a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>). The word "chosen" itself is used by our Lord of His choice of the Apostles (<a href="/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>; <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>; <a href="/context/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16-19</a>); but in one case with the significant addition, "one of you is a devil," showing that the election was not final. It is similarly used in the Acts (<a href="/acts/1-2.htm" title="Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:">Acts 1:2</a>; <a href="/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>; <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href="/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>; <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>; <a href="/acts/15-25.htm" title="It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,">Acts 15:25</a>) of His choice or the choice of the Apostles; and once (<a href="/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a>) of the national election of Israel. In <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1Corinthians 1:27-28</a> (the only other place where it is used by St. Paul), and in <a href="/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">James 2:5</a> it refers to choice of men by God's calling in this world. Clearly in all these cases it is applied to the election of men to privilege by an act of God's mercy here. In this passage, on the contrary, the whole reference is to the election "in Christ," by the foreknowledge of God, of those who should hereafter be made His members. From this examination of Scriptural usage it is clear that the visible election to privilege is constantly and invariably urged upon men; the election in God's eternal counsels only dwelt upon in passages which (like this or Romans 9, 11) have to ascend in thought to the fountain-head of all being in God's mysterious will. It will be observed that even here it clearly refers to all members of the Church, without distinction. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he chose us out</span>, or <span class="accented">selected us</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) <span class="accented">for himself</span> (middle voice).

We are here face to face with a profound mystery. Before even the world was founded, mankind presented themselves to God as lost; the work of redemption was planned and its details arranged from all eternity. Before such a mystery it becomes us to put the shoes from off our feet, and bow reverently before him whose "judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out." <span class="cmt_word">That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.</span> This is obviously the design of God's electing act; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x31;&#x46;&#x43;&#x30;&#x3b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> cannot denote the ground, but the purpose, of the choice. God did not choose some because he foresaw their holiness, but in order that they might become "holy and without blame." These two terms denote the positive and negative sides of purity: holy - possessed of all the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>); without blame, or blemish - marked by no stain or imperfection (see <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The terms do not denote justification, but a condition of sanctification which implies justification already bestowed, but goes beyond it; our justification is a step towards our complete final sanctification. This renewal being "before him," must be such as to bear the scrutiny of his eye; therefore not external or superficial merely, but reaching to the very heart and center of our nature (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The expression further denotes how it is of the very nature and glory of the new life to be spent in God's presence, our souls flourishing in the precious sunshine which ever beams out there from. For, when thus renewed, we do not fly from his presence like Adam (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), but delight in it (<a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>). Fear is changed to love (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); the loving relation between us and God is restored. It has been much disputed whether the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> ought to be construed with the fourth verse or with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the fifth. The weight of authority seems in favor of the latter; but we prefer the construction which is given both in the Authorized and the Revised Version, first, because if <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> qualified <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, it would come more naturally after it; and second, because the scope of the passage, the train of the apostle's thought, seems to require us to keep <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> in ver. 4. We never could come to be holy and without blemish before God unless the loving relations between us were restored (comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>, "Rooted and grounded in love"). The spirit of love, trust, admiration, directed to God helps our complete sanctification - changes us into the same image (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
