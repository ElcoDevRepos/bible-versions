The term "slaves" here refers to bondservants, who were often employed in various capacities, from household servants to skilled laborers. The instruction to "obey" aligns with the broader biblical theme of submission to authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, where Paul discusses submission to governing authorities. This directive does not endorse the institution of slavery but addresses the reality of the social structure at the time, encouraging Christian slaves to live out their faith within their circumstances.<p><b>with respect and fear</b><br>The phrase "respect and fear" suggests an attitude of reverence and honor towards those in authority. This mirrors the biblical principle of fearing God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. The respect and fear here are not rooted in terror but in a recognition of the authority structure established by God. This attitude is also reflected in <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, where servants are instructed to submit to their masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.<p><b>and sincerity of heart</b><br>"Sincerity of heart" implies a genuine and wholehearted approach to service, free from hypocrisy or ulterior motives. This aligns with <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>, where Paul similarly instructs slaves to obey their earthly masters with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. The call for sincerity reflects the Christian principle of integrity, where actions are consistent with inner beliefs and values. This sincerity is a reflection of the believer's relationship with Christ, who sees beyond outward actions to the heart's intentions.<p><b>just as you would obey Christ</b><br>The comparison to obeying Christ elevates the act of service to a spiritual level, suggesting that serving earthly masters is ultimately an act of worship to Christ. This parallels <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>, where believers are encouraged to work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men. The phrase underscores the Christian belief that all work, when done for the Lord, has eternal significance. It also reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, where serving others is equated with serving Christ Himself.

Rather than ignoring them, the Spirit speaks directly to believers who owned nothing yet belonged to Christ.

The slave is the servant of Christ in obeying his master, the master is a fellow-servant with his slave to the same Divine Lord. We notice on this particular subject a remarkable emphasis, and a singular closeness of parallelism between this Epistle and the Epistle to the Colossians; probably to be accounted for by the presence of Onesimus with St. Paul at the time, which would naturally press on him some special consideration of the relation of Christianity to slavery. Accordingly St. Paul's general attitude towards slavery will be best considered in the Epistle to Philemon (which see). Here it will be sufficient to note that while the institution, unnatural as it is, is left untouched, the declaration of a common fellowship in Christ enunciates a principle absolutely incompatible with slavery, and destined to destroy it.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Your masters</span> <span class= "bld">according to the flesh.</span>--This phrase (used also in <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>) at once implies the necessary limitation of all human slavery. It can subjugate and even kill the body, but it cannot touch the spirit; and it belongs only to the visible life of this world, not to the world to come. The slave is a man in spiritual and immortal being, not a "living tool" or "chattel," as even philosophy called him.<p><span class= "bld">With fear and trembling.</span>--The phrase is a favourite one with St. Paul. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1Corinthians 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Philippians 2:12</a>, in all which cases it is applied to the condition of man as man under the weight of solemn responsibility before God.) It recognises the "spirit of bondage unto fear" (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>) necessarily belonging to all who are "under law," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, under obedience to the will of another, as enforced upon them by compulsion; and this fear, moreover, is viewed as showing itself in "trembling" anxiety to obey. So St. Peter commands (<a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>), "Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward;" and it is to be noted that he describes the suffering herein implied as a fellowship with the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21-24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bond-servants, obey your masters according to the flesh.</span> There were many slaves in the early Church, but, however unjust their position, the apostle could not but counsel them to obedience, this course being the best for ultimately working out their emancipation. The words of Christ were peculiarly welcome to them "that labor and are heavy laden;" and, as we find from Celsus and others, the early Church was much ridiculed for the large number of uneducated persons in its pale. <span class="cmt_word">With fear and trembling.</span> Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>, from which it will be seen that this expression does not denote <span class="accented">slavish dread</span>, but <span class="accented">great moral anxiety lest one should fail in duty</span>.
