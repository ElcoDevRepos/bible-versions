In the biblical context, the early church was surrounded by pagan cultures where immoral practices were common. The Apostle Paul emphasizes the need for Christians to distance themselves from such practices, even in conversation. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching found in passages like <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, which encourages believers to focus on what is true, noble, and pure. The emphasis on shame reflects the biblical understanding of sin as something that separates humanity from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of man.<p><b>what the disobedient do in secret.</b><br>The "disobedient" refers to those who live contrary to God's commandments, often engaging in sinful behaviors that they attempt to hide. This secrecy suggests an awareness of wrongdoing, as seen in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where people love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. The cultural context of Ephesus, a city known for its idolatry and moral corruption, underscores the challenge for Christians to live righteously. The call to avoid even speaking of these deeds serves as a reminder of the transformative power of the Gospel, which calls believers to a higher standard of holiness, as reflected in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and pagan worship, which presented challenges for the early Christians living there.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, this early Christian community faced pressures from both pagan practices and false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_our_speech.htm">Guarding Our Speech</a></b><br>As believers, we must be cautious about what we discuss, ensuring our conversations are edifying and pure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often thrives in secrecy.
