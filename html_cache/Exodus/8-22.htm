It highlights the precision of God's actions and His ability to intervene in human affairs at His chosen moment. This timing is part of the larger narrative of the plagues, which serve as a demonstration of God's power over Egypt and its gods.<p><b>I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen</b><br>Goshen was the region in Egypt where the Israelites lived. This area was likely located in the eastern part of the Nile Delta. The special treatment signifies God's protection and favor towards His people, setting them apart from the Egyptians. This distinction underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminiscent of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>where My people live</b><br>The phrase "My people" reflects the covenant identity of the Israelites as God's chosen nation. This relationship is central to the narrative of Exodus, as God is fulfilling His promise to deliver His people from bondage. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as God's people through faith in Christ.<p><b>no swarms of flies will be found there</b><br>The absence of flies in Goshen serves as a miraculous sign of God's power and protection. Flies, likely representing a specific type of pestilence, were a common nuisance in ancient Egypt, often associated with disease and decay. This divine intervention not only protected the Israelites but also demonstrated God's sovereignty over creation, contrasting with the impotence of Egyptian deities.<p><b>In this way you will know that I, the LORD, am in the land</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's presence and active involvement in the world. It serves as a declaration of His supremacy over the gods of Egypt and His authority over the land. The phrase "I, the LORD" is a reminder of God's covenant name, Yahweh, which signifies His eternal and self-existent nature. This assurance of God's presence is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, ultimately fulfilled in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who is "God with us" (Emmanuel).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods through the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who acts as God's messenger to Pharaoh, demanding the release of the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go, prompting God to send plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, living in the land of Goshen, who are protected from the plagues affecting Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_goshen.htm">The Land of Goshen</a></b><br>A region in Egypt where the Israelites reside, set apart by God as a place of protection during the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God demonstrates His supreme authority over creation and the false gods of Egypt by controlling the plagues.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_separation.htm">Divine Protection and Separation</a></b><br>God sets apart His people, providing them with protection and distinguishing them from the Egyptians.

The "land of Goshen" can only have been some portion of the Eastern Delta, a tract in unwise different from the rest of Egypt--low, flat, well-watered, fertile.

It was an additional mark of the miraculous character of the visitations, well calculated to impress all thoughtful and honest minds. By all such it would be seen that the God who could make this severance was no local God of the Hebrews only, but one whose power extended over the whole earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/8-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But on that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
