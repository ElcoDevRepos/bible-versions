Bronze, a durable and strong metal, symbolizes judgment and endurance in biblical typology. The bronze mesh allowed for the ashes to fall through, facilitating the burning process. This construction detail reflects the practical needs of the sacrificial system, ensuring that the altar could function efficiently during the numerous offerings. The use of bronze also connects to other biblical instances where bronze is used in contexts of judgment, such as the bronze serpent in <a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>.<p><b>for the altar</b><br>The altar referred to here is the altar of burnt offering, central to the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law. It was located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle, where sacrifices were made to atone for the sins of the people. The altar's construction and use are detailed in <a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>, emphasizing its importance in Israelite worship. The altar serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the sacrificial system's requirements once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>under its ledge</b><br>The ledge of the altar provided a practical function, likely serving as a platform for the priests to stand on while performing sacrifices. This detail highlights the careful design of the altar, ensuring that it met the needs of the priests and the sacrificial rituals. The ledge's presence also indicates the altar's substantial size and the importance of its role in the Tabernacle's worship practices.<p><b>halfway up from the bottom</b><br>This specific measurement indicates the grate's position within the altar, ensuring optimal airflow and combustion for the sacrifices. The precise instructions for the altar's construction reflect the broader biblical theme of God's attention to detail and order, as seen throughout the instructions for the Tabernacle. This attention to detail underscores the holiness and sanctity of the worship practices, pointing to the need for reverence and obedience in approaching God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The chief artisan appointed by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the bronze altar and its grate.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_altar.htm">Bronze Altar</a></b><br>A key component of the Tabernacle used for burnt offerings, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grate_of_bronze.htm">Grate of Bronze</a></b><br>A network or mesh placed within the altar to support the offerings, allowing ashes to fall through and air to circulate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were commanded to construct the Tabernacle according to the divine specifications given to Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_bronze_altar.htm">Symbolism of the Bronze Altar</a></b><br>The altar represents the need for atonement and the seriousness of sin.
