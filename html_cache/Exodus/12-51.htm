The deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt occurred exactly as God had promised. This reflects God's sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. The phrase "that very day" underscores the culmination of the Passover event, which was a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the transition from slavery to freedom.<p><b>the LORD brought the Israelites</b><br>The use of "the LORD" (Yahweh) highlights the divine initiative and power in the deliverance. It was not by human effort but by God's mighty hand that the Israelites were freed. This act of deliverance is a central theme in the Old Testament, often recalled in later scriptures (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a>). It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual freedom from sin.<p><b>out of the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt, in biblical symbolism, often represents bondage and oppression. The exodus from Egypt is a foundational event for the Israelites, symbolizing liberation and the beginning of a covenant relationship with God. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of a Semitic presence in ancient Egypt, aligning with the biblical narrative. This exodus is a type of Christ's redemptive work, as He leads believers out of the bondage of sin.<p><b>by their divisions</b><br>The term "divisions" suggests an organized departure, possibly indicating tribal or family groups. This organization reflects God's order and structure within the community of His people. It also points to the military-like formation, preparing them for the journey ahead and the battles they would face. This orderly departure contrasts with the chaos of the plagues and the disarray of the Egyptians, highlighting God's control and provision for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and faithfulness by delivering His people from bondage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now being led to freedom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved for 430 years, representing a place of bondage and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divisions.htm">Divisions (Hebrew: ????????, "tsiv'ot")</a></b><br>Refers to the organized groups or hosts of the Israelites as they left Egypt, indicating order and structure in their departure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus_event.htm">The Exodus Event</a></b><br>The pivotal moment in Israel's history when God fulfilled His promise to deliver His people from slavery, marking the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God keeps His promises, as seen in the fulfillment of His covenant with Abraham.
