The locusts symbolize a divine judgment that will affect every level of Egyptian society, from Pharaoh's palace to the homes of common citizens. In the ancient Near East, locusts were a feared natural disaster due to their ability to devastate crops and cause famine. This plague serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, particularly those associated with agriculture and fertility, demonstrating the power of the God of Israel over the natural world.<p><b>something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they came into this land.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This emphasizes the unprecedented nature of the plague. The reference to "fathers" and "grandfathers" highlights the historical continuity and memory within Egyptian culture, suggesting that this event will be unparalleled in their collective experience. It underscores the severity of God's judgment and serves as a warning to Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's mighty acts being remembered through generations, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>, which speaks of declaring God's works to future generations.<p><b>Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh&#8217;s presence.</b><br>Moses' departure from Pharaoh's presence signifies the end of the warning and the beginning of the fulfillment of God's judgment. This action reflects Moses' role as God's prophet and messenger, delivering God's word with authority and then leaving the outcome to God. It also illustrates the hardened heart of Pharaoh, who remains unrepentant despite the clear warnings. This moment foreshadows the continued escalation of plagues and the eventual deliverance of the Israelites, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Modern travellers bear abundant witness to the same effect; as Burckhardt: "They overwhelm the province of Nedjd sometimes to such a degree that, having destroyed the harvest, they penetrate by thousands into the private dwellings, and devour whatsoever they can find, even the leather of the water vessels" (<span class= "ital">Notes,</span> vol. ii., p. 90). And Morier: "They entered the inmost recesses of the houses, were found in every corner, stuck to our clothes, and infected our food" (<span class= "ital">Second Journey,</span> p. 100). Kalisch is quite correct when he says: "Sometimes they penetrate into the houses; they fly into the mouths of the inmates; they throw themselves on the food; they gnaw leather, and even wood" (<span class= "ital">Commentary,</span> p. 123).<p><span class= "bld">Which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen.</span>--Only one notice of locusts has been found in the native records.<p><span class= "bld">He turned himself, and went out.</span>--It seems to be meant that Moses did not on this occasion wait to see what effect his menace would have on Pharaoh.

Compare <a href="/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>. The witness of modern travellers is to the same effect. Morier says "They entered the inmost recesses of the houses, were found in every corner, stuck to our clothes, and infested our food" (<span class="accented">Second Journey</span>, p. 100). Burckhardt observes - "They overwhelm the province of Nedjd sometimes to such a degree that, having destroyed the harvest, they penetrate by thousands into the private dwellings, and devour whatsoever they can find, even the leather of the water vessels" (<span class="accented">Notes</span>, vol. 2. p. 90). An older traveller, Beauplan, writes as follows: - "In June 1646, at Novgorod, it was prodigious to behold them, because they were hatched there that spring, and being as yet scarce able to fly, the ground was all covered, and the air so full of them that I could not eat in my chamber without a candle, all the houses being full of them, even the stables, barns, chambers, garrets, and cellars. I caused cannon-powder and sulphur to be burnt to expel them, but all to no purpose; for when the door Was opened, an infinite number came in, and the others went fluttering about; and it was a troublesome thing, when a man went abroad, to be hit on the face by those creatures, on the nose, eyes, or cheeks, so that there was no opening one's mouth but some would get in. Yet all this was nothing; for when we were to eat they gave us no respite; and when we went to cut a piece of meat, we cut a locust with it, and when a man opened his mouth to put in a morsel, he was sure to chew one of them." Oriental houses, it is to be borne in mind, have no better protection than lattice-work in the windows, so that locusts have free access to the apartments, even when the doers are shut. <span class="cmt_word">Which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen</span>. Inroads of locusts are not common in Egypt. Only one reference has been found to them in the native records. When they occur, they are as destructive as elsewhere. Denon witnessed one in the early part of the present century. Two others were witnessed by Carsten Niebuhr and Forskal in 1761 and 1762 (<span class="accented">Description de l'Arabie</span>, <span class="accented">p.</span> 148); and another by Tisehendorf comparatively recently. The meaning in the text is probably that no such visitation as that now sent had been seen previously, not that Egypt had been hitherto free from the scourge. <span class="cmt_word">He turned himself and went out</span>. Moses did not wait to learn what effect his announcement would have. He" knew "that Pharaoh would not fear the Lord.
