In the ancient Near Eastern context, shepherds were responsible for the safety of the flock. Predators such as lions, bears, and wolves were common threats. The law here acknowledges the reality of such dangers and provides a legal framework for dealing with them. This reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and fairness, recognizing circumstances beyond human control.<p><b>he shall bring it as evidence</b><br>The requirement to bring the torn carcass as evidence underscores the importance of accountability and integrity. It ensures that the shepherd is not falsely accused of negligence or theft. This practice is consistent with the biblical emphasis on truth and justice, as seen in other legal texts such as <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires the testimony of two or three witnesses to establish a matter. The physical evidence serves as a witness to the shepherd's claim.<p><b>he need not make restitution for the torn carcass</b><br>This provision exempts the shepherd from financial liability if he can prove that the loss was due to circumstances beyond his control. It reflects the biblical principle of mercy and fairness, recognizing that not all losses are due to negligence. This is similar to the principle found in <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, where unintentional harm is treated differently from premeditated actions.

Theft or loss through negligence called for restitution, but an attack by wild beasts lay outside human control.<p>&#8226; The law protects both owner and caretaker: it acknowledges the owner&#8217;s loss while recognizing that even diligent watchmen may face events only the Lord can fully prevent (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he shall bring it as evidence</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;he shall bring it as evidence&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/22-13.htm">Exodus 22:13</a>b)<p>&#8226; A tangible remnant&#8212;skin, bones, or carcass fragments&#8212;served as proof the story was true.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law values verifiable testimony (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).
