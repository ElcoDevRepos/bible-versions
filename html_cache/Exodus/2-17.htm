Conflicts over water rights were frequent, as seen in <a href="/genesis/26-20.htm">Genesis 26:20-22</a> with Isaac's wells. The shepherds' actions reflect a disregard for social justice, as they exploit their strength to oppress the daughters of Reuel, a Midianite priest. This incident highlights the vulnerability of women in ancient societies and sets the stage for Moses' intervention, which aligns with God's concern for justice and protection of the oppressed, as seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a>).<p><b>Moses rose up to help them</b><br>Moses' actions here foreshadow his future role as a deliverer of Israel. His willingness to stand against injustice and protect the vulnerable is a precursor to his leadership in liberating the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This act of courage and justice aligns with the character of God, who often raises leaders to defend the oppressed (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>). Moses' intervention is also a type of Christ, who stands as the ultimate deliverer and protector of His people (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>and watered their flock</b><br>By watering the flock, Moses not only provides immediate relief but also demonstrates servant leadership, a quality that will define his future role. This act of service is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching on leadership, where the greatest must be a servant (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>). The imagery of water is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing life, cleansing, and the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>). Moses' actions here can be seen as a reflection of God's provision and care for His people, a theme that will be evident in the wilderness wanderings when God provides water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who later becomes a central figure in leading the Israelites out of Egypt.

Scripture reports this matter-of-factly, underscoring a real historical moment. Similar interruptions appear in <a href="/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2&#8211;3</a> when shepherds gather at a well, and in <a href="/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15</a> the shepherds&#8217; conduct reveals character. Here, the newcomers represent a test of integrity&#8212;both theirs and Moses&#8217;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and drove them away</b><p>The verb is blunt: these men forcefully push the women back, exploiting their physical advantage. Such everyday injustice mirrors earlier oppression in <a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13&#8211;14</a> and anticipates Israel&#8217;s future conflicts (<a href="/numbers/22-6.htm">Numbers 22:6</a>; <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>). God&#8217;s Word shows that bullying is not merely ancient history; it is sin that still needs confronting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses rose up to help them</b><p>The phrase &#8220;rose up&#8221; signals decisive action. Moses, though a fugitive and stranger (<a href="/acts/7-29.htm">Acts 7:29</a>), will not stand idle. Like the &#8220;kinsman-redeemer&#8221; Boaz who acts on Ruth&#8217;s behalf (<a href="/ruth/2-9.htm">Ruth 2:9</a>), Moses demonstrates covenant kindness before Sinai&#8217;s laws are given. His impulse aligns with the moral order revealed later in <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22&#8211;24</a>&#8212;defend the vulnerable because the Lord defends them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and watered their flock</b><p>Moses finishes the job the women started, ensuring the sheep drink. Service follows courage; he acts, then completes the task. Jesus echoes this pattern in <a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14</a>&#8212;after taking initiative, He meets the need fully. Moses&#8217; servant leadership foreshadows his future role (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11&#8211;12</a>) and ultimately Christ&#8217;s, the greater Deliverer (<a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a> records a literal event where Moses intervenes when shepherds bully Jethro&#8217;s daughters. Each clause highlights: (1) injustice intrudes unexpectedly; (2) sinful aggression must be faced; (3) God&#8217;s people rise to defend the weak; and (4) true deliverers complete the work of care. The verse reveals Moses&#8217; emerging character and previews God&#8217;s redemptive pattern&#8212;courageous action coupled with humble service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The shepherds came.</span>--Those of the neighbourhood. The rule of the desert is that those who come to a well take their turns in the use of the water in the order of their arrival. But these rude shepherds declined to wait for their turn. It appears later on, by the question of Reuel, "How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?" that this rude and unfair conduct of the shepherds was habitual.<p><span class= "bld">Moses stood up and helped them.</span>--Moses is again the champion of the oppressed, but has learnt wisdom by the past, and uses no unnecessary violence. His air and manner intimidated the wrong-doers, and they allowed the maidens sheep to be watered first.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shepherds came and drove them away</span>. There is not much "natural politeness" among primitive peoples. The right of the stronger prevails, and women go to the wall. Even the daughters of their priest were not respected by these rude sons of the desert, who would not wait their turn, but used the water which Reners daughters had drawn. The context shows that this was not an accidental or occasional circumstance, but the regular practice of the shepherds, who thus day after day saved themselves the trouble of drawing. (See the next verse.) <span class="cmt_word">Moses stood up and helped them</span>. Ever ready to assist the weak against the strong (supra, vers. 12, 13), Moses "stood up" - sprang to his feet - and, though only one man against a dozen or a score, by his determined air intimidated the crowd of wrong-doers, and forced them to let the maidens' sheep drink at the troughs. His dress was probably that of an Egyptian of rank; and they might reasonably conclude from his boldness that he had attendants within call. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when some shepherds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
