The elders were respected leaders and representatives of the people, and their support was crucial for Moses' mission. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where God often works through established leadership structures. The elders' willingness to listen also fulfills God's promise of deliverance, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24-25</a>, where Joseph speaks of God's future intervention.<p><b>and you must go with them to the king of Egypt</b><br>Moses is instructed to approach Pharaoh not alone, but with the elders, signifying a united front. This approach underscores the communal aspect of Israel's plea and highlights the importance of collective leadership. The king of Egypt, or Pharaoh, was considered a god-like figure in Egyptian culture, making this confrontation a significant challenge. Historically, this reflects the political structure of ancient Egypt, where Pharaoh held absolute power.<p><b>and tell him, &#8216;The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.</b><br>This declaration identifies the God of Israel as distinct from the gods of Egypt. The term "Hebrews" connects the Israelites to their ancestral roots, emphasizing their identity as a people chosen by God. The phrase "has met with us" indicates a divine encounter, affirming God's active presence and guidance. This encounter is reminiscent of God's covenantal promises to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1-8</a>, where God establishes His covenant with Abraham.<p><b>Now please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness</b><br>The request for a three-day journey is a strategic move, possibly intended to test Pharaoh's willingness to allow the Israelites some freedom. The wilderness is often a place of testing and encounter with God, as seen later in Israel's history during their 40 years of wandering. This journey foreshadows the greater exodus to come, where the Israelites will leave Egypt entirely.<p><b>so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</b><br>Sacrifice is central to Israelite worship and signifies devotion and obedience to God. This request highlights the importance of worship and the need for a space free from Egyptian influence to properly honor God. Sacrifices were a means of maintaining the covenant relationship with God, as outlined in Leviticus. This act of worship prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the sacrificial system through His death and resurrection, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

For the fulfilment of the promise, see <a href="/context/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29-31</a>. The elders appear to have been persuaded easily, and at once.<p><span class= "bld">Thou and the elders.</span>--We are not told in Exodus 5 that the elders did present themselves before Pharaoh; but it is possible that they may have done so. Or Moses and Aaron, who spoke in their name, and by their authority, may have been regarded as sufficiently representing them.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews. </span>Pharaoh would readily comprehend this statement. He would quite understand that the Hebrews, being of a different race from the Egyptians, had a God of their own, and that this God would from time to time give intimations to them of His will. Such intimations were supposed to be given to the Egyptian kings occasionally by their gods.<p><span class= "bld">Three days' journey.</span>--The necessity for withdrawing to so great a distance arose from that remarkable peculiarity in the Egyptian religion, the worship of animals. Cows, or at any rate, white cows, were sacred throughout the whole of Egypt, and to kill them was regarded as a crime of the deepest dye. Sheep were sacred to the inhabitants of one nome or canton, goats to those of another (Herod. ii. 42). Unless the Hebrews retired to a place where there were no Egyptians, they would be unable to perform their sacred rites without danger of disturbance, and even bloodshed. (See below, <a href="/exodus/8-26.htm" title="And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?">Exodus 8:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness.</span>--"<span class= "ital">The </span>wilderness" to those who dwelt in Goshen was the broad sandy and rocky tract which intervened between Egypt and Palestine--the modern <span class= "ital">El-Tih</span>--a desert reckoned at three days' journey across (Herod. iii. 5). It is "a vast limestone plateau of irregular surface, projecting wedge-fashion into the peninsula of Sinai, just as Sinai itself projects into the Red Sea. It terminates in a long cliff or encampment, steep and abrupt on the south-western side, gradually falling away towards the south-east."--(<span class= "ital">Our Work in Palestine, </span>p. 275.)<p><span class= "bld">That we may sacrifice.</span>--It is idle to speculate whether, if Pharaoh had granted the request, the Israelites would have returned to Egypt after sacrificing. God knew that he would not grant it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall hearken to thy voice</span>. Moses thought they would despise him - turn a deaf ear to his words - look upon him as unworthy of credit. But it was not so. The hearts of men are in God's hands, and he disposed those of the elders to receive the message of his servant, Moses, favourably, and believe in it. (See <a href="/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29-31</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt come</span>, <span class="cmt_word">thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt</span>. This future is perhaps one of command rather than of prophetic announcement. The elders do not seem to have actually made their appearance before Pharaoh. (See <a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-4</a>.) They may, however, have authorised Moses and Aaron to speak in their name. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us</span>. Through our representative Moses. "Met with us" is undoubtedly the true meaning. <span class="cmt_word">That we may sacrifice</span>. There was reticence here, no doubt, but no falseness. It was a part of God's design that sacrifice, interrupted during the sojourn in Egypt for various reasons, should be resumed beyond the bounds of Egypt by His people. So much of his purpose, and no more, he bade Moses lay before Pharaoh on the first occasion. The object of the reticence was not to deceive Pharaoh, but to test him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[The elders of Israel] will listen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
