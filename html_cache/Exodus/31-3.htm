The Spirit of God is often associated with wisdom, understanding, and the ability to perform tasks beyond natural capabilities. This filling is reminiscent of the anointing of prophets, priests, and kings, such as David in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>. It signifies a special calling and purpose, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God equipping His people for His work.<p><b>with skill</b><br>The Hebrew word for "skill" here can also be translated as "wisdom." This is not merely technical ability but includes insight and discernment. In the context of the tabernacle's construction, it implies a God-given understanding of how to create objects that reflect divine beauty and order. This wisdom is akin to that given to Solomon for the building of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>).<p><b>ability</b><br>This term suggests competence and proficiency in executing tasks. It implies that the individual is not only knowledgeable but also capable of applying that knowledge effectively. This ability is a gift from God, ensuring that the work done is of the highest quality, reflecting God's own perfection and excellence.<p><b>and knowledge</b><br>Knowledge here refers to an understanding of materials, techniques, and processes necessary for craftsmanship. It is comprehensive, covering all aspects required for the task. This knowledge is divinely imparted, ensuring that the work aligns with God's specific instructions for the tabernacle, as detailed in earlier chapters of Exodus.<p><b>in all kinds of craftsmanship</b><br>This phrase encompasses a wide range of artistic and technical skills, including metalwork, woodwork, weaving, and embroidery. The craftsmanship required for the tabernacle was intricate and detailed, reflecting the glory and holiness of God. This mirrors the diversity of gifts within the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, where each member is equipped for different roles to build up the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle.
