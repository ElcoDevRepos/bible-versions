It signifies Pharaoh's resistance to God's will and serves as a demonstration of God's sovereignty over human decisions. The hardening can be seen as both a divine act and a result of Pharaoh's own stubbornness. This duality is reflected in earlier passages where Pharaoh hardens his own heart (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>) and where God declares He will harden Pharaoh's heart (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). This hardening is not merely a personal obstinacy but a fulfillment of God's plan to display His power and glory through the plagues and the eventual liberation of the Israelites.<p><b>and he would not let the Israelites go</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites is central to the narrative of the Exodus. It sets the stage for the series of plagues that God brings upon Egypt, each escalating in severity. This refusal highlights the conflict between God's command and human authority, illustrating the futility of resisting God's will. The Israelites' bondage in Egypt is symbolic of spiritual bondage, and their eventual liberation prefigures the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin.<p><b>just as the LORD had said through Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's word and the role of Moses as His prophet. God's foreknowledge and the reliability of His promises are emphasized here. Earlier in Exodus, God had informed Moses that Pharaoh would not easily let the Israelites go (<a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>). This fulfillment of prophecy serves to authenticate Moses' leadership and the divine origin of his mission. It also reinforces the theme of God's faithfulness and the certainty of His plans, which is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against letting the Israelites go, demonstrating his resistance to God's will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty through the plagues and the hardening of Pharaoh's heart.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, enslaved in Egypt, whom God intends to deliver.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God displayed His power through the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control, even over the hearts of rulers and nations.
