It underscores the intimate relationship between God and Moses, as seen throughout Exodus. This divine guidance is crucial for the Israelites' journey, emphasizing God's active role in their deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you crying out to Me?</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests that Moses, or possibly the Israelites through Moses, were in a state of desperation or seeking divine intervention. It highlights a moment of crisis at the Red Sea, where faith is being tested. The question implies that action, rather than continued prayer, is needed, reflecting a biblical principle that faith often requires stepping forward in trust.<p><b>Tell the Israelites to go forward.</b><br>This command is a call to action, urging the Israelites to move despite the apparent obstacle of the Red Sea. It demonstrates a test of faith, where obedience to God's command precedes the miracle of the sea parting. This forward movement is symbolic of faith in God's promises, paralleling other biblical instances where faith precedes divine intervention, such as Joshua leading the Israelites across the Jordan River. It also foreshadows the Christian journey of faith, where believers are called to move forward in trust, even when the path seems impossible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who guides and delivers His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are escaping slavery in Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites must cross to escape the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptian_army.htm">The Egyptian Army</a></b><br>The forces of Pharaoh, pursuing the Israelites to bring them back into slavery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>God's command to move forward comes at a moment of crisis.

God made answer that it was not a time to cry, but to act: "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward," &c. The Israelites were to strike their tents at once, and prepare for a forward movement. Moses was to descend to the edge of the sea, with his rod in his hand, and to stretch it out over the sea, and then await the consequences, which would be a "division" of the waters--the sea-bed would for a certain space become dry, and Israel would be able to cross to the other side (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm" title="But lift you up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the middle of the sea.">Exodus 14:16</a>); the Egyptians would follow, and then destruction would come upon them, and God would "get himself honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host" (<a href="/context/exodus/14-17.htm" title="And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.">Exodus 14:17-18</a>).

To the faithful prayer of Moses, albeit pitched perhaps in too low a key, God made gracious answer. A "cry" had been unnecessary, since his word was already pledged to bring his people safe to Canaan, and to get himself honour upon Pharaoh in connection with the pursuit (ver. 4). But, as the appeal has been made, he responds with a plain statement of what has now to be done: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The Israelites are to make themselves ready for a forward movement (ver. 15);
