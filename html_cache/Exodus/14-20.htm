The cloud served as a divine barrier, preventing the Egyptians from attacking the Israelites. This act of divine intervention highlights God's sovereignty and protection over His people. The positioning of the cloud between the two camps symbolizes God's role as a mediator and protector, a theme that is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5-8</a>, where God is described as the keeper and protector of Israel.<p><b>The cloud was there in the darkness,</b><br>The cloud's presence in the darkness signifies God's ability to provide guidance and protection even in the most challenging and uncertain times. This imagery of light in darkness is a recurring biblical theme, representing God's presence and guidance (e.g., <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, where the light shines in the darkness). The cloud's dual role as both a source of darkness for the Egyptians and light for the Israelites underscores the dual nature of God's justice and mercy.<p><b>but it lit up the night.</b><br>For the Israelites, the cloud provided illumination, allowing them to see and move forward. This miraculous provision of light is reminiscent of God's creation of light in <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a> and foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>. The light symbolizes hope, guidance, and the presence of God among His people, reinforcing the idea that God is with them in their journey.<p><b>So all night long neither camp went near the other.</b><br>The separation of the two camps by the cloud ensured the safety of the Israelites throughout the night. This divine intervention prevented any conflict or attack, allowing the Israelites to prepare for their crossing of the Red Sea. The phrase emphasizes God's control over the situation and His ability to protect His people from their enemies. This separation can also be seen as a type of the final separation of the righteous from the wicked, as described in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where God distinguishes between

The same pillar of cloud and fire that had guided them daily (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>) now shifts position.
