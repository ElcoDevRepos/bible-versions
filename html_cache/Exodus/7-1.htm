Throughout the Pentateuch, God frequently speaks to Moses, establishing him as a central figure in the narrative of Israel's deliverance. This divine communication underscores the importance of Moses as a mediator between God and His people, a role that foreshadows the ultimate mediator, Jesus Christ, as described in the New Testament (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh</b><br>Here, God elevates Moses' status in the eyes of Pharaoh, granting him authority and power that mirrors divine attributes. This is not to suggest that Moses becomes divine but rather that he acts as God's representative. In the ancient Near Eastern context, Pharaohs were often considered gods or semi-divine figures, so this statement subverts the Egyptian belief system by positioning Moses, a Hebrew, as superior. This prefigures the ultimate authority of Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, and who exercises authority over all earthly powers (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>and your brother Aaron will be your prophet</b><br>Aaron's role as a prophet to Moses highlights the importance of prophetic ministry in communicating God's will. In this context, Aaron serves as the spokesperson, conveying Moses' messages to Pharaoh. This arrangement reflects the broader biblical theme of God using prophets to speak to His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The prophetic office finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate prophet, priest, and king, revealing God's will perfectly (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). Aaron's role also emphasizes the importance of partnership and support in ministry, a principle seen in the New Testament with the apostles and early church leaders working together to spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is orchestrating the deliverance of His people from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, who is empowered by God to confront Pharaoh and demand the release of the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who is seen as a god in his own right by the Egyptians, yet is about to witness the power of the true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who serves as his spokesperson or prophet, communicating God's messages to Pharaoh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and the setting for the unfolding of God's mighty acts of deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_empowerment.htm">Divine Empowerment</a></b><br>God equips those He calls.

The verse underscores that when God sends, He equips; when He calls, He clarifies; and when He confronts evil powers, He does so through willing, obedient servants who embody His word and will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh . . . --</span>This is God's answer to the objection of Moses that his lips were uncircumcised (<a href="/exodus/6-12.htm" title="And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not listened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?">Exodus 6:12</a>), and probably followed it immediately.

He made allowance, and raised his courage and his spirits by fresh promises, and by a call upon him for immediate action. The process of deliverance, God assured him, was just about to begin. Miracles would be wrought until Pharaoh's stubbornness was overcome. He was himself to begin the series at once by casting his rod upon the ground, that it might become a serpent (ver. 9). From this point Moses' diffidence wholly disappears. Once launched upon his Heaven-directed course, assured of his miraculous powers, committed to a struggle with the powerful Egyptian king, he persevered without blenching or wavering until success crowned his efforts. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thee a god to Pharaoh</span>. Moses was diffident of appearing a second time before Pharaoh, who was so much his worldly superior. God reminds him that he is in truth very much Pharaoh's superior. If Pharaoh has earthly, he has unearthly power. He is to Pharaoh "as a god," with a right to command his obedience, and with strength to enforce his commands. <span class="cmt_word">Aaron shall be thy prophet</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "thy spokesman" - the interpreter of thy will to others.
