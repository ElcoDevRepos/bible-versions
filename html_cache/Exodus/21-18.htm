In the ancient Near Eastern context, disputes could arise over various issues such as property, honor, or personal grievances. The Mosaic Law provided guidelines to address such conflicts, emphasizing justice and restitution. This reflects the broader biblical principle of resolving disputes within the community, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where Jesus outlines steps for reconciliation.<p><b>and one strikes the other with a stone or a fist</b><br>The use of a stone or a fist suggests an escalation from verbal to physical violence. In ancient Israel, stones were common tools and weapons, and fists represent personal combat. This phrase highlights the seriousness of the altercation, as physical harm is inflicted. The law here serves to regulate and mitigate violence, ensuring that justice is served without excessive retribution, aligning with the principle of "an eye for an eye" found in <a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, which aims to limit vengeance.<p><b>and he does not die but is confined to bed</b><br>This outcome indicates a non-lethal injury that results in temporary incapacitation. The law distinguishes between different levels of harm, with varying consequences. The focus here is on the victim's recovery and the responsibility of the aggressor. This reflects the biblical theme of justice tempered with mercy, as seen in the broader context of the Mosaic Law, which seeks to balance punishment with the opportunity for restitution and healing. The emphasis on the victim's condition underscores the value of human life and well-being, a principle echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized compassion and care for others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_quarreling.htm">Men Quarreling</a></b><br>This refers to individuals engaged in a dispute or conflict.

If death ensues in such a case, the crime is, of course, murder or manslaughter, according to the attendant circumstances; but if death does not ensue, it is aggravated assault only. In such cases punishment could not be inflicted by retaliation--the usual penalty under the Mosaic Law (<a href="/context/exodus/21-24.htm" title="Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,">Exodus 21:24-25</a>)--without a risk of killing the man, which would have been an excessive punishment. The law therefore imposed a fine, which was to be fixed at such an amount as would at once compensate the sufferer for the loss of his time (<a href="/exodus/21-19.htm" title="If he rise again, and walk abroad on his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.">Exodus 21:19</a>), and defray the cost of his cure.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">With a stone, or with his fist.</span>--Comp. The difference made under the English law between wounding with a sharp or a blunt instrument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19</span> - <span class="accented">Severe assault</span>. Assault was punishable by the law in two ways. Ordinarily, the rule was that of strict retaliation' ' Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe" (vers. 24, 25; compare <a href="/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). But where the assault was severe, causing a man to take to his bed, and call in the physician' s aid, something more was needed. The Rabbinical commentators tell us that in this case he was arrested, and sent to prison until it was ascertained whether the person hurt would die or no. If he died, the man was tried for murder; if he recovered, a fine was imposed. This was axed at such a sum as would at once compensate the injured man for his loss of time and defray the expense of his cure. A similar principle is adopted under our own law in many cases of civil action. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If men strive together</span>. If there is a quarrel and a personal encounter. In our own law this would reduce this offence, if death ensued, to manslaughter. <span class="cmt_word">With a stone, or with his fist</span>. The use of either would show absence of premeditation, and of any design to kill. A weapon would have to be prepared beforehand: a stone might be readily caught up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
