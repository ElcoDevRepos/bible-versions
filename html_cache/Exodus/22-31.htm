The concept of holiness is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God commands, "Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy." This call to holiness is not just about ritual purity but encompasses moral and ethical behavior, distinguishing the Israelites from surrounding nations. The idea of being God's people is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>), where God promises to be the God of Abraham's descendants. This identity as God's holy people is fulfilled in the New Testament through the church, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are described as "a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation."<p><b>You must not eat the meat of a mauled animal found in the field;</b><br>This command reflects the dietary laws given to Israel, which are part of the broader holiness code. Eating meat from an animal that died naturally or was killed by other animals was prohibited because it was considered unclean (<a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>). This law served both hygienic purposes and symbolized the separation from death and decay, which are contrary to God's nature. The prohibition also underscores the importance of respecting life and the proper handling of food, which is a recurring theme in the Mosaic Law. In a broader sense, it points to the need for discernment and purity in what the people of God consume, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>you are to throw it to the dogs.</b><br>In ancient Israel, dogs were not typically domesticated pets but were often scavengers. The instruction to throw the meat to the dogs indicates that what is unfit for God's holy people is suitable only for animals considered unclean. This act of discarding the meat to dogs reinforces the separation between the holy and the profane. It also serves as a practical solution for disposing of the carcass, ensuring that the Israelites maintain their ritual purity. The mention of dogs can also be seen as a metaphor for those outside the covenant community, as in <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>, where Jesus uses the term to describe Gentiles in a cultural context. This highlights the distinction between those who are part of God's covenant and those who are not, a theme that runs throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>- The speaker of the command, emphasizing His covenant relationship with the Israelites and His desire for them to be set apart as holy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The recipients of the command, called to live as God's holy people, distinct from surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mauled_animal.htm">Mauled Animal</a></b><br>- Represents unclean or defiled food, which the Israelites are instructed to avoid to maintain their holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dogs.htm">Dogs</a></b><br>- Symbolic of impurity in ancient Israelite culture, often associated with uncleanliness and scavenging.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_as_a_distinctive_mark.htm">Holiness as a Distinctive Mark</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy, which means being set apart for His purposes.

Peter applies the same principle to the church in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, reminding believers that holiness remains God&#8217;s unchanging standard.<p>&#8226; Practically, holiness touches every arena of life&#8212;worship, family, justice, diet&#8212;because God&#8217;s ownership covers everything (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the verse invites self-examination: are our daily choices visibly different because we belong to Him?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must not eat the meat of a mauled animal found in the field</b><p>&#8226; The command, &#8220;You must not eat the meat of a mauled animal found in the field&#8221;, addresses carcasses torn by predators.<p>&#8211; Such meat still contains blood; consuming it violates God&#8217;s earlier prohibition of eating blood (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>).<p>&#8211; It is likely to carry disease or decay, endangering health&#8212;a practical expression of God&#8217;s protective love.<p>&#8211; Eating it would blur the moral distinction between Israel and the nations that ignored God&#8217;s dietary boundaries (<a href="/leviticus/20-25.htm">Leviticus 20:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; A similar prohibition is repeated in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a> and referenced for Gentile believers in <a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>, showing the enduring concern for purity and respect for life.<p>&#8226; Obedience here is not mere ritual; it is an act of trust that God&#8217;s way is both morally and physically good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are to throw it to the dogs</b><p>&#8226; Rather than leave the carcass to tempt someone else, Israel was told &#8220;you are to throw it to the dogs&#8221;.<p>&#8211; Dogs were unclean scavengers (<a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>). Giving the carcass to them prevented waste yet maintained human sanctity.<p>&#8211; In Scripture, &#8220;dogs&#8221; often symbolize what is outside covenant blessing (<a href="/exodus/11-7.htm">Exodus 11:7</a> contrasts Israel&#8217;s safety; <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a> uses &#8220;dogs&#8221; for false teachers; <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a> warns against giving holy things to dogs).<p>&#8226; The instruction reinforces the boundary: what is unsuitable for God&#8217;s people can be handed over to what is unclean, but never the reverse.<p>&#8226; By discarding the carcass, Israel demonstrated that obedience mattered more than squeezing value from every resource&#8212;a mindset echoed when Paul counts all things loss &#8220;for the surpassing worth of knowing Christ&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a> ties identity to action. Because God owns His people, He commands visible holiness&#8212;even in the mundane matter of food. Refusing carcass meat and tossing it to dogs preserved health, honored life, and signposted Israel&#8217;s distinct calling. The principle endures: believers who know they belong to a holy God showcase that holiness in everyday choices, trusting that His boundaries are always for their good and His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Ye shall be holy men unto me.</span>--Compare <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

Outward ordinances could not effect this; but, to keep the thought perpetually before- men's minds, a network of external obligations was devised, whereof a specimen is given in the law which follows. The flesh of an animal torn by a carnivorous beast would be doubly unclean: (1) By contact with the unclean carnivorous beast; and (2) through not having all the blood properly drained from it. It was therefore not to be eaten by a Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall cast it to the dogs</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>ye shall do this rather than eat it. The flesh might probably be given, or even sold, to an alien.

One such law then follows - <span class="accented">Law against eating the flesh of an animal killed by another</span>. The blood of such an animal would not be properly drained from it.
