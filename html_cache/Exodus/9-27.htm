This is during the seventh plague, hail, which devastated Egypt. Pharaoh's action reflects a temporary acknowledgment of the power of the God of Israel. Historically, Egyptian rulers were seen as divine or semi-divine, making this act of summoning foreign leaders significant. It shows a crack in Pharaoh's perceived invincibility and divine status.<p><b>&#8220;This time I have sinned,&#8221; he said.</b><br>Pharaoh's admission of sin is notable, as it is rare for a ruler of his stature to confess wrongdoing. In the context of the plagues, this statement marks a moment of apparent repentance. However, it is important to note that Pharaoh's heart is described as hardened throughout the narrative, suggesting that this confession may be insincere or temporary. This phrase can be compared to other instances in scripture where leaders acknowledge sin but do not fully repent, such as King Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD is righteous,</b><br>Pharaoh's acknowledgment of the LORD's righteousness contrasts with his own actions and those of his people. The term "righteous" in the biblical context refers to God's just and moral nature. This statement aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>. It highlights the moral and ethical standards that God upholds, which Pharaoh and the Egyptians have violated.<p><b>and I and my people are wicked.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Pharaoh admits to the wickedness of both himself and his people. This collective acknowledgment of sin underscores the corporate nature of sin in the biblical narrative, where leaders and their nations are often seen as intertwined in their moral standing. The term "wicked" denotes a departure from God's laws and standards. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of repentance and the need for turning away from sin, as seen in the calls for national repentance in books like Jonah and Joel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who is experiencing the plagues sent by God as a result of his refusal to let the Israelites go.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and spokesperson, who assists Moses in confronting Pharaoh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is demonstrating His power and righteousness through the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where the plagues are occurring.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_vs._repentance.htm">Acknowledgment vs. Repentance</a></b><br>Pharaoh's admission of sin is a step, but true repentance requires a change of heart and action.

Now the piling-up of judgments corners him into admitting fault.<p>&#8226; Superficial confession has old precedents: Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-34.htm">Numbers 22:34</a>) and King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>) both uttered similar words without lasting change.<p>&#8226; Genuine repentance involves turning from sin and trusting God (<a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>; <a href="/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>). Pharaoh will retract his confession once relief comes (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34-35</a>), proving it was sorrow for consequences, not for sin (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The LORD is righteous&#8221;</b><p>A pagan monarch declares God&#8217;s perfect justice&#8212;an involuntary testimony to the truth.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently proclaims the LORD&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). Even adversaries must acknowledge it (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Each plague vindicates God&#8217;s character: His judgments are neither random nor excessive but measured responses to hardened opposition (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s statement also highlights the moral divide: the righteous God versus the unrighteous oppressor (<a href="/psalms/99-4.htm">Psalm 99:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and I and my people are wicked.&#8221;</b><p>Pharaoh shifts from personal guilt to national guilt.<p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s collective participation in enslaving Israel (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>) makes them &#8220;wicked.&#8221; Comparable corporate confessions appear later in Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/ezra/9-15.htm">Ezra 9:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Admitting wickedness is a crucial first step (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>), yet Pharaoh never follows through with obedience and faith, revealing a hardened heart still under judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His fleeting humility illustrates <a href="/proverbs/28-14.htm">Proverbs 28:14</a>&#8212;blessing rests on those who fear God continually; hardness invites calamity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a> records a moment when relentless divine judgment squeezes Pharaoh into confessing, &#8220;I have sinned.

This may have been partly because it caused destruction of human life, partly on account of its extraordinary and awful character. It must be borne in mind that the storm was still continuing, and gave no sign of coming to a natural end (<a href="/exodus/9-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know how that the earth is the LORD's.">Exodus 9:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-33.htm" title="And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.">Exodus 9:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I have sinned this time</span>--i.e., This time I confess that I have sinned in resisting Jehovah; I do not any more maintain that I have acted right.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord is righteous.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Jehovah is the Just One</span>--a form of speech implying that Jehovah, <span class= "ital">and He alone,</span> was just.<p><span class= "bld">Wicked.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the sinners.</span> "I and my people" stand in contrast with God and His people. Previously Pharaoh had denounced the Israelites as idlers and hypocrites (<a href="/exodus/5-8.htm" title="And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you shall lay on them; you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.">Exodus 5:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-17.htm" title="But he said, You are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.">Exodus 5:17</a>); now he admits that it is only he and his people that are to blame. The confession is satisfactory, except in so far as it divides between Pharaoh and the Egyptians the blame which was almost wholly his. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-35.</span> - The plague of hail impressed the Pharaoh more than any previous one. It was the first which had inflicted death on men. It was a most striking and terrible manifestation. It was quite unlike anything which the Egyptians had ever experienced before (vers. 18, 24). It was, by manifest miracle, made to fall on the Egyptians only (ver. 26). Pharaoh was therefore more humbled than ever previously. He acknowledged that he "had sinned" (ver. 27); he added a confession that "Jehovah [alone] was righteous, he and his people wicked" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). And, as twice before, he expressed his willingness to let the Israelites take their departure if the plague were removed (ver. 28). The ultimate results, however, were not any better than before. No sooner had Moses prayed to God, and procured the cessation of the plague, than the king repented of his repentance, "hardened his heart;" and, once more casting his promise to the winds, refused to permit the Israelites to depart (vers. 33-35). His people joined him in this act of obduracy (ver. 34), perhaps thinking that they had now suffered the worst that could befall them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh sent</span>. Compare <a href="/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>, and 25-28. Pharaoh had been driven to entreat only twice before. <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned this time</span>. The meaning is, "I acknowledge this time that I have sinned" (Kaliseh, Cook). <span class="accented">"I</span> do not any longer maintain that my conduct has been right." The confession is made for the first time, and seems to have been extorted by the terrible nature of the plague, which, instead of passing off, like most storms, continued. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is righteous</span>, etc. Literally, "Jehovah is <span class="accented">the</span> Just One; and I and my people are <span class="accented">the</span> sinners."
