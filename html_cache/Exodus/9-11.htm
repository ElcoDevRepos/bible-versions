This signifies the superiority of God's power over Egyptian magic and deities. In earlier chapters, these magicians were able to mimic some of the plagues, but their inability to stand before Moses here highlights the progression of God's judgment and the futility of opposing Him. This moment foreshadows the ultimate defeat of all who oppose God's will, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>.<p><b>because the boils had broken out on them</b><br>The boils represent the sixth plague sent by God upon Egypt. This affliction was not only painful but also rendered the magicians ceremonially unclean, preventing them from performing their duties. The Hebrew word for "boils" suggests inflamed, ulcerous sores, which would have been both physically debilitating and socially isolating. This plague demonstrates God's control over health and disease, contrasting with the Egyptian belief in their gods' protective powers.<p><b>and on all the Egyptians</b><br>The widespread nature of the boils emphasizes the comprehensive reach of God's judgment. Unlike previous plagues that affected specific areas or groups, this one impacts all Egyptians, signifying that no one is exempt from God's authority. This universal affliction serves as a precursor to the final plague, the death of the firstborn, which ultimately leads to the liberation of the Israelites.
