It echoes God's assurance to other leaders like Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>) and is fulfilled in the New Testament with Jesus' promise to be with His followers always (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The phrase underscores God's commitment to His people and His active role in their deliverance and guidance.<p><b>God said,</b><br>This direct communication from God to Moses highlights the personal relationship God establishes with His chosen leaders. It reflects the unique role of Moses as a prophet and mediator between God and Israel. The divine speech acts as a powerful affirmation of Moses' mission and authority.<p><b>and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you:</b><br>Signs in the Bible often serve as confirmations of God's word and promises. Here, the sign is not immediate but future-oriented, requiring faith and obedience from Moses. It points to the fulfillment of God's plan and the assurance that His promises will come to pass.<p><b>When you have brought the people out of Egypt,</b><br>This phrase anticipates the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history that signifies liberation and God's power over oppressive forces. It foreshadows the plagues, the Passover, and the crossing of the Red Sea, all of which demonstrate God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>all of you will worship God on this mountain.</b><br>The mountain referred to is Mount Sinai, a significant location where God would later give the Law to Israel (Exodus 19-20). Worship here signifies not just ritual acts but a covenantal relationship with God. This event prefigures the establishment of Israel as a nation under God's law and points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who establishes a new covenant through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian.

The "sign" was one which appealed to faith only, like that given to Hezekiah by Isaiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a>), but, if accepted, it gave a full assurance - the second step involved the first - the end implied the means - if Moses was of a certainty to bring the Israelites to Sinai, he must first lead them out of Egypt - he must in some way or other triumph over all the difficulties which would beset the undertaking. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I will surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;eh&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with you,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
