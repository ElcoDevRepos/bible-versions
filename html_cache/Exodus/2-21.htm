The "man" refers to Reuel, also known as Jethro, a priest of Midian. This agreement signifies Moses' acceptance of a new life away from Egypt, highlighting a period of preparation and transformation. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, indicating a shared heritage with Moses. This connection may have facilitated Moses' acceptance into Jethro's household. The act of staying with Jethro symbolizes a divine provision and protection for Moses during his exile.<p><b>and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage</b><br>Jethro's giving of his daughter Zipporah to Moses signifies a formal alliance and acceptance into the Midianite community. In ancient Near Eastern culture, marriage often involved familial alliances and was a means of securing social and economic stability. Zipporah's marriage to Moses also foreshadows the blending of cultures and peoples that will occur as the Israelites journey to the Promised Land. This union is significant as it introduces Zipporah, who plays a crucial role in Moses' life, particularly in the episode of circumcising their son, which underscores the importance of covenantal faithfulness. The marriage can also be seen as a type of Christ's union with the Church, where Christ, like Moses, takes a bride from among the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who fled Egypt after killing an Egyptian.

Moses consented, and in course of time took to wife Zipporah, one of Reuel's daughters. Marriage with the Midianites was allowed, even under the Law. It has been conjectured that Reuel might have communicated to Moses traditions, or even documents concerning their common ancestor, Abraham, and his family. But there is nothing to indicate the use of letters at this early date by the Midianites.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses was content to dwell with the man</span>. Moses had fled from Egypt without any definite plan, simply to save his life, and had now to determine how he would obtain a subsistence. Received into Reuel's house, or tent, pleased with the man and with his family, he consented to stay with him, probably entered into his service, as Jacob into Laban's (<a href="/genesis/29-15.htm">Genesis 29:15-20</a>), kept his sheep, or otherwise made himself useful (see <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>); and in course of time Reuel <span class="cmt_word">gave Moses his daughter</span>, accepted him for his son-in-law, so that he became not merely a member of his household, but of his family, was adopted probably into the tribe, so that he could not quit it without permission (<a href="/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18</a>), and, so far as his own intention went, cast in his lot with the Midianites, with whom he meant henceforth to live and die. Such vague ideas as he may previously have entertained of his "mission" had passed away; he had been "disillusioned" by his ill-success, and now looked forward to nothing but a life of peaceful obscurity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">agreed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
