This lampstand was made of pure gold and had seven branches, symbolizing perfection and completeness. The lighting of the lamps was a daily ritual performed by the priests, signifying the presence of God&#8217;s light among His people. The lamps were to burn continually, representing God's eternal presence and guidance. This act of setting up the lamps is a reminder of the light of God that guides His people, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." The menorah also prefigures Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, indicating that He is the ultimate source of spiritual illumination.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's instructions. Throughout the construction and setting up of the Tabernacle, Moses followed God's commands precisely, demonstrating faithfulness and reverence. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the necessity of following God's will. In the broader biblical narrative, obedience to God is often linked to blessings and the fulfillment of His promises, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The phrase also underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where adherence to His commands was a sign of their commitment and devotion. This obedience is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of following God's commandments as an expression of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
