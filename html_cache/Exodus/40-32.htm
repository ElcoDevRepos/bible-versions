The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and God's dwelling among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This washing ritual underscores the importance of cleanliness and purity in worship, reflecting the holiness required to enter God's presence. The priests, specifically Aaron and his sons, were required to wash their hands and feet, signifying the need for spiritual cleanliness. This practice foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on inner purity and the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><b>or approached the altar</b><br>The altar was the place of sacrifice, where offerings were made to atone for sin and express devotion to God. Approaching the altar required ceremonial cleanliness, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement. This practice points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the sacrificial system by offering Himself as the perfect and final atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). The altar's significance in the Old Testament worship system is a type of Christ's redemptive work on the cross.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's commands, a recurring theme in the relationship between God and Israel. Moses, as the mediator of the covenant, received direct instructions from God, which were to be followed precisely. This obedience is crucial for maintaining the covenant relationship and receiving God's blessings. The detailed instructions given to Moses reflect God's desire for order and holiness in worship. This obedience to divine command is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law and calls His followers to live in accordance with His teachings (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive the Law, including the instructions for the Tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and his sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, appointed by God to serve in the Tabernacle and perform the rituals and sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Also known as the Tabernacle, this was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where He would meet with Moses and the priests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place where sacrifices were made to God, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_command.htm">The LORD's Command</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to Moses regarding the construction and use of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the requirement for ceremonial washing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The priests' washing was an act of obedience to God's command.

They came again and again, showing our continual need for repentance and renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting</b><p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a> commands that the priests &#8220;enter the Tent of Meeting &#8230; so that they will not incur guilt and die.&#8221; Cleansing was not occasional; it was every entrance.<p>&#8211; <a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a> notes the high priest entered &#8220;once a year&#8221; on the Day of Atonement, but every approach, however frequent or rare, was preceded by washing.<p>&#8211; <a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6</a> recalls the regular priestly duties behind the first curtain, illustrating how repetitive ministry still demanded persistent purity.<p>&#8226; Application: service routine can dull our sense of need, yet the text insists that each time we come before the Lord&#8212;in worship, prayer, or ministry&#8212;we pause for cleansing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or approached the altar</b><p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a> repeats that the priests must wash &#8220;when they approach the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5-9</a> shows the priest handling sacrifices; without washing he could not touch what symbolized atonement.<p>&#8211; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> shifts the altar imagery to believers: &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice.&#8221; The pattern holds&#8212;approach calls for purity.<p>&#8211; <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat,&#8221; pointing to Christ as the true altar and underscoring that washed hearts alone can enjoy that privilege.<p>&#8226; Insight: the washing basin stood between tent and altar; no shortcut existed. Every act of worship or service flows through cleansing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42-43</a> records that Moses inspected all the work and saw it was done &#8220;just as the LORD had commanded.&#8221; Obedience authenticates worship.<p>&#8211; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> warns against adding to or subtracting from God&#8217;s commands; washing exactly as directed displayed reverence for His word.<p>&#8211; <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> teaches that &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice,&#8221; so even the sacrificial system depended on prior obedience.<p>&#8211; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a> echoes the same heart: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Reflection: the verse links holiness to heeding God&#8217;s voice. The priests&#8217; compliance models the obedient faith God still seeks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/40-32.htm">Exodus 40:32</a> shows priests who paused at the basin every time they stepped toward God&#8217;s dwelling or His altar. The simple rhythm&#8212;wash, enter; wash, sacrifice&#8212;preaches a timeless message. God invites His people close, yet never at the cost of His holiness. Continual cleansing, constant awareness of His presence, and careful obedience to His revealed word remain the pathway for all who would minister before Him today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/40-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They washed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7364.htm">Strong's 7364: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wash, wash off or away, bathe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whenever they entered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
