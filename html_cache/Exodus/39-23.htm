The opening in the center signifies the practical design for ease of wearing, allowing the robe to be slipped over the head. This design reflects the functional aspect of priestly garments, which were meant to facilitate the duties of the priesthood. The central opening also symbolizes the centrality of the priest's role in mediating between God and the Israelites, pointing to the ultimate mediator, Jesus Christ, who is central to the New Covenant.<p><b>like that of a garment</b><br>This phrase indicates that the robe's construction was similar to common garments of the time, suggesting that while the priestly garments were unique in their sacred purpose, they were not entirely alien to the everyday life of the Israelites. This connection to common garments underscores the idea that the priesthood was meant to be relatable and accessible, foreshadowing the incarnation of Christ, who took on human form to relate to humanity.<p><b>with a collar around the opening</b><br>The collar around the opening served both a practical and symbolic purpose. Practically, it reinforced the garment, preventing it from tearing, which would render it unfit for sacred use. Symbolically, the collar represents the completeness and perfection required in the service of God, as any imperfection would be unacceptable. This mirrors the sinless nature of Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly and serves as our eternal high priest.<p><b>so that it would not tear</b><br>The instruction to prevent tearing highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of the priestly garments. In biblical symbolism, tearing often represents mourning or judgment (as seen in the tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion). The untearable nature of the robe signifies the enduring and unbreakable covenant between God and His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, whose sacrifice established a new and everlasting covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and the making of the priestly garments, including the robe mentioned in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites, for which the priestly garments were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The primary wearer of the robe described in this verse, who served as the mediator between God and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, for whom the Tabernacle and the priestly garments were constructed as part of their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_detail_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Detail in Worship</a></b><br>The specific instructions for the robe's construction remind us that God values detail and precision in our worship practices.
