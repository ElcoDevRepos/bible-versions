In the context of Exodus, God often speaks directly to Moses, establishing Moses as His chosen leader and mediator between God and the Israelites.<p><b>Go down and bring Aaron with you</b><br>Aaron is specifically mentioned, highlighting his role as Moses' brother and future high priest. This foreshadows Aaron's significant role in the priesthood and the establishment of the Levitical order. It also underscores the importance of leadership and the need for a mediator between God and His people.<p><b>But the priests and the people must not break through</b><br>This command underscores the holiness of God and the separation between the divine and the human. The priests, though set apart for service, are still not permitted to approach God without His explicit invitation. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for reverence and obedience.<p><b>to come up to the LORD</b><br>The mountain represents God's presence, and only those whom God calls may approach. This is a precursor to the tabernacle and temple systems, where access to God's presence is restricted and mediated through the priesthood, pointing to the need for a mediator.<p><b>or He will break out against them</b><br>This warning highlights the seriousness of approaching God improperly. It reflects the biblical principle that God's holiness cannot be violated without consequence. This anticipates the sacrificial system and ultimately points to the necessity of Christ's atoning work, which allows believers to approach God with confidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and sets boundaries for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to mediate between Him and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who is to accompany Moses up the mountain, signifying his future role as high priest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Those who serve in religious duties, yet are not permitted to ascend the mountain at this time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The holy mountain where God reveals Himself and gives the Law to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_god.htm">Holiness of God</a></b><br>God's holiness requires boundaries.
