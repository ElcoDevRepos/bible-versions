Moses serves as a mediator between God and the Israelites, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The personal nature of God's communication underscores Moses' unique prophetic role.<p><b>Behold, I will come to you in a dense cloud</b><br>The dense cloud signifies God's presence and is a common motif in theophanies, where God reveals Himself to humanity. This cloud represents both God's immanence and His transcendence, as it conceals His full glory, which is too overwhelming for humans to behold (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The cloud also connects to the pillar of cloud that guided the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>).<p><b>so that the people will hear when I speak with you</b><br>This ensures that the Israelites recognize Moses' authority as divinely appointed. The audible voice of God serves as a confirmation of Moses' leadership and the authenticity of his message. This public revelation is crucial for establishing the covenant at Sinai.<p><b>and they will always put their trust in you</b><br>The trust in Moses is foundational for the Israelites' journey and their acceptance of the Law. This trust is not just in Moses as a leader but in the God who speaks through him. It foreshadows the trust believers are called to place in Christ, who fulfills the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>And Moses relayed to the LORD what the people had said</b><br>This demonstrates Moses' role as an intercessor, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). It also reflects the covenant relationship where communication between God and His people is facilitated through a mediator.

Even when He reveals Himself. He still "dwells in the thick darkness" (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-1.htm" title="Then said Solomon, The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.">2Chronicles 6:1</a>). It is absolutely necessary that He should be closely veiled when He draws near to men, for otherwise they could not endure for a moment "the brightness of His presence." (See <a href="/exodus/40-35.htm" title="And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud stayed thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:35</a> :<a href="/2_chronicles/5-14.htm" title="So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.">2Chronicles 5:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.">2Chronicles 7:2</a>.) If even the light that remained on Moses' face after converse with God required him thenceforth ordinarily to wear a veil before the people (<a href="/context/exodus/34-33.htm" title="And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.">Exodus 34:33-35</a>), how much more needful must it be that God should cover His face when He condescends to converse with men! In the present case, it would seem to have been "the pillar of the cloud" that had guided Israel, which served Him for a covering, and out of which He spake to Moses and the people. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I came unto thee in a thick cloud</span>. Literally, "in the thickness of a cloud." God must always veil himself when he speaks with man, for man could not bear "the brightness of his presence." If he takes a human form that form is a veil; if he appears in a burning bush, the very. fire is a shroud. On the present occasion it was the more needful that he should cover himself up, as he was about to draw near to the whole congregation, among whom were many-who were impure and impenitent. It was necessary, in order that all might be convinced of the Divine mission of Moses, for all to be so near as to hear him speak out of the cloud; but sinners cannot abide the near presence of God, unless he is carefully hidden away from them. Probably, the cloud out of which he now spoke was that which had accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt, and directed their march (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>), though this is not distinctly stated. <span class="cmt_word">That the people may believe thee for ever</span>. In "the people" are included their descendants; and they are to "believe Moses <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">ever</span>, because the law is in some sense of eternal obligation on all men" (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.</span> It is not easy to assign a reason for the repetition of this clause from vers. 8, in almost identical terms. There were no fresh "words of the people" to report. We can only say that such seemingly needless repetitions are <span class="accented">in the</span> <span class="accented">manner</span> of archaic writers, who seem to intend in this way to emphasise a fact. The acceptance of the covenant by the people beforehand, completed by Moses reporting it to God, is the necessary basis of all that follows - the required preliminary to the giving of any covenant at all. <p> CHAPTER 19:10-15 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/19-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
