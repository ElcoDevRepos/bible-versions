The term "God of the Hebrews" distinguishes Yahweh from the Egyptian pantheon, asserting His unique covenant relationship with the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This encounter is reminiscent of God's earlier appearances to the patriarchs, reinforcing His ongoing involvement with His chosen people.<p><b>they answered.</b><br>Moses and Aaron are the speakers here, acting as representatives of the Israelites. Their response to Pharaoh is direct and respectful, yet firm, reflecting their role as intermediaries between God and both the Israelites and the Egyptian ruler. This dialogue sets the stage for the ensuing conflict between God's will and Pharaoh's resistance.<p><b>Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness</b><br>The request for a three-day journey is significant, symbolizing a temporary departure for worship. The wilderness represents a place of testing and divine encounter, as seen later in Israel's history. This request also serves as a test of Pharaoh's willingness to acknowledge the Israelites' right to worship their God, foreshadowing the greater exodus to come.<p><b>to sacrifice to the LORD our God,</b><br>Sacrifice is central to Israelite worship, signifying atonement, thanksgiving, and covenant renewal. The use of "LORD" (Yahweh) underscores the personal and covenantal nature of God. This act of worship is not merely ritualistic but a profound expression of obedience and devotion, contrasting with the idolatrous practices of Egypt.<p><b>or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.</b><br>This warning highlights the seriousness of the request and the potential consequences of disobedience. The mention of plagues foreshadows the actual plagues that God will unleash upon Egypt, demonstrating His power and judgment. The sword symbolizes divine retribution, a theme echoed throughout Scripture where disobedience leads to judgment.
