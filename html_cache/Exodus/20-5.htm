It prohibits the worship of idols, which was a common practice among the surrounding nations, such as the Egyptians and Canaanites. The Israelites were called to be distinct, serving only Yahweh. This commandment underscores the importance of monotheism and the rejection of polytheism. The act of bowing down signifies submission and allegiance, which should be reserved for God alone. This principle is reiterated in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes worshiping God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><b>for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God,</b><br>The term "jealous" here is not to be understood in a human sense of envy but rather as a zealousness for maintaining the covenant relationship. God's jealousy is a protective love, ensuring that His people remain faithful to Him. This reflects the covenantal nature of God's relationship with Israel, akin to a marriage, where faithfulness is paramount. The jealousy of God is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are called the bride of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>).<p><b>visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children</b><br>This phrase highlights the concept of generational consequences of sin. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the family unit was tightly knit, and the actions of one member could affect the entire household. This does not imply that children are punished for their parents' sins, but rather that the consequences of sin can have lasting effects. <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a> clarifies that each person is responsible for their own sin, yet the environment and patterns set by previous generations can influence future ones.<p><b>to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,</b><br>The mention of "third and fourth generations" indicates the enduring impact of sin, but it also implies a limit to God's judgment, contrasting with His mercy, which extends to thousands of generations (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>). The phrase "those who hate Me" refers to those who reject God and His commandments. This is a call to repentance and a warning of the seriousness of turning away from God. The generational aspect underscores the importance of teaching and living out faithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach their children about God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Ten Commandments, God's chosen people, who were delivered from Egypt and are being instructed on how to live in covenant with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The location where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, including this commandment against idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that are forbidden by God, representing false gods and leading people away from true worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/generational_consequences.htm">Generational Consequences</a></b><br>The concept that the sins of one generation can affect subsequent generations, particularly in the context of idolatry and disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_jealousy.htm">God's Jealousy</a></b><br>Understand that God's jealousy is not like human jealousy;

"I myself," says Arnobius, "not so very long ago, worshipped gods just taken out of the furnace, fresh from the anvil of the smith, ivory, paintings, stumps of trees swathed in bandages; and if I happened to cast my eyes on a polished stone smeared with olive oil, I made reverence to it, <span class= "ital">as if a power were present therein, </span>and addressed myself in supplication for blessings to the senseless block" (<span class= "ital">Advers</span>. <span class= "ital">Gentes, </span>i. 29).

Seneca says of the Romans of his own day - "They pray to these images of the gods, implore them <span class="accented">on bended knee</span>, sit or stand long days before them, throw them money, and sacrifice beasts to them, so treating them with deep respect, though they despise the man who made them" (Ap. Lact. 2:2). <span class="cmt_word">I, the Lord thy God am a jealous God</span>. God "will not give his glory to another" (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>), will not suffer a rival near his throne. He is not "jealous." as the Greeks thought (Herod. 7:10, &sect; 5), of mere success, or greatness; but he is very jealous of his own honour, and will not have the respect and reverence, which is his due, bestowed on other beings or on inanimate objects. Compare with the present passage <a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a>; etc. <span class="cmt_word">Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</span>. Exception has been taken to the plain meaning of this passage by a multitude of writers, who dread the reproach of the sceptic, that the God of the Old Testament is a God careless of justice and bent upon revenge. But neither does society, nor does civil justice itself, regard the visiting of parents' sins upon their children as in all cases unjust. Society by its scorn punishes for their parents' transgressions the illegitimate, the children of criminals, the children - especially the daughters - of adulteresses. Civil justice condemns to forfeiture of their titles and their estates, the innocent children of those executed for treason. God again manifestly does by the laws which obtain in his moral universe, entail on children many consequences of their parents' ill-doing - as the diseases which arise from profligacy or intemperance, the poverty which is the result of idleness or extravagance, the ignorance and evil habits which are the fruit of a neglected education. It is this sort of visitation which is intended here. The children and grandchildren of idolaters would start in life under disadvantages. The vicious lives of their parents would have sown in them the seeds both of physical and moral evil. They would commonly be brought up in wrong courses, have their moral sense early perverted, and so suffer for their parents' faults. It would be difficult for them to rise out of their unhappy condition. Still, "each would bear his own iniquity." Each would "be judged by that he had, not by that he bad not." An all-wise God would, in the final award, make allowance for the disadvantages of birth and inherited disposition, and would assign to each that position to which his own conduct - his struggles, efforts, endeavours after right - entitled him. To say that the threat "applies only to such children as follow the sins of their fathers" Kalisch) is to empty the passage of all force. It applies to all; but the visitation intended consists in temporal disadvantages, not in the final award of happiness or misery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/20-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You shall not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bow down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1493;&#1462;&#1445;&#1443;&#1492;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#353;&#183;ta&#7717;&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7812.htm">Strong's 7812: </a> </span><span class="str2">To depress, prostrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
