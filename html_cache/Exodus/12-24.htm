In the context of <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, the command refers to the observance of the Passover, a pivotal event in Israel's history marking their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. The Passover is a type of Christ, symbolizing Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The command to keep the Passover highlights the necessity of remembering God's acts of salvation.<p><b>as a permanent statute</b><br>The term "permanent statute" indicates that this command is not temporary but is to be observed continually. This reflects the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. The Passover is a perpetual reminder of God's deliverance and faithfulness. In the New Testament, the Lord's Supper is instituted by Jesus as a new covenant, fulfilling the Passover and establishing a lasting ordinance for believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>).<p><b>for you and your descendants</b><br>This phrase underscores the generational aspect of God's covenant. The command is not only for the immediate recipients but also for future generations, ensuring that the memory of God's deliverance is preserved. This reflects the biblical principle of teaching and passing down faith to subsequent generations (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). It also points to the continuity of God's promises and the inclusion of future believers in the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
