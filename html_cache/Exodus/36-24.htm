The forty bases suggest a foundation of redemption, aligning with the broader theme of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt. The number forty is frequently associated with periods of testing and preparation in Scripture, such as the forty years in the wilderness.<p><b>to put under the twenty frames</b><br>The frames, or boards, form the structure of the tabernacle, representing the dwelling place of God among His people. The number twenty, being a multiple of ten, can symbolize completeness or divine order. The frames provide stability and support, much like the spiritual foundation believers are called to build their lives upon.<p><b>two bases for each frame</b><br>The dual bases for each frame emphasize stability and balance. This can be seen as a reflection of the dual nature of Christ as both fully God and fully man, providing a firm foundation for faith. The pairing also suggests the importance of community and partnership in the faith journey.<p><b>one under each tenon</b><br>The tenons are the connecting points, ensuring the frames are securely joined. This detail highlights the importance of unity and connection within the body of Christ. Just as the tabernacle's structure relies on these connections, so too does the church rely on the unity of its members, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites traveled and constructed the Tabernacle as they journeyed to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle was done according to God's specific instructions, highlighting the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_involvement.htm">God's Provision and Involvement</a></b><br>The detailed planning and provision for the Tabernacle show God's involvement in the lives of His people and His desire to dwell among them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The Israelites worked together, each contributing their skills and resources, demonstrating the importance of community in accomplishing God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_tabernacle.htm">Symbolism of the Tabernacle</a></b><br>The Tabernacle serves as a symbol of God's presence and holiness, reminding us of the need for reverence and worship in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_fulfillment.htm">Christ as the Fulfillment</a></b><br>The Tabernacle points to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God among men, fulfilling the purpose of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_36_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 36:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_36_24_God_s_detailed_guidance.htm">How does Exodus 36:24 demonstrate God's attention to detail in His instructions?
