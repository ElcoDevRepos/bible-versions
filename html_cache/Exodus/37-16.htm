Gold, being a precious and incorruptible metal, symbolizes the divine nature and glory of God. In the ancient Near East, gold was often associated with royalty and deity, underscoring the sacredness of the Tabernacle as God's dwelling place among His people. The craftsmanship of these utensils reflects the skill and dedication required for worship, emphasizing that offerings to God must be of the highest quality.<p><b>its plates and dishes:</b><br>These items were used for holding the bread of the Presence, also known as the showbread, which was placed on the table in the Holy Place. The bread symbolized God's provision and His covenant with Israel. The plates and dishes being made of gold highlight the importance of the showbread as a perpetual offering before the Lord. This practice is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who provides spiritual sustenance to believers.<p><b>as well as its bowls and pitchers for pouring drink offerings:</b><br>The bowls and pitchers were used for the drink offerings, which accompanied the grain offerings and were poured out as a libation to the Lord. This act of pouring out symbolizes the offering of one's life in service to God, a theme echoed in the New Testament by the Apostle Paul, who describes his life as being poured out like a drink offering (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). The use of gold for these vessels underscores the value and significance of the offerings, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, whose blood was poured out for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the table and its articles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/table_of_showbread.htm">Table of Showbread</a></b><br>A sacred table in the Tabernacle where the showbread was placed, symbolizing God's provision and presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites traveled and where the Tabernacle was constructed and used.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_attention_to_detail.htm">God's Attention to Detail</a></b><br>The specific instructions for the table and its articles remind us of God's attention to detail and the importance of obedience in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_gold.htm">Symbolism of Gold</a></b><br>The use of pure gold signifies the value and purity required in approaching God, pointing to the holiness of worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provision_and_presence.htm">Provision and Presence</a></b><br>The table and its articles symbolize God's provision and presence, encouraging believers to trust in God's continual care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_fulfillment.htm">Christ as Fulfillment</a></b><br>The table of showbread foreshadows Christ as the true bread from heaven, inviting believers to find spiritual nourishment in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_in_spirit_and_truth.htm">Worship in Spirit and Truth</a></b><br>The meticulous preparation of the Tabernacle elements calls believers to worship God with reverence and sincerity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_37_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 37:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Exodus_37_16_skills_daily.htm">How can we apply the craftsmanship of Exodus 37:16 in our daily work?
