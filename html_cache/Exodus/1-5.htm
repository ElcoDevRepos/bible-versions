The number seventy is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or divine order. This count includes Jacob's sons and their families, as detailed in <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-27</a>. The number seventy is also mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-22.htm">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>, emphasizing the growth of the Israelites from a small family to a great nation. This growth fulfills God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants into a great nation.<p><b>including Joseph</b><br>Joseph, one of Jacob's twelve sons, plays a crucial role in the narrative of the Israelites' journey to Egypt. Sold into slavery by his brothers, Joseph rose to power in Egypt, becoming second only to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>). His presence in Egypt was part of God's providential plan to preserve Jacob's family during a severe famine (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5-7</a>). Joseph's story is a type of Christ, as he was rejected by his own, suffered unjustly, and later became a savior to his people.<p><b>who was already in Egypt</b><br>Joseph's prior arrival in Egypt set the stage for the Israelites' eventual settlement there. His position allowed him to provide for his family during the famine, as seen in <a href="/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11-12</a>. This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and foreknowledge, as He orchestrated events to ensure the survival and growth of His chosen people. Joseph's presence in Egypt also foreshadows the Israelites' future enslavement and eventual exodus, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the patriarch whose descendants form the twelve tribes of Israel.

If his female descendants were, at the time of his descent into Egypt, as numerous as the males, the entire number of those who "came out of his loins" must have been 132.
