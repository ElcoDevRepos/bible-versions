Mount Sinai is a central location in the narrative of the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It is here that God establishes His covenant with Israel, giving them the Law. The mountain is traditionally identified with Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula. The communication between God and Moses on Mount Sinai underscores the unique role of Moses as a mediator between God and His people, a role that foreshadows the mediatory work of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>).<p><b>He gave him the two tablets of the Testimony</b><br>The "two tablets of the Testimony" refer to the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed. These commandments form the core of the covenant between God and Israel, serving as a moral and legal foundation. The term "Testimony" indicates that these tablets are a witness to the covenant relationship. The giving of the tablets signifies the formalization of God's law, which is central to Israel's identity and mission. This act prefigures the New Covenant, where God's laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>tablets of stone</b><br>The use of stone tablets signifies permanence and durability, indicating that God's laws are unchanging and eternal. In the ancient Near East, important legal documents were often inscribed on stone to ensure their preservation. The stone tablets contrast with the later promise of a new covenant written on the heart, highlighting the transition from external adherence to internal transformation (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>).<p><b>inscribed by the finger of God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the commandments. The "finger of God" is a metaphorical expression indicating direct divine action. It underscores the idea that the law is not of human origin but is given by God Himself. This divine authorship is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to the "finger of God" in the context of His miracles, signifying divine power and authority (<a href="/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>). The inscribing by God's finger also points to the ultimate fulfillment of the law in Christ, who perfectly embodies and fulfills God's commandments (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the Law, who inscribed the tablets with His own finger, signifying divine authority and the sacredness of the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, who received the tablets on Mount Sinai, acting as a mediator between God and His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The holy mountain where God communicated with Moses, a place of divine revelation and covenant establishment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_tablets_of_the_testimony.htm">Two Tablets of the Testimony</a></b><br>Stone tablets inscribed by God, representing the covenant and the moral law given to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_finger_of_god.htm">The Finger of God</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating the direct action and authority of God in inscribing the tablets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_of_scripture.htm">Divine Authority of Scripture</a></b><br>The fact that the tablets were inscribed by the finger of God underscores the divine authority and inerrancy of Scripture.

The Court pre-supposed the tabernacle; the outer chamber of the tabernacle, or holy place, was a mere vestibule to the inner chamber, or holy of holies: the inner chamber was a receptacle for the ark; and the ark was a chest or coffer constructed to contain the Two Tables. The entire design having been laid down, it was a first step towards the carrying out of the design to put into the hands of Moses that treasure with a view to which all the directions concerning the tabernacle had been given.<p><span class= "bld">Two tables of testimony.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the two tables. </span>The treasure which had been glanced at in <a href="/exodus/25-21.htm" title="And you shall put the mercy seat above on the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.">Exodus 25:21</a>, and distinctly promised in <a href="/exodus/24-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.">Exodus 24:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Written with the finger of God.</span>--Comp. <a href="/exodus/24-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.">Exodus 24:12</a>, where God speaks of "commandments which <span class= "ital">He </span>has written."

It is not too much to say that the tabernacle, with its various appurtenances, was constructed for this purpose; the rest of the tabernacle was designed with a view to the holy of holies the holy of holies was designed as a receptacle for the ark - and the ark was designed as a receptacle for the tables of testimony.
