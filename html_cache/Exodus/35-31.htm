The filling of the Spirit of God indicates a special anointing for a specific task, a concept seen throughout Scripture, such as in the anointing of kings like Saul and David (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10, 16</a>:13). This divine filling is not just for spiritual leaders but also for those called to practical tasks, emphasizing that all work done for God requires His Spirit. The Spirit's involvement in craftsmanship underscores the sacredness of the work and the importance of divine guidance in all endeavors.<p><b>with skill, ability, and knowledge</b><br>These attributes are essential for the intricate work required in constructing the Tabernacle. Skill refers to the practical expertise needed to execute the work, while ability suggests the capacity to apply this skill effectively. Knowledge implies an understanding of the materials and techniques necessary for the task. This triad of qualities is reminiscent of the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where wisdom is often associated with skillful living (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The emphasis on these qualities shows that God values excellence and precision in the work done for His glory.<p><b>in all kinds of craftsmanship</b><br>The phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of Bezalel's abilities, covering a wide range of artistic and technical skills. This includes metalwork, woodwork, weaving, and more, as detailed in the subsequent verses of <a href="/exodus/35.htm">Exodus 35</a>. The Tabernacle's construction required diverse talents, reflecting the multifaceted nature of God's creation and the variety of gifts He bestows upon His people. This diversity of craftsmanship can be seen as a type of the body of Christ, where different members have different gifts but work together for a common purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-7</a>). The craftsmanship also points to the beauty and order inherent in God's design, both in the physical Tabernacle and in the spiritual temple of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The primary individual mentioned in this context, Bezalel is chosen by God to lead the construction of the Tabernacle.
