In the context of the Exodus narrative, Moses serves as the mediator between God and the Israelites. This communication underscores the covenant relationship established at Mount Sinai, where God gave the Law to His people. The phrase "the LORD" refers to Yahweh, the personal name of God revealed to Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>). This name signifies God's eternal, self-existent nature and His faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>The setting of this communication is significant. It occurs after the Israelites have been delivered from Egypt and are encamped at Mount Sinai. This location is pivotal in Israel's history as the place where they receive the Law and instructions for the Tabernacle, which will serve as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<br><br>Moses, as the leader chosen by God, is a type of Christ. Just as Moses mediates the covenant between God and Israel, Jesus mediates the New Covenant between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). Moses' role as a prophet, leader, and intercessor prefigures the ultimate work of Christ.<br><br>The phrase also introduces the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle, which will follow in the subsequent verses. The Tabernacle is a type of Christ, symbolizing God's presence with His people. It foreshadows the incarnation of Jesus, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle highlight the importance of worship and the holiness required to approach God, themes that are fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness.

The great principles of the moral law had been given in the Ten Commandments uttered by God amid the thunders of Sinai. The "Book of the Covenant," or short summary of the main laws, civil, political, and social, had been communicated to Moses, and by him reduced to a written form (<a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>). A solemn league and covenant had been entered into between God and his people, the people undertaking to keep all the words of the Lord, and God to be their Protector, Guide, and King. But no form of worship had been set up. Abstract monotheism had been inculcated; and worship had been so far touched upon that an "altar" had been mentioned, and certain directions, chiefly negative, had been given with respect to it (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24-26</a>). It remained that the abstract monotheism should be enshrined in forms, obtain a local habitation, and be set forth before the eyes, and so fixed in the heart and affections of the people. God was now about to declare to Moses what the character of the habitation should be, its size, form, and materials. But before doing this, as a first and fitting, if not necessary, preliminary, he required of the people to bring of the best of their possessions for the service which he was about to institute, enumerating the substances which he would condescend to receive at their hands, and especially enjoining upon them that all should be offered willingly and from the heart (ver. 2). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/25-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/25-1.htm">OT Law: Exodus 25:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses saying (Exo.
