The forehead is a prominent and visible part of the body, symbolizing the public and representative role of the high priest. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the forehead was often associated with identity and purpose. Aaron, as the high priest, represents the people before God, and the placement on the forehead signifies the bearing of responsibility and the need for holiness in service.<p><b>so that he may bear the iniquity of the holy things</b><br>The high priest's role includes bearing the iniquity or sin associated with the holy things. This concept underscores the imperfection of human offerings and the need for a mediator. The high priest acts as an intercessor, taking on the burden of any impurity or imperfection in the offerings. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who bears the sins of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>that the sons of Israel consecrate with regard to all their holy gifts</b><br>The sons of Israel, or the Israelites, are commanded to bring offerings and gifts to God. These gifts, though consecrated, are still tainted by human sinfulness. The high priest's role is to ensure these offerings are acceptable to God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the need for purification and sanctification in worship (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>).<p><b>It shall always be on his forehead</b><br>The permanence of the gold plate on Aaron's forehead signifies the continuous need for atonement and intercession. The high priest's role is not temporary but an ongoing requirement for the people of Israel. This continuity points to the eternal priesthood of Christ, who intercedes for believers perpetually (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p><b>so that they may be acceptable before the LORD</b><br>The ultimate goal of the high priest's actions is to make the people and their offerings acceptable to God. This acceptance is not based on the merit of the offerings themselves but on the mediation of the high priest. This anticipates the New Testament teaching that believers are made acceptable to God through the righteousness of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
