It was made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold, signifying its sacred purpose and the divine presence. The poles were used for carrying the table, as the Israelites were a nomadic people during their wilderness journey. This design ensured that the table could be transported without being touched directly, maintaining its sanctity. The use of acacia wood, a durable and resistant material, symbolizes the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>all its utensils</b><br>The utensils included dishes, pans, bowls, and pitchers, all made of pure gold. These items were used in the service of the Table of Showbread, emphasizing the importance of purity and holiness in worship. The gold signifies the value and preciousness of the offerings made to God. The detailed instructions for these utensils highlight the order and precision required in worship, reflecting God's nature as a God of order.<p><b>and the Bread of the Presence</b><br>The Bread of the Presence, also known as Showbread, consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel. It was placed on the table as a continual offering before the Lord, symbolizing God's provision and the covenant relationship between God and His people. The bread was replaced every Sabbath, and the old loaves were consumed by the priests, signifying the sustenance provided by God. This bread foreshadows Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the "Bread of Life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), indicating that He is the spiritual sustenance for believers. The presence of the bread in the Holy Place also points to the constant presence of God among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is conveying God's instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are called to contribute materials and skills for the building of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God would dwell among His people during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_table_of_showbread.htm">The Table of Showbread</a></b><br>A sacred piece of furniture in the Tabernacle, holding the Bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bread_of_the_presence.htm">The Bread of the Presence</a></b><br>Twelve loaves of bread placed on the table, representing the twelve tribes of Israel and God's continual presence and sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_provision.htm">Symbolism of Provision</a></b><br>The Bread of the Presence symbolizes God's continual provision for His people.
