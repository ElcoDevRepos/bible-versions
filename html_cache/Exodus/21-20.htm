Servants, often acquired through debt or poverty, were considered part of the household. The use of a rod indicates discipline, a common practice in ancient times for maintaining order. However, the law sets boundaries on this authority, emphasizing the value of human life. The rod symbolizes authority but also the potential for abuse, highlighting the need for justice and compassion.<p><b>and the servant dies by his hand</b><br>The phrase underscores the severity of the action leading to death, which is a critical point in the legal stipulations of the Mosaic Law. The death of a servant due to the master's actions elevates the situation from discipline to a criminal act. This reflects the biblical principle that all life is sacred, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humanity is made in God's image. The law here serves as a deterrent against excessive violence and underscores accountability.<p><b>he shall surely be punished</b><br>This phrase establishes the principle of justice and retribution. The punishment for causing a servant's death indicates that the master is not above the law, aligning with the broader biblical theme of justice found in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>. The exact nature of the punishment is not specified here, but it implies a serious consequence, possibly even death, as suggested by the principle of "life for life" in <a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23</a>.

Unlike most other codes, it proceeded to forbid the homicide of slaves. Hitherto, throughout the East, and also in many parts of the West, slaves had been regarded as so absolutely their master's property that he was entitled to do as he pleased with them. Now, for the first time--so far as we know--was the life of the slave protected. The exact extent of the protection is uncertain. According to the Talmud, the master who killed his slave was put to death; according to some modern Jews, as Kalisch, he had merely to pay a fine. In any case, the killing was an offence of which the law took cognisance. Later on it appears that even assaults on slaves, if they reached a certain intensity, were unlawful, and involved the slave's compulsory emancipation (<a href="/context/exodus/21-26.htm" title="And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.">Exodus 21:26-27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With a rod.</span>--The usual instrument of punishment. It would follow, as a matter of course, that if a more dangerous implement was used the master was punished with equal, or greater, severity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="accented">Homicide of slaves</span>. In most ancient states the slave was the absolute property of his master, and might be ill-used to any extent, even killed, without the law in any way interfering. It is said that the state of things was different in Egypt (Kalisch); but we have scarcely sufficient evidence on the point to be certain that the slave enjoyed there any real and efficient protection. At Athens, beyond a doubt, the law protected the life of the slave; and a very moderate amount of ill-treatment entitled a slave to bring an action. At Rome, on the contrary, "the master could treat the slave as he pleased, could sell him, punish him, and put him to death" (<span class="accented">Dict. of Greek & Roman Antiq</span>. p. 1036). And this was the ordinary state of the law, particularly in Oriental countries. The Mosaic legislation must be regarded as having greatly ameliorated the condition of the native slave population. Hebrew bondmen it placed nearly upon a par with hired servants (<a href="/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40</a>); foreign slaves, whether prisoners taken in war, or persons bought in the market, it protected to a very great extent. By the law given in verses 26, 27, it largely controlled the brutality of masters, who had to emancipate their slaves if they did them any serious injury. By the law laid down in verse 20, it gave their lives the same protection, or nearly the same, as the lives of freemen. "Smiting "was allowed as a discipline, without which slavery cannot exist; but such smiting as resulted in death was, as a general rule, punishable like any other homicide. The only exception was, if the slave did not die for some days (ver. 21). In that case the master was considered not to have intended the slave' s death, and to be sufficiently punished by the loss of his property. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man smite his servant, or his maid</span>. "Maids" would commonly be chastised by their mistress, or by an upper servant acting under the mistress' s authority. "A man" here means "any one." With a rod. The rods wherewith Egyptian slaves were chastised appear upon the monuments. They were long canes, like those used by our schoolmasters. Under his hand. Criminals in the East are said often to die under the bastinado; and even in our own country there have been cases of soldiers dying under the lash. A special delicacy of the nervous system will make a punishment of the kind fatal to some, which would have been easily borne by others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
