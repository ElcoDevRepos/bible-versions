The mention of horses and chariots underscores the technological and tactical superiority of Egypt at the time. Chariots were a symbol of military strength and were used effectively in warfare. The historical context here is the pursuit of the Israelites by Pharaoh's army after their departure from Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. This event is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative, demonstrating God's power over the mightiest empire of the time.<p><b>the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the miraculous intervention of God in the deliverance of the Israelites. The parting and subsequent closing of the Red Sea is a central miracle in the Old Testament, showcasing God's sovereignty over nature. This act of divine judgment against Pharaoh's army is a fulfillment of God's promise to protect His people. It also serves as a typology of salvation, where God delivers His people from bondage and destroys their enemies. This event is often referenced in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/136-15.htm">Psalm 136:15</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/9-11.htm">Nehemiah 9:11</a>, as a testament to God's enduring faithfulness and power.<p><b>But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous nature of the Israelites' escape. Walking on dry ground in the midst of the sea signifies God's provision and protection. It is a demonstration of His ability to make a way where there seems to be none. This event is a foreshadowing of the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who provides a way for believers to pass from death to life. The dry ground can also symbolize the firm foundation of faith that believers are called to walk upon. This miraculous crossing is a defining moment for the Israelites, marking their transition from slavery to freedom and serving as a powerful reminder of God's deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who pursued the Israelites after initially allowing them to leave.

When the records of Moses were collected--either by himself, towards the close of his life, or by Joshua--the addition was kept, although it had become unnecessary for the original purpose.
