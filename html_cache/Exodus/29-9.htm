In ancient Near Eastern culture, clothing often symbolized one's role and status. The sashes, or girdles, were likely made of fine linen, representing purity and holiness. This act of wrapping the sashes around Aaron and his sons was a visual representation of their consecration and dedication to God's service. The priestly garments, including the sashes, are detailed in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, emphasizing their importance in the priestly role.<p><b>and tie headbands on them</b><br>The headbands, or turbans, were another essential part of the priestly attire. They symbolized the authority and dignity of the priestly office. The headband for the high priest, Aaron, included a gold plate inscribed with "Holy to the LORD," signifying the holiness required of those who serve God. This act of tying the headbands was a public declaration of their set-apart status for divine service, aligning with the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation for God's purposes.<p><b>The priesthood shall be theirs by a permanent statute</b><br>This phrase establishes the hereditary nature of the Aaronic priesthood, indicating that it was to be passed down through Aaron's descendants. The term "permanent statute" underscores the enduring nature of this divine ordinance. This concept of a lasting priesthood is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>, which speaks of a "covenant of a lasting priesthood." The permanence of the priesthood points to the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where Christ is depicted as a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.<p><b>In this way you are to ordain Aaron and his sons</b><br>The ordination process was a sacred ceremony involving anointing, sacrifices, and the donning of priestly garments. This ordination was not merely a human appointment but a divine commissioning, as God Himself instructed Moses on how to consecrate Aaron and his sons. The ordination ritual, detailed in <a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29</a>, included the laying on of hands, symbolizing the transfer of authority and responsibility. This process foreshadows the New Testament concept of ordination, where leaders are set apart for ministry through prayer and the laying on of hands, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel.
