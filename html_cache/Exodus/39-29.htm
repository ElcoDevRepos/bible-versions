Linen, derived from flax, was a common fabric in ancient Egypt and Israel, symbolizing purity and righteousness. The use of linen in priestly garments is consistent with the biblical theme of holiness and separation for service to God.<p><b>embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn</b><br>The colors blue, purple, and scarlet were significant in ancient Israelite culture. Blue often symbolized the heavens and divine revelation, purple was associated with royalty and wealth, and scarlet represented sacrifice and atonement. The combination of these colors in the priestly garments highlighted the sacred and royal nature of the priesthood, pointing to the mediatory role between God and the people. These colors were also used in the Tabernacle, indicating a connection between the priestly service and the dwelling place of God.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's instructions. The detailed commands given to Moses for the construction of the Tabernacle and the making of the priestly garments reflect God's desire for order and precision in worship. The repeated mention of adherence to God's commands throughout Exodus underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to blessing.
