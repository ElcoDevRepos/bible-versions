The act of numbering the people was seen as an assertion of ownership or control, which is why it required divine sanction. In <a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>, David's unauthorized census led to a plague, highlighting the seriousness of this act. The census here is divinely instructed, indicating God's sovereignty over Israel.<p><b>each man must pay the LORD a ransom for his life when he is counted</b><br>The concept of a ransom reflects the theological understanding that life belongs to God. The payment served as a symbolic act of atonement, acknowledging God's ownership and the sanctity of life. This ransom was a half-shekel, a small but significant amount, ensuring that all could participate regardless of wealth. This prefigures the ultimate ransom paid by Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, where Jesus gives His life as a ransom for many.<p><b>Then no plague will come upon them when they are numbered</b><br>The payment of the ransom was a protective measure, safeguarding the Israelites from divine judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience leading to blessing and disobedience leading to curse, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The avoidance of a plague underscores the seriousness of the census and the need for atonement, pointing to the protective power of obedience to God's commands.

Moses, apparently, was contemplating such an exact enumeration when the command contained in this text was given him. It would be natural for one trained in Egyptian habits to desire such exact statistical knowledge. (For the minuteness and fulness of the Egyptian statistics of the time, see <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. ii., pp. 19-28; vol. iv. pp. 46, 47; vol. vi. pp. 35-69, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul.</span>--On being formally enrolled among the people of God, it would be brought home to every man how unworthy he was of such favour, how necessary it was that atonement should in some way or other be made for him.

The sum had been taken roughly at the time of the exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). Moses was now, it would seem, about to take it again, more accurately. No command had ever been given that the people should not be numbered; and the Egyptian habit of compiling exact statistics naturally clung to one who had had an Egyptian training.
