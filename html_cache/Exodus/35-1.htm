This assembly signifies the importance of the message he is about to deliver. In the context of the Exodus narrative, the Israelites are in the wilderness after their deliverance from Egypt, highlighting their dependence on divine guidance. The act of assembling underscores the communal nature of their covenant relationship with God, as seen in previous gatherings at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>). This gathering also prefigures the New Testament church, where believers are called to assemble for worship and instruction (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>).<p><b>and said to them,</b><br>Moses acts as the mediator between God and the people, a role that foreshadows Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). His speaking to the congregation emphasizes the importance of communication in leadership and the transmission of divine commandments. This moment is a continuation of the covenantal dialogue initiated at Sinai, where God spoke directly to Moses (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>).<p><b>&#8220;These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:</b><br>The phrase introduces a divine mandate, underscoring the authority of the commandments. The use of "the LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenantal name of God, reminding the Israelites of His eternal and unchanging nature. The commandments that follow are not mere suggestions but divine imperatives, reflecting God's holiness and the call for His people to be set apart (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This directive also connects to the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>, and anticipates the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness.

The necessity of such a re-promulgation had been indicated to him in the last injunctions received before his first descent from Sinai (<a href="/context/exodus/31-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Exodus 31:12-17</a>), and in acting as he now did, he must be viewed as carrying out those injunctions. The words here put on record are probably not the whole that he said to the people on the subject, but only some main points of his speech. He can scarcely have omitted to tell them that the Sabbath was to be henceforth "a sign" between God and His people (<a href="/exodus/31-17.htm" title="It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.">Exodus 31:17</a>).<p>(1) These are the words.--<a href="/exodus/35-2.htm" title="Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever does work therein shall be put to death.">Exodus 35:2</a> is, in the main a repetition of <a href="/exodus/31-15.htm" title="Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 31:15</a>, but <a href="/exodus/35-3.htm" title="You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the sabbath day.">Exodus 35:3</a> is new, or, at any rate, only contained by implication in any previous legislation.
