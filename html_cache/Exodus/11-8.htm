In the ancient Near Eastern context, bowing was a sign of submission and respect, often reserved for royalty or deities. The officials' act of bowing signifies their acknowledgment of the authority and power of Moses, who represents God's will. This moment foreshadows the eventual submission of Egypt to God's plan, as seen in the plagues and the Exodus.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Go, you and all the people who follow you!&#8217;</b><br>The command to "Go" reflects the culmination of God's demand for Pharaoh to release the Israelites. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from bondage, as initially stated in <a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>. The inclusion of "all the people who follow you" emphasizes the collective liberation of the Israelites, not just a select few, highlighting the comprehensive nature of God's salvation.<p><b>After that, I will depart.&#8221;</b><br>Moses' declaration of departure signifies the end of his direct confrontations with Pharaoh. This moment marks a turning point in the narrative, as the final plague&#8212;the death of the firstborn&#8212;will compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. The departure also symbolizes the impending Exodus, a pivotal event in Israel's history that prefigures the ultimate deliverance found in Christ, as referenced in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>).<p><b>And hot with anger, Moses left Pharaoh&#8217;s presence.</b><br>Moses' anger reflects righteous indignation at Pharaoh's persistent hard-heartedness and refusal to heed God's commands. This emotional response is consistent with the biblical portrayal of prophets who express God's wrath against sin and injustice. The departure from Pharaoh's presence signifies a final break, as Moses will no longer plead with Pharaoh but will instead witness God's decisive action. This moment parallels Jesus' cleansing of the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>), where righteous anger is displayed against those who oppose God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
