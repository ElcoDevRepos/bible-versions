In the context of Exodus, the Israelites were suffering under Egyptian bondage, and their cries for help had reached God. This reflects God's intimate knowledge of His people's struggles, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states that the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous. Theologically, this underscores the belief that God is not distant but actively involved in the lives of His people. The Israelites' situation in Egypt can be seen as a type of the bondage of sin, from which God delivers His people through Christ.<p><b>and took notice.</b><br>This indicates God's active response to the plight of the Israelites. The Hebrew word used here can also mean "acknowledged" or "understood," suggesting a deep, compassionate awareness. Historically, this marks the beginning of God's intervention to deliver the Israelites, leading to the calling of Moses and the subsequent Exodus. This act of taking notice is a precursor to the covenant relationship God establishes with Israel at Sinai. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God taking notice of humanity's need for salvation through Jesus Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God's love prompts Him to send His Son.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient and omnipotent Creator who is attentive to the plight of His people.
