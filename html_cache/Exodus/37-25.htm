This choice of material symbolizes the enduring nature of worship and the purity required in approaching God. The altar of incense was a crucial element in the tabernacle, representing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The use of acacia wood also connects to the construction of other tabernacle items, such as the Ark of the Covenant, emphasizing the unity and holiness of the sacred space.<p><b>It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high.</b><br>The dimensions of the altar of incense reflect precision and order, which are characteristic of God's instructions for the tabernacle. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, was a standard unit of measurement in ancient Israel. The square shape signifies balance and equality, while the height of two cubits elevates the altar, symbolizing the elevation of prayers to God. The specific measurements ensure that the altar fits perfectly within the Holy Place, maintaining the symmetry and harmony of the tabernacle's design.<p><b>Its horns were of one piece.</b><br>The horns on the altar of incense, integral to its structure, symbolize strength and power. In biblical times, horns often represented authority and protection (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50-51</a>). The fact that they were of one piece with the altar indicates the unity and completeness of the altar's purpose. The horns were also used in the ritual of atonement, where blood was applied to them (<a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>), prefiguring the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ.
