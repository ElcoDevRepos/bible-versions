Morning was a time when Pharaoh might perform daily rituals or inspections, reflecting the Egyptian practice of early morning activities. This timing also underscores the urgency and divine timing of God's message. The morning is often associated with new beginnings, symbolizing the start of God's direct confrontation with Pharaoh.<p><b>as you see him walking out to the water</b><br>Pharaoh's walk to the water likely refers to his daily visit to the Nile, which was central to Egyptian life and religion. The Nile was considered sacred, a source of life and sustenance, and Pharaoh's presence there could be linked to religious duties or personal hygiene. This setting emphasizes the confrontation between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt, as the Nile was often deified. The act of meeting Pharaoh at the Nile highlights the challenge to Egyptian deities and the assertion of God's sovereignty.<p><b>Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him</b><br>The Nile's bank serves as the stage for this divine encounter, symbolizing the boundary between God's people and Egypt. The river was a lifeline for Egypt, and this meeting place underscores the impending plagues that would strike at the heart of Egyptian prosperity. The act of waiting signifies patience and obedience to God's command, as Moses positions himself for a pivotal moment in the unfolding narrative of liberation.<p><b>and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake</b><br>The staff, previously transformed into a snake, represents God's power and authority given to Moses. This miraculous sign was first demonstrated in <a href="/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3-4</a>, serving as a testament to God's presence with Moses. The staff symbolizes divine intervention and the authority to challenge Pharaoh. It prefigures Christ's authority over creation and His power to bring about God's kingdom. The staff's transformation into a snake also foreshadows the plagues, as it embodies the confrontation between God's will and Pharaoh's resistance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, tasked by God to confront Pharaoh and demand the release of the Israelites from slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go, representing opposition to God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile_river.htm">The Nile River</a></b><br>A significant geographical and cultural landmark in Egypt, symbolizing life and sustenance for the Egyptians.
