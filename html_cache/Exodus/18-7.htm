In ancient Near Eastern culture, family relationships were highly valued, and showing respect to elders was a significant part of societal norms. Moses' action reflects humility and reverence, despite his prominent role as the leader of the Israelites. This meeting occurs after the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, indicating a time of transition and new beginnings. The act of going out to meet Jethro signifies Moses' acknowledgment of Jethro's wisdom and guidance, which is later demonstrated when Jethro advises Moses on leadership (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-24</a>).<p><b>and bowed down and kissed him</b><br>Bowing down and kissing were traditional gestures of respect and affection in ancient cultures. This act signifies Moses' deep respect and familial love for Jethro. It also reflects the customs of the time, where physical gestures were important in expressing honor and establishing relationships. The bowing can be seen as a sign of humility, which is a recurring theme in Moses' life, as seen in his interactions with God (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>). The kiss is a sign of peace and reconciliation, reminiscent of other biblical accounts such as Jacob and Esau's reunion (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>).<p><b>They greeted each other</b><br>The mutual greeting indicates a relationship of mutual respect and warmth. This encounter is not just a formal meeting but a personal and familial reunion. The greeting sets the stage for the exchange of news and advice that follows, emphasizing the importance of communication and relationship-building. In the broader biblical narrative, greetings often precede significant events or discussions, as seen in the New Testament with the greetings of the apostles in their letters (<a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>).<p><b>and went into the tent</b><br>The tent symbolizes a place of hospitality, privacy, and discussion. In the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites, the tent was a central part of daily life and a place where important conversations and decisions took place. This setting provides a backdrop for the counsel Jethro gives to Moses, which has lasting implications for the governance of the Israelite community. The tent can also be seen as a type of the tabernacle, where God would later meet with Moses and the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence and guidance (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Exodus, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

This models active hospitality and humility, much like Abraham who &#8220;went out to meet&#8221; the three visitors (<a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; As Israel&#8217;s leader, Moses&#8217; action reminds us that true greatness serves others (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also fulfills the spirit of &#8220;Honor your father and your mother&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), expanding that honor to one&#8217;s in-laws.<p>&#8226; Similar welcome scenes&#8212;Abram meeting Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17-20</a>) and the prodigal&#8217;s father running to his son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>)&#8212;underscore that going out to meet someone is a gesture of grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bowed down and kissed him.</b><p>&#8226; Bowing shows deep respect; kissing is the warm, covenantal greeting of Near-Eastern culture. Jacob &#8220;bowed to the ground seven times&#8221; before Esau and then they &#8220;embraced and kissed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/33-3.htm">Genesis 33:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses&#8217; posture mirrors the humility God requires: &#8220;Clothe yourselves with humility toward one another&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The kiss also anticipates the New Testament call to &#8220;Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>), demonstrating affectionate unity among God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They greeted each other</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew expression implies words of peace&#8212;&#8220;Shalom.&#8221; Boaz greets reapers, &#8220;The LORD be with you,&#8221; and they reply, &#8220;The LORD bless you&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>). Such mutual blessing centers conversation on God.<p>&#8226; Mutual greeting indicates equality before God: elder priest and younger prophet exchange honor, fulfilling &#8220;Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Warm verbal exchange cements relationships, guarding against suspicion or rivalry that could have arisen between Midianite priest and Israelite leader.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went into the tent.</b><p>&#8226; Moving from public welcome to private fellowship allows for testimony-sharing; verse 8 records Moses recounting &#8220;all that the LORD had done.&#8221; This echoes Peter entering Cornelius&#8217; house to explain the gospel privately (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The tent signifies a place of counsel and covenant: later, the &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; becomes the setting where Moses speaks &#8220;face to face&#8221; with God (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Inviting Jethro inside demonstrates inclusion of Gentiles who honor the true God, foreshadowing &#8220;the nations will hope in His name&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-21.htm">Matthew 12:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Hospitality culminates in shared meals (v.12), paralleling Jesus&#8217; promise, &#8220;I will come in and dine with him&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/18-7.htm">Exodus 18:7</a> portrays Moses stepping outside his own camp to honor his father-in-law with humble action, affectionate greeting, mutual blessing, and welcoming fellowship.

In the case where one is a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on the cheek" (Book i. 134).
