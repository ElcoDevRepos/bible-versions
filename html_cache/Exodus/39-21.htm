The use of blue yarn is significant, as blue often represents divinity and heavenly origin in biblical symbolism. The connection between the breastpiece and the ephod with blue yarn emphasizes the unity and divine purpose of the priestly garments. The ephod itself was a sacred vestment worn by the high priest, and its rings allowed for the secure attachment of the breastpiece, ensuring that it remained in place during priestly duties.<p><b>so that the breastpiece was above the waistband of the ephod</b><br>The positioning of the breastpiece above the waistband of the ephod highlights its prominence and importance. The breastpiece contained the Urim and Thummim, tools used for divine decision-making, signifying the high priest's role in seeking God's guidance for the people. The waistband, or girdle, of the ephod served to secure the garment, symbolizing readiness and service. The placement of the breastpiece above the waistband indicates the priority of divine guidance and judgment in the priest's service.<p><b>and would not swing out from the ephod</b><br>The secure attachment of the breastpiece to the ephod ensured stability and order during the high priest's movements. This detail underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity and function of the priestly garments, reflecting the order and precision required in worship and service to God. The stability of the breastpiece also symbolizes the steadfastness and reliability of God's guidance and judgment.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the obedience of the Israelites to God's specific instructions given to Moses. It reflects the broader theme of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands throughout the book of Exodus. The construction of the tabernacle and the priestly garments according to divine specifications highlights the importance of following God's will precisely.
