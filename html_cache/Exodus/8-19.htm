In the context of the plagues, it indicates that the magicians recognized a supernatural force beyond their own abilities. This expression is also found in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>, where Jesus refers to casting out demons by the "finger of God," highlighting divine authority. The use of "finger" suggests precision and control, emphasizing God's direct involvement in the events.<p><b>the magicians said to Pharaoh.</b><br>The magicians were Egyptian priests skilled in the arts of magic and sorcery, often serving as advisors to Pharaoh. Their acknowledgment of God's power marks a turning point, as they concede that the plagues are beyond their replication. This admission contrasts with their earlier attempts to mimic the miracles performed by Moses and Aaron, showing a shift in their understanding of the situation.<p><b>But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened,</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in Exodus, illustrating his resistance to God's will. This hardening can be seen as both a divine act and a personal choice, reflecting the tension between God's sovereignty and human free will. The hardening serves to fulfill God's purposes, demonstrating His power and ultimately leading to the liberation of the Israelites.<p><b>and he would not listen to them,</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to heed the magicians' warning underscores his stubbornness and pride. Despite the evidence of divine power, he remains obstinate, prioritizing his own authority over the counsel of his advisors. This refusal to listen is a common trait of those who oppose God's plans, as seen throughout biblical history.<p><b>just as the LORD had said.</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's word, as He had previously informed Moses that Pharaoh would not easily let the Israelites go (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3-4</a>). It underscores the reliability and foreknowledge of God, affirming that His plans will come to pass despite human resistance.

His heart remained hard. He had no need to harden it by an act of his will. Probably the visitation affected him but little, since he would possess mosquito curtains, and could inhabit the loftier parts of his palace, which would be above the height whereto the mosquito ascends (Herod, ii. 95).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God</span>. Or "of a God." It is not probable that the magicians believed in a single God, or intended in what they said to express any monotheistic idea. All that they meant to say was - "This is beyond the power of man - it is supernatural - some god must be helping the Israelites." No doubt they had come to this conclusion by a careful scrutiny of all the miracles hitherto wrought by Aaron. <span class="cmt_word">He hearkened not unto them</span>. The magicians were minded to resist no longer; but Pharaoh was otherwise minded. It is quite possible that the mosquito plague did not greatly annoy him. He would probably possess lofty apartments above the height to which the mosquito ascends (Herod. 2:95); or he may have guarded himself by mosquito curtains of the finest Egyptian muslin. His subjects would naturally suffer from such a plague far more than he. <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had said.</span> See the comment on the same phrase in ver. 11 <p> CHAPTER 8:20-24 THE FOURTH PLAGUE. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/8-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1425;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the finger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7779;&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_676.htm">Strong's 676: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something to sieze with, a finger, a toe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the magicians</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1496;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;ar&#183;&#7789;um&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
