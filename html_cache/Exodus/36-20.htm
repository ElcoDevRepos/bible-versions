The construction of the tabernacle was a significant event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The use of "he" refers to Bezalel, the chief artisan, who was filled with the Spirit of God to carry out this sacred task.<p><b>upright frames</b><br>The upright frames were essential structural components of the tabernacle, providing stability and form. These frames were likely rectangular and formed the walls of the tabernacle. The design reflects the order and precision that God required, emphasizing the importance of following divine instructions meticulously.<p><b>of acacia wood</b><br>Acacia wood was chosen for its durability and resistance to decay, making it ideal for the harsh desert environment. This wood is native to the Sinai region, where the Israelites were encamped. The use of acacia wood also symbolizes incorruptibility and purity, qualities associated with Christ, who is often typified by elements of the tabernacle.<p><b>for the tabernacle</b><br>The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and held deep theological significance, representing God's covenant and His desire to dwell with His people.
