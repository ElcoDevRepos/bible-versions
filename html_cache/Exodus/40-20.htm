These tablets represent God's covenant with Israel and are central to the nation's identity and religious life. The act of Moses taking the Testimony signifies the importance of God's law as the foundation of Israel's relationship with Him.<p><b>and placed it in the ark</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was a sacred chest made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, designed according to God's specific instructions. Placing the Testimony inside the ark symbolizes the centrality of God's law in the life of the Israelites. The ark itself is a type of Christ, as it represents God's presence among His people, just as Christ is God incarnate dwelling among humanity.<p><b>attaching the poles to the ark</b><br>The poles were used to carry the ark, ensuring that it was never touched directly by human hands, which would defile its holiness. This reflects the reverence and respect required in approaching God. The use of poles also signifies the mobility of God's presence with His people, guiding them through their journey, much like the guidance provided by the Holy Spirit in the life of believers.<p><b>and he set the mercy seat atop the ark</b><br>The mercy seat, made of pure gold, served as the lid for the ark and was the place where God's presence would appear. It was flanked by two cherubim and represented God's throne on earth. The mercy seat is a foreshadowing of Christ's atoning work, as it was here that the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, symbolizing the covering of sin. This act prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice, which provides atonement for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Law from God and was responsible for setting up the Tabernacle according to God's instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the Testimony (the tablets of the Law) and represented God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_testimony.htm">The Testimony</a></b><br>The tablets of the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poles.htm">The Poles</a></b><br>Used to carry the Ark, signifying the mobility of God's presence with His people as they journeyed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mercy_seat.htm">The Mercy Seat</a></b><br>The cover of the Ark, representing God's throne and the place of atonement where God would meet with Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_god's_word.htm">The Centrality of God's Word</a></b><br>The placement of the Testimony in the Ark underscores the importance of God's Word as the foundation of faith and life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_guidance.htm">God's Presence and Guidance</a></b><br>The Ark, with its poles, symbolizes God's continual presence and guidance, reminding believers of His faithfulness in their journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/atonement_and_mercy.htm">Atonement and Mercy</a></b><br>The mercy seat signifies God's provision for atonement, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_obedience.htm">Reverence and Obedience</a></b><br>The careful handling of the Ark reflects the reverence due to God and His commands, encouraging believers to approach God with respect and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>The Ark and the Testimony highlight the covenant relationship between God and His people, calling believers to live in faithfulness to God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_40_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 40:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Placing_tablets_in_ark_shows_obedience.htm">How does placing the tablets in the ark demonstrate obedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ark_s_role_in_God_s_covenant_Ex_40_20.htm">What significance does the ark hold in Exodus 40:20 for God's covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_40_20_Hebrews_9_4_on_ark.htm">How does Exodus 40:20 connect to Hebrews 9:4 about the ark's contents?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prioritize_God_s_word_daily.htm">In what ways can we prioritize God's word in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Moses_actions_in_Exodus_40_20_inspire.htm">How does Moses' action in Exodus 40:20 inspire us to uphold God's law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_covenant_tablets.htm">What is the significance of the tablets of the covenant in Exodus 40:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_40_20_God_s_instructions.htm">How does Exodus 40:20 reflect God's instructions to Moses?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_Ark_important_in_Exodus_40_20.htm">Why is the Ark of the Testimony important in Exodus 40:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_40.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/could_the_ark_survive_the_wilderness_intact.htm">Exodus 40:20&#8211;21 &#8211; How feasible is it that the ark and its contents remained intact through harsh wilderness conditions without any recorded damage?
