The seven lamps on the lampstand, or menorah, represent the fullness of divine light and guidance. This design was given directly by God to Moses, emphasizing its divine origin and purpose. The menorah is a central symbol in Jewish worship and is still used in synagogues today.<p><b>and set them up on the lampstand</b><br>The lampstand, or menorah, was crafted from a single piece of pure gold, signifying purity and holiness. It was placed in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle, indicating its sacred function. The lampstand's design, with its branches and almond blossoms, reflects the tree of life motif, symbolizing God's provision and presence. The menorah's light was to be maintained continually, signifying the perpetual presence of God among His people.<p><b>so that they illuminate the area in front of it</b><br>The purpose of the lamps was to provide light in the Holy Place, where the priests performed their duties.
