These festivals are Passover (Pesach), the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot), and the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot). Each of these festivals corresponds to significant agricultural and historical events. The number three often symbolizes completeness and divine perfection in the Bible, indicating the comprehensive nature of worship and dedication required from the Israelites.<p><b>you are to celebrate</b><br>The act of celebration here is not merely a suggestion but a command, emphasizing the importance of these feasts in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people. Celebration in this context involves both communal and individual acts of worship, including sacrifices, offerings, and communal meals. It underscores the joy and gratitude that should accompany worship and obedience to God.<p><b>a feast</b><br>The term "feast" in this context refers to a sacred assembly and a time of rejoicing. Feasts in the biblical sense were not only times of eating and drinking but also involved specific rituals and sacrifices. They served as reminders of God's provision and faithfulness. Each feast had its own unique significance and set of rituals, reflecting different aspects of God's relationship with His people.<p><b>to Me</b><br>This phrase indicates that the feasts are directed towards God, highlighting their purpose as acts of worship and devotion. The focus is on God as the recipient of the celebration, reinforcing the idea that these feasts are not merely cultural or social events but are deeply spiritual in nature. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God desiring a personal and covenantal relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker of the command, emphasizing His desire for His people to worship and celebrate in His presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the command, God's chosen people who are to observe these feasts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feasts.htm">Feasts</a></b><br>Specific times of celebration and worship, which include the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering, as detailed in the surrounding verses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination where these feasts are to be celebrated, symbolizing God's provision and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>The underlying context of the command, highlighting the covenant between God and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_regular_worship.htm">Importance of Regular Worship</a></b><br>The command to celebrate feasts three times a year underscores the importance of regular, intentional worship in the life of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_fellowship.htm">Community and Fellowship</a></b><br>These feasts were communal events, highlighting the importance of fellowship and unity among God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembrance_and_thanksgiving.htm">Remembrance and Thanksgiving</a></b><br>The feasts served as a time to remember God's past deliverance and provision, encouraging believers to cultivate a heart of gratitude.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_consecration.htm">Holiness and Consecration</a></b><br>The feasts required preparation and consecration, reminding believers of the need for holiness in approaching God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_fulfillment.htm">Christ as Fulfillment</a></b><br>Understanding these feasts in light of the New Testament reveals how Christ fulfills the symbolism and purpose of these celebrations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_23_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 23:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_observe_triannual_festivals_today.htm">How can we observe the "three times a year" festivals in modern life?

By fixing a tri-annual pattern, the Lord literally required His people to stop normal routines, travel to the sanctuary, and remember His works. This cadence:<p>&#8226; guarded them from spiritual drift;<p>&#8226; visually distinguished them from surrounding nations who offered impromptu, fear-driven rites;<p>&#8226; anticipated the believer&#8217;s ongoing need for regular, God-appointed worship (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a year</b><p>The phrase &#8220;a year&#8221; grounds the command in real time. It was not a vague ideal but an annual obligation anchored to Israel&#8217;s agricultural cycle&#8212;spring barley, early summer wheat, and autumn ingathering (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). Each visit corresponded with God&#8217;s material provision, reminding them that every harvest came from His hand (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to celebrate</b><p>&#8220;To celebrate&#8221; invites joy, not mere duty.

Celebration involved:<p>&#8226; corporate worship&#8212;singing, Scripture, sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>);<p>&#8226; family participation&#8212;sons, daughters, servants (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>);<p>&#8226; practical generosity&#8212;sharing portions with the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>).<p>The pattern foreshadows New-Covenant worship, where believers gather gladly around Christ&#8217;s finished sacrifice (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a feast</b><p>Old Testament &#8220;feast&#8221; means an appointed time. In context, the three primary feasts were Unleavened Bread, Weeks, and Ingathering (<a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15-16</a>). Each proclaimed God&#8217;s salvation story:<p>&#8226; Unleavened Bread marked deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Weeks celebrated the giving of the Law and the firstfruits harvest (<a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Ingathering (Tabernacles) recalled wilderness provision and pointed to final rest (<a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-36</a>).<p>The New Testament shows these feasts ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;our Passover (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>), the giver of the Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>), and the coming King who will &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; with His people forever (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Me</b><p>The directive centers every celebration on the Lord Himself: &#8220;to Me.&#8221; Worship was not human-focused entertainment or mere cultural heritage.

By traveling to the sanctuary, Israel acknowledged God&#8217;s ownership of their time, harvest, and future (<a href="/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a>). For believers today, gatherings remain &#8220;to Him&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>), with Christ personally present where two or three meet in His name (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14</a> lays down a concrete, yearly rhythm&#8212;three divinely appointed feasts&#8212;that compelled Israel to interrupt ordinary life, rejoice together, and honor the Lord as their Redeemer and Provider. Literally practiced by the nation, these celebrations also anticipate the church&#8217;s joyful, Christ-centered worship until He gathers His people to the ultimate feast in His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14-17) The first great festival--the Passover festival--had been already instituted (<a href="/context/exodus/12-3.htm" title="Speak you to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:">Exodus 12:3-20</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/13-3.htm" title="And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.">Exodus 13:3-10</a>). It pleased the Divine Legislator at this time to add to that festival two others, and to make all three equally obligatory. There is some reason to suppose that, in germ, the "feast of harvest" and the "feast of ingathering" already existed. All nations, from the earliest time to which history reaches back, had festival seasons of a religious character; and no seasons are more suitable for such festivities than the conclusion of the grain-harvest, and the final completion of the entire harvest of the year. At any rate, whatever the previous practice, these three festival-seasons were now laid down as essential parts of the Law, and continued--supplemented by two others--<span class= "ital">the </span>national festivals so long as Israel was a nation. In other countries such seasons were more common. Herodotus says that the Egyptians had six great yearly festival-times (ii. 59); and in Greece and Rome there was never a month without some notable religious festivity. Such institutions exerted a political as well as a religious influence, and helped towards national unity. This was more especially the case when, as in the present instance, they were expressly made gatherings of the whole nation to a single centre. What the great Greek panegyries, Olympic, Pythian, &c., were to Hellas, that the three great annual gatherings to the place where God had fixed His name were to Israel--a means of drawing closer the national bond, and counteracting those separatist tendencies which a nation split into tribes almost necessarily developed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-17.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of Festivals</span>. "The sanctification of days and times," says Richard Hooker, "is a token of that thankfulness and a part of that public honour which we owe to God for admirable benefits, whereof it doth not suffice that we keep a secret calendar, taking thereby our private occasions as we list ourselves to think how much God hath done for all men; but the days which are chosen out to serve as public memorials of such his mercies ought to be clothed with those outward robes of holiness whereby their difference from other days may be made sensible" (<span class="accented">Eccles. Pol</span>. 5:70, &sect; 1). All ancient religions had solemn festival seasons, when particular mercies of God were specially commemorated, and when men, meeting together in large numbers, mutually cheered and excited each other to a warmer devotion and a more hearty pouring forth of thanks than human weakness made possible at other times. In Egypt such festivals were frequent, and held a high place in the religion (Herod. 2:58-64:). Abraham's family had probably had observances of the kind in their Mesopotamian home. God's providence saw good now to give supernatural sanction to the natural piety which had been accustomed thus to express itself. Three great feasts were appointed, of which the most remarkable features were - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That they were at once agricultural and historical - connected with the regularly recurrent course of the seasons, and connected also with great events in the life of the nation; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That they could be kept only at one spot, that namely where the tabernacle was at the time located; <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That they were to be attended by the whole male population.
