The directive to not approach further signifies the holiness and reverence required in the presence of God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, approaching a deity was a serious matter, often requiring purification or specific rituals. This moment marks a pivotal point in Moses' life, transitioning from a shepherd to the leader of Israel. The command also emphasizes God's transcendence and the need for humans to recognize their limitations before the divine. Similar instances of divine encounters requiring distance can be seen in <a href="/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16-17</a> with Jacob and in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> with Isaiah's vision.<p><b>&#8220;Take off your sandals,&#8221;</b><br>Removing sandals is a sign of respect and humility, acknowledging the sanctity of the ground. In ancient cultures, removing footwear was a common practice when entering a sacred space or home. This act symbolizes the removal of defilement and the acknowledgment of God's presence. It is a gesture of submission and reverence, indicating that Moses is entering a space set apart by God. This practice is echoed in <a href="/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>, where Joshua is also instructed to remove his sandals in the presence of the commander of the Lord's army.<p><b>&#8220;for the place where you are standing is holy ground.&#8221;</b><br>The designation of the ground as "holy" signifies that it is set apart by God's presence. Holiness in the biblical context often involves separation from the ordinary for divine purposes. This encounter occurs on Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, a location that becomes central in Israel's history as the place where the Law is given. The concept of holy ground underscores the idea that God's presence sanctifies and transforms the ordinary into something sacred. This theme of holiness is prevalent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God calls His people to be holy as He is holy. The burning bush itself is a type of Christ, symbolizing God's presence in the world, unconsumed by it, much like Christ's incarnation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian.

Peter felt the same tension in <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>, crying, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&#8221;<p>- Yet the prohibition is temporary.

They would certainly not have been worn in Midian. Egyptians before the time of Moses, and Orientals generally, in ancient (as in modern) times, removed their sandals (or their shoes) from their feet on entering any place to which respect was due, as a temple, a palace, and even the private house of a great man. It is worthy of notice that God Himself orders this mark of respect to be shown to the place which His Presence has hallowed. On the reverence due to holy places, see the Note on <a href="/context/genesis/28-16.htm" title="And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.">Genesis 28:16-17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw not nigh</span>. The awful greatness of the Creator is such that his creatures, until invited to draw near, are bound to stand aloof. Moses, not yet aware that God himself spoke to him, was approaching the bush too close, to examine and see what the "great thing" was. (See ver. 3.) On the general unfitness of man to approach near to holy things, see the comment on Exodus 19:12. <span class="cmt_word">Put off thy shoes</span>. Rather, "thy <span class="accented">sandals."</span> <span class="accented">Shoes</span> were not worn commonly, even by the Egyptians, until a late period, and would certainly not be known in the land of Midian at this time. The practice of putting them off before entering a temple, a palace, or even the private apartments of a house, was, and is, universal in the East - the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of it being that the shoes or sandals have dust or dirt attaching to them. The command given to Moses at this time was repeated to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Holy</span> <span class="cmt_word">ground</span>.

The conclusion which our Blessed Lord drew from this verse (<a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>) is not directly involved in it, but depends on his minor premiss, "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." <span class="cmt_word">Moses hid his face</span>.
