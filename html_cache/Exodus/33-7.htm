The tent, not yet the Tabernacle, served as a temporary meeting place with God. The act of pitching it "at a distance outside the camp" signifies separation from the people, highlighting the holiness of God and the need for purity when approaching Him. This separation also reflects the Israelites' sin with the golden calf, which had distanced them from God's presence. The location outside the camp symbolizes the need for repentance and purification before communion with God, a theme echoed in <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>, where Jesus suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people.<p><b>He called it the Tent of Meeting,</b><br>The designation "Tent of Meeting" underscores its purpose as a place for divine-human interaction. This term is later used for the Tabernacle, which becomes the central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people. The Tent of Meeting served as a precursor to the Tabernacle, emphasizing the importance of a designated sacred space for encountering God. It foreshadows the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity in Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh dwelling among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp.</b><br>This phrase highlights the accessibility of God to those who seek Him, despite the physical separation. It implies that while the tent was outside the camp, it was not exclusive to Moses; others could approach God with their inquiries. This openness prefigures the New Covenant, where believers have direct access to God through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).

Months would necessarily elapse before the Tabernacle could be constructed according to the pattern which he had seen in the mount. During this interval he determined to make use of one of the existing tents as a "house of prayer," severing it from the others, and giving it the name "Tent of Meeting," which was afterwards appropriated to the Tabernacle. It would seem that he selected his own tent for the purpose--probably because it was the best that the camp afforded--and contented himself with another. God deigned to approve his design, and descended in the cloudy pillar on the tent each time that Moses entered it.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Moses took the tabernacle.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Moses took his tent. </span>The Hebrew article, like the Greek, has often the force of the possessive pronoun.

The decision of the matter still hung in suspense. God had not revoked his threat to withdraw himself and leave the host to the conduct of an angel. He had merely reserved his final decision (ver. 5). Moses was anxious to wrestle with him in prayer until he obtained the reversal of this sentence; but he could not be always ascending Sinai, when the camp needed his superintending care, and the camp as yet contained no place of worship, where a man could pray and be secure against disturbance. Moses, under these circumstances, with the tabernacle in his mind, but without leisure to construct it, contrived "for the present distress" a temporary tabernacle or tent. He took, apparently, the tent that had hitherto been his own, and removed it to a position outside the camp, erecting it there, and at the same time giving it the name of "the tent of meeting" (ver. 7). Hither he decreed that all persons should come who desired communion with God (ver. 7), and hither he resorted himself for the same purpose (ver. 8). It pleased God to approve these arrangements; and to show his approval by a visible token. Whenever Moses entered the "tent of meeting," the pillar of the cloud descended from the top of Sinai, and took up its station at the door of the tent (ver. 9), thus securing Moses from interruption. At the sight the people "worshipped," each at his tent's door, while Moses was privileged to speak with God "face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend" (ver. 11). Joshua accompanied him on the first occasion, and remained behind, to guard the tent, when Moses left it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses</span> <span class="cmt_word">took the tabernacle.</span> The "tabernacle" proper was not yet constructed. (See chs. 35-40.) And the word used is not that properly rendered "tabernacle" - viz., <span class="accented">mishkan</span> (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>); but the far more common word <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which means "tent." The proper translation would be, "Moses took the tent." But the question at once arises - What tent? It is suggested that the article may have the force of the possessive pronoun, and indicate that he took "his tent." (Compare <a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10</a>, where "<span class="accented">the</span> house" undoubtedly means "<span class="accented">his</span> house.") Moses took his own tent, probably as the best in the encampment, and converted it to a sacred use, transferring his own abode to another. <span class="cmt_word">Afar off from the camp</span>. The sacred and the profane must not approach each other too closely - an interval must be set between them. But the distance, evidently, was not great (ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation.</span> Rather, "the tent of meeting" or "of conference" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the tent in which he expected to meet and converse with God. See the comment on Exodus 27:21. <span class="cmt_word">Every one which sought the Lord went out.</span> Moses must have commanded this. The "tent" was not to be a mere oratory for himself, but open to all Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/33-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
