The "next day" suggests a swift move to address the sin of idolatry. Moses, as the leader and mediator, takes responsibility to confront the people. This reflects his role as a prophet and intercessor, similar to how Jesus would later act as a mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>&#8220;You have committed a great sin.</b><br>The "great sin" refers to the Israelites' idolatry, which violated the first two commandments given at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This sin is significant because it represents a breach of the covenant relationship with God. In biblical terms, idolatry is often equated with spiritual adultery, highlighting the gravity of the offense. The acknowledgment of sin is a necessary step for repentance and restoration.<p><b>Now I will go up to the LORD;</b><br>Moses' intention to "go up to the LORD" signifies his role as an intercessor. The phrase implies a physical ascent, likely to Mount Sinai, where Moses had previously encountered God. This ascent is symbolic of approaching God in prayer and supplication. It prefigures Christ's ascension and ongoing intercession for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.&#8221;</b><br>The word "perhaps" indicates uncertainty, reflecting the seriousness of the sin and the need for divine mercy. "Atonement" involves reconciliation between God and humanity, often through a sacrificial act. In the Old Testament, atonement was achieved through sacrifices, foreshadowing the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ on the cross (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>). Moses' attempt to make atonement highlights the need for a mediator, a role perfectly fulfilled by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt.

The verse calls believers today to name sin honestly, rely on God-given mediation, and rest in the once-for-all atonement secured by Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>MOSES' INTERCESSION ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE.</span><p>(30-35) When Moses had, on first hearing of God's intention to destroy the people, interceded for them (<a href="/context/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?">Exodus 32:11-13</a>), his prayers had received no direct answer--he had been left in doubt whether they were granted or no. Having now put an end to the offence, and to some extent punished it, he is bent on renewing his supplications, and obtaining a favourable reply. Once more he ascends into the mount to be quite alone, and so best able to wrestle with God in prayer; and this time he not merely intercedes, but offers himself as an atonement for the people, and is willing to be "blotted out of God's book," if on this condition they may be spared. God refuses the offer, but makes known to Moses that He relents--that He will spare the people, and allow them to continue their journey to the promised land; only He will send an angel to lead them instead of leading them Himself, and He will punish the sinners by a different punishment from that originally threatened (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm" title="Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.">Exodus 32:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-35.</span> - MOSES ONCE MORE INTERCEDES WITH GOD FOR THE PEOPLE - GOD ANSWERS HIM. No distinct reply seems to have been given to the previous intercession of Moses (vers. 11-13). He only knew that the people were not as yet consumed, and therefore that God's wrath was at any rate held in suspense. It might be that the punishment inflicted on the 3000 had appeased God's wrath: or something more might be needed. In the latter case, Moses was ready to sacrifice himself for his nation (ver. 32). Like St. Paul, he elects to be "accursed from God, for his brethren, his kinsfolk after the flesh" (<a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>). But God will not have this sacrifice. "The soul that sinneth, it shall die" (<a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>). He declares, "Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book" (<a href="/exodus/32-33.htm">Exodus 32:33</a>). Moses shall not make himself a victim. Without any such sacrifice, God will so far spare them, that they shall still go on their way towards the promised land, with Moses as their earthly, and an Angel as their heavenly leader. Only, their sin shall still be visited in God's own good time and in his own way. How, is left in obscurity; but the decree is issued - "In the day that I visit, I will visit their sin upon them" (ver. 34). And, writing long years after the event, the author observes - "And God did plague the people because they made the calf which Aaron made" (ver. 35). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span>. The day must have been well-nigh over when the slaughter of the 3000 was completed: and after that the corpses had to be buried, the signs of carnage to be effaced, and the wounded, of whom there must have been many, cared for. Moses would have had to direct, if not even to superintend, everything, and therefore could not reascend Sinai until the next day. <span class="cmt_word">Moses said unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people,</span> Not now to the elders only, as in <a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>, but to all the people, since all had sinned, and. each man is held by God individually responsible for his own sin. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have sinned a great sin</span>.
