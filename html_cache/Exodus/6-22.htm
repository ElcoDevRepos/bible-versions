This lineage is significant as it establishes the priestly heritage and responsibilities that would later be formalized in the Mosaic Law. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, highlighting the importance of Uzziel's descendants in the religious life of Israel.<p><b>were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.</b><br>Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri are noted as sons of Uzziel, indicating their role within the Levitical family. Mishael is later mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>, where he, along with Elzaphan, is tasked with carrying out the bodies of Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, after they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. This task underscores their role in maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle. Elzaphan is also referenced in <a href="/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30</a> as a leader of the Kohathite clans, further emphasizing his leadership role within the tribe. Sithri, while not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, is part of this significant lineage, contributing to the overall understanding of the Levitical family's structure and responsibilities.
