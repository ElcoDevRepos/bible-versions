The term "Passover" (Hebrew: Pesach) signifies the act of God "passing over" the Israelite homes during the final plague. The sacrifice is directed to the LORD, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The Passover lamb is a type of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, where Christ is referred to as our Passover lamb, sacrificed for us.<p><b>who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt</b><br>This highlights God's protective action during the tenth plague, where the firstborn of Egypt were struck down. The blood of the lamb on the doorposts served as a sign for God to "pass over" the homes of the Israelites, sparing them from judgment. This act of deliverance is a foreshadowing of salvation through Christ's blood, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>.<p><b>when He struck down the Egyptians and spared our homes.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The striking down of the Egyptians' firstborn was the final and most severe of the ten plagues, leading to the liberation of the Israelites. This event underscores God's sovereignty and justice, as well as His mercy towards His chosen people. The sparing of the Israelite homes is a testament to God's faithfulness to His promises, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants.<p><b>Then the people bowed down and worshiped.</b><br>The response of the Israelites is one of reverence and gratitude. Bowing down signifies submission and acknowledgment of God's authority and deliverance. Worship here is both a physical act and a spiritual response to God's mighty works.
