In ancient Israel, nighttime was associated with greater danger and uncertainty, as visibility was limited, and the potential for harm was higher. The law reflects a practical understanding of self-defense, where lethal force might be more justifiable at night. The daylight, however, provides clarity and reduces the perceived threat, suggesting that lethal force is not warranted. This distinction underscores the value placed on human life and the importance of justice being tempered with mercy.<p><b>there is guilt for his bloodshed</b><br>The phrase implies accountability for taking a life during the day, even if the person killed is a thief. This reflects the biblical principle that life is sacred, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, which emphasizes the sanctity of human life. The law requires that justice be served, and taking a life without just cause incurs guilt. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical narrative that upholds justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<p><b>A thief must make full restitution</b><br>Restitution is a key theme in biblical law, emphasizing restoration and reconciliation. The requirement for a thief to make full restitution aligns with the principle of justice found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>, where restitution is required for various wrongs. This reflects God's desire for wrongs to be righted and relationships to be restored. The concept of restitution also points to the ultimate restitution made by Christ, who paid the debt of sin on behalf of humanity.<p><b>if he has nothing, he himself shall be sold for his theft</b><br>This provision addresses the situation where a thief cannot make restitution due to lack of resources. In ancient Israel, selling oneself into servitude was a means of repaying debts, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-43</a>. This reflects the economic realities of the time and the communal responsibility to address wrongdoing. The concept of servitude for debt is also a reminder of the spiritual debt humanity owes due to sin, which is ultimately paid by Christ, who redeems believers from the bondage of sin, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thief.htm">The Thief</a></b><br>The individual who has committed theft, whose actions and consequences are being addressed in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_victim.htm">The Victim</a></b><br>The person from whom something has been stolen, who is entitled to restitution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_judge_or_authority.htm">The Judge or Authority</a></b><br>The one responsible for determining guilt and ensuring justice is served according to the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community.htm">The Community</a></b><br>The broader society that is affected by the enforcement of laws and the maintenance of justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_theft.htm">The Event of Theft</a></b><br>The act of stealing, which is the central issue being addressed in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_restitution.htm">Justice and Restitution</a></b><br>The verse underscores the importance of justice and the need for restitution when wrongs are committed.

The punishment of the housebreaker, who enters a house by day, shall be like that of other thieves - to restore <span class="accented">double</span>. <span class="cmt_word">If he have nothing</span>. Rather, "if he have not enough" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, if he cannot make the restitution required, <span class="cmt_word">then he shall be sold for his theft.</span> It is somewhat fanciful to suppose, that this punishment aimed at enforcing labour on those who preferred stealing to working for their own living (Kalisch). Probably the idea was simply the compensation of the injured party, who no doubt received the proceeds of the man's sale. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it happens after sunrise,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2224.htm">Strong's 2224: </a> </span><span class="str2">To irradiate, to rise, to appear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is guilt for his bloodshed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">A thief must make full restitution;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;al&#183;l&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he has nothing,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he himself shall be sold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nim&#183;kar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4376.htm">Strong's 4376: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sell</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for his theft.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7713;&#183;n&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1591.htm">Strong's 1591: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stealing, something stolen</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/22-3.htm">OT Law: Exodus 22:3 If the sun has risen on him (Exo.
