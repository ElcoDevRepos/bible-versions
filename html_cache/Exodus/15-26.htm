In the context of the Israelites' journey, listening to God's voice was crucial for their survival and spiritual growth. The concept of hearing God's voice is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the relationship between God and His people. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Shema begins with "Hear, O Israel," underscoring the importance of listening as a form of worship and obedience.<p><b>and do what is right in His eyes,</b><br>This phrase calls for moral and ethical behavior aligned with God's standards. The Israelites were to live according to God's righteousness, not their own understanding. This is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trusting in the Lord rather than leaning on one's own understanding. The idea of doing what is right in God's eyes is a central theme throughout the Bible, as seen in the lives of figures like Noah and David, who found favor with God through their righteous actions.<p><b>and pay attention to His commands,</b><br>Paying attention to God's commands involves a deliberate focus on His laws and decrees. The Israelites received the Law at Mount Sinai, which provided a comprehensive guide for living in a way that pleases God. This phrase underscores the necessity of not just hearing but actively engaging with God's instructions. <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a> is a profound meditation on the beauty and necessity of God's law, illustrating the blessings of obedience.<p><b>and keep all His statutes,</b><br>Keeping God's statutes implies a commitment to uphold His laws consistently. The statutes given to Israel were meant to set them apart as a holy nation. This concept is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are called to live holy lives (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The idea of keeping God's statutes is also a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience is a response to His faithfulness.<p><b>then I will not bring on you any of the diseases I inflicted on the Egyptians.</b><br>This phrase serves as a conditional promise of protection and health. The plagues of Egypt were a demonstration of God's power and judgment against disobedience and idolatry. By contrast, obedience to God would result in His protection from such afflictions. This promise reflects the broader biblical principle that obedience leads to blessing, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's faithfulness.<p><b>For I am the LORD who heals you.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration reveals God's character as a healer, both physically and spiritually. The name Jehovah-Rapha, meaning "The Lord who heals," is introduced here, signifying God's ability to restore and make whole. This aspect of God's nature is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who healed the sick and offered spiritual healing through His sacrifice (<a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16-17</a>). The promise of healing is a testament to God's compassion and desire for the well-being of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals Himself as the healer and protector of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who conveys God's message to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, recently delivered from slavery in Egypt, now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, known for the plagues that God sent as judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marah.htm">Marah</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites encountered bitter water, leading to God's promise of healing and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_blessing.htm">Obedience and Blessing</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is directly linked to receiving His blessings and protection.
