In the context of the Israelites, a willing heart signifies a readiness to serve God out of love and devotion rather than obligation. This mirrors the New Testament teaching in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul states that God loves a cheerful giver. The willingness of the heart is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the importance of intention and sincerity in worship and service.<p><b>both men and women</b><br>The inclusion of both genders underscores the communal effort and unity among the Israelites. In a patriarchal society, the mention of women alongside men in this context is significant, indicating that the call to contribute to the Tabernacle was inclusive and valued the contributions of all members of the community. This reflects the egalitarian aspect of spiritual service, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul speaks of equality in Christ.<p><b>came and brought brooches and earrings, rings and necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry</b><br>The specific mention of jewelry items highlights the personal sacrifice involved in the offering. These items were likely part of the personal adornment and wealth of the individuals, possibly acquired during their time in Egypt. The act of giving these items signifies a relinquishing of personal treasures for the sake of God's dwelling place. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament call to lay up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>And they all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD</b><br>The wave offering was a type of sacrifice where the offering was waved before the Lord, symbolizing its presentation to Him. This act of worship signifies acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision. The gold, a valuable and precious metal, represents the best of what the people had to offer. This foreshadows the ultimate offering of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself as a perfect sacrifice, fulfilling the law and the prophets. The wave offering also connects to the idea of consecration and dedication, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living

Mean</div><b>So all who had willing hearts</b><p>The movement begins in the inner person. &#8220;So all who had willing hearts&#8221; signals that God values voluntary devotion, never coerced compliance (<a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>). From the New Testament we learn that &#8220;God loves a cheerful giver&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>), echoing this very scene. The people&#8217;s hearts were stirred by gratitude for deliverance from Egypt and by the tangible presence of the LORD in their midst; their willingness demonstrates faith working through love (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-9.htm">1 Chronicles 29:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both men and women</b><p>Scripture highlights that generosity is not confined to one gender or social class. In the wilderness community everyone mattered, just as in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> the gospel declares that all are &#8220;one in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The Book of Judges records Deborah leading Israel (<a href="/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2</a>), while Luke notes that women supported Jesus&#8217; ministry out of their own means (<a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a>). Here, too, both sexes stand shoulder-to-shoulder in worshipful giving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came and brought</b><p>Willing hearts translated into concrete action. Faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>), so the people physically approached Moses&#8217; collection point with their gifts. Their movement mirrors the widow who &#8220;came and put in two small coins&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>), proving that genuine devotion moves the feet as well as the feelings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Brooches and earrings, rings and necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry</b><p>They handed over personal ornaments&#8212;items of beauty, sentiment, and security. What Egypt once lavished on them (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>) is now surrendered to the God who freed them. Jesus later taught, &#8220;Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>). By parting with adornments often associated with personal status (<a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9</a>), they made a costly statement: God&#8217;s presence is worth more than personal display. The early church echoed this spirit when believers laid proceeds at the apostles&#8217; feet (<a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They all presented their gold</b><p>The phrase underscores unity. No faction withheld; the entire congregation stepped forward. Nehemiah would later celebrate a similar moment when &#8220;God had given them great joy; the women and children also rejoiced&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/12-43.htm">Nehemiah 12:43</a>). <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a> foretells willing volunteers in the day of God&#8217;s power; <a href="/bsb/exodus/35.htm">Exodus 35</a> shows the template.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a wave offering to the LORD</b><p>A wave offering was lifted before God, signifying that the gift belonged to Him first (<a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>). By waving the gold, the Israelites acknowledged the LORD as the true owner and dedicated the material for sacred use in the tabernacle. <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a> urges believers to offer &#8220;a sacrifice of praise,&#8221; while <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> calls us to present our bodies as living sacrifices. The wave offering bridges tangible gold with the greater call to offer ourselves wholly to the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a> portrays a community transformed by grace, expressing wholehearted devotion through voluntary, sacrificial giving. Both men and women, moved by willing hearts, convert personal treasure into worship, publicly acknowledging God&#8217;s ownership. Their unified wave offering models the timeless principle that genuine faith joyfully surrenders valuable resources to advance God&#8217;s dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Both men and women . . . brought bracelets . . . --</span>It is not quite certain what the personal ornaments here mentioned are.
