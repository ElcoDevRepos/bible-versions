In the ancient Near Eastern context, livestock such as oxen and donkeys were valuable assets, essential for agriculture and transportation. The loss of such animals could significantly impact a person's livelihood. The directive to assist even an enemy reflects a broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, which is echoed in the New Testament teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, where believers are instructed to love their enemies.<p><b>you must return it to him.</b><br>The command to return the stray animal underscores the importance of restitution and reconciliation. This act of returning the animal is not merely about property rights but about restoring relationships and promoting peace. It aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>, which encourage acts of kindness towards one's enemies. This principle also prefigures the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized reconciliation and forgiveness, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), where love and mercy transcend enmity and cultural boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai, including this commandment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws were given, forming the covenant community under God&#8217;s guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>- The place where God delivered the Law to Moses, including the instructions found in <a href="/bsb/exodus/23.htm">Exodus 23</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/ox_and_donkey.htm">Ox and Donkey</a></b><br>- Common animals in ancient agrarian societies, representing valuable property and livelihood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemy.htm">Enemy</a></b><br>- A person with whom one has conflict or animosity, highlighting the challenge of the commandment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_law.htm">Obedience to God's Law</a></b><br>The command to return a stray animal, even to an enemy, underscores the importance of obeying God's law over personal feelings of animosity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promoting_reconciliation.htm">Promoting Reconciliation</a></b><br>By returning an enemy's lost property, we take a step towards reconciliation and peace, reflecting God's desire for harmony among His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/demonstrating_integrity.htm">Demonstrating Integrity</a></b><br>This commandment calls believers to act with integrity and fairness, even when dealing with those who oppose us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_character.htm">Reflecting God's Character</a></b><br>God&#8217;s laws often reflect His character.

The legislator extends this duty to cases where the owner is our personal enemy. It was not generally recognised in antiquity that men's enemies had any claims upon them. Cicero, indeed, says--"Sunt autem quaedam officia etiam adversus eos servanda, a quibus injuriam aceeperis" (<span class= "ital">De Off. i.</span> 11); but he stops short of enjoining active benevolence. Here and in <a href="/exodus/23-5.htm" title="If you see the ass of him that hates you lying under his burden, and would forbear to help him, you shall surely help with him.">Exodus 23:5</a> we have a sort of anticipation of Christianity--active kindness to an enemy being required, even when it costs us some trouble.

A private enemy is here spoken of, not a public one, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>. It is remarkable that the law should have so far anticipated Christianity as to have laid it down that men have duties of friendliness even towards their enemies, and are bound under certain circumstances to render them a service. "Hate thine enemies" (<a href="/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>) was no injunction of the Mosaic taw, but a conclusion which Rabbinical teachers unwarrantably drew from it. Christianity, however, goes far beyond Mosaism in laying down the broad precept - "Love your enemies." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/23-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you encounter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1438;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;ip&#772;&#183;ga&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6293.htm">Strong's 6293: </a> </span><span class="str2">To impinge, by accident, violence, by importunity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your enemy&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1469;&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1435;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_341.htm">Strong's 341: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hating, an adversary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stray</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#8216;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8582.htm">Strong's 8582: </a> </span><span class="str2">To vacillate, reel, stray</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ox</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7794.htm">Strong's 7794: </a> </span><span class="str2">A head of cattle (bullock, ox, etcetera)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">donkey,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2543.htm">Strong's 2543: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male ass</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you must return</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it to him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1462;&#1430;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#7687;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/23-4.htm">OT Law: Exodus 23:4 If you meet your enemy's ox (Exo.
