This phrase indicates a continuation of Pharaoh's resistance to God's commands. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart can be understood as both a divine act and a result of Pharaoh's own stubbornness. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, Pharaoh was considered a god-king, and his refusal to submit to the God of Israel highlights the spiritual battle between the God of the Hebrews and the gods of Egypt. This hardening is also a fulfillment of God's earlier pronouncement to Moses in <a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>, where God foretold that He would harden Pharaoh's heart.<p><b>and he would not listen to them</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to listen to Moses and Aaron is significant in the narrative, as it sets the stage for the subsequent plagues. This refusal is not merely a personal choice but a demonstration of the spiritual blindness and pride that often accompany a hardened heart. In the broader biblical context, this can be seen as a warning against ignoring God's word and messengers. The New Testament echoes this theme in passages like <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>, which warns against hardening one's heart when hearing God's voice.<p><b>just as the LORD had said</b><br>This phrase underscores the sovereignty and foreknowledge of God. It reassures the reader that the events unfolding are not outside of God's control but are happening according to His divine plan. This fulfillment of God's word is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing that God's promises and warnings are trustworthy. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, as seen in His deliverance of Israel from Egypt. This theme of divine foreknowledge and fulfillment is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the life and mission of Jesus Christ, who fulfills Old Testament prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against the Israelites, refusing to let them go as God commanded.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God's chosen leaders to confront Pharaoh and demand the release of the Israelites from slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who sent Moses and Aaron to deliver His people and demonstrate His power over Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, and where God performed signs and wonders to compel Pharaoh to release His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardening_of_pharaoh's_heart.htm">The Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart</a></b><br>A significant event where Pharaoh's resistance to God's command is emphasized, showcasing God's sovereignty and Pharaoh's stubbornness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's control over events, including the hardening of hearts, serves His greater purpose and plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_a_hardened_heart.htm">The Danger of a Hardened Heart</a></b><br>A hardened heart resists God's will and leads to spiritual blindness and eventual judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>Moses and Aaron's obedience in confronting Pharaoh demonstrates faithfulness despite opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_signs_and_wonders.htm">The Role of Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous signs serve to reveal God's power and authority, calling people to repentance and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to listen highlights the importance of heeding God's word to avoid spiritual peril.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_7_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 7:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Pharaoh_s_defiance_Our_obedience_test.htm">How does Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus 7:13 challenge our obedience to God?
