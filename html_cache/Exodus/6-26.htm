Aaron, the older brother, serves as Moses' spokesperson due to Moses' claimed lack of eloquence (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10-16</a>). This partnership highlights the importance of teamwork in fulfilling God's mission. Moses, raised in Pharaoh's household, is uniquely positioned to confront Egyptian authority. Their leadership is a type of Christ, as both serve as deliverers of God's people, prefiguring Jesus' role as the ultimate deliverer from sin.<p><b>to whom the LORD said</b><br>The direct communication from the LORD underscores the divine authority and mandate behind their mission. This phrase emphasizes the personal relationship and covenantal faithfulness of God to His chosen leaders. It reflects the pattern of God speaking to His prophets and leaders throughout the Old Testament, such as with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and later with the prophets.<p><b>&#8220;Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This command is the central theme of the Exodus narrative, representing God's deliverance of His people from bondage. Egypt, a symbol of oppression and idolatry, contrasts with the Promised Land, a symbol of freedom and divine blessing. The deliverance from Egypt is a foundational event in Israel's history, often referenced throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a>). It prefigures the spiritual deliverance through Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>by their divisions.&#8221;</b><br>The term "divisions" suggests an organized, structured departure, possibly indicating military-like formations. This organization reflects God's orderliness and the preparation for the journey to the Promised Land. It also foreshadows the establishment of Israel as a nation with tribal divisions, as seen in the later census and organization in the Book of Numbers. This structured departure contrasts with the chaos of their enslavement, symbolizing a new beginning under God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Exodus account, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
