Throughout the Bible, God's anger is often a response to disobedience or lack of faith, as seen in <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8</a>. God's anger is righteous and just, contrasting with human anger, which can be sinful. This moment highlights the seriousness of Moses' calling and the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>and He said, &#8220;Is not Aaron the Levite your brother?</b><br>God introduces Aaron, Moses' biological brother, emphasizing familial ties. Aaron's designation as a Levite is significant, as the Levites were later set apart for priestly duties (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). This foreshadows Aaron's future role as the first high priest of Israel. The mention of Aaron also underscores God's provision and preparation, as He had already planned for Aaron to assist Moses.<p><b>I know that he can speak well</b><br>God acknowledges Aaron's eloquence, addressing Moses' concern about his own speaking abilities (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). This demonstrates God's omniscience and His ability to equip His servants with the necessary resources. Aaron's speaking skills complement Moses' leadership, illustrating how God uses different gifts within the body of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).<p><b>and he is now on his way to meet you</b><br>This phrase shows God's sovereignty and foreknowledge, as He orchestrates events to fulfill His purposes. Aaron's journey to meet Moses is a divine appointment, reflecting how God prepares the way for His plans to unfold. This meeting is pivotal for the liberation of the Israelites, as it marks the beginning of their joint mission.<p><b>When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart</b><br>Aaron's joy upon seeing Moses signifies the unity and support between the two brothers. This joy is a testament to God's ability to bring encouragement and confirmation through others. It also highlights the importance of fellowship and partnership in ministry, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>.

The expression used is a strong one, but does not perhaps here mean more than that God was displeased. At least, he did not punish the offender in any severer way than by the withholding of a gift that he was ready to bestow, and the partition between two of a position and a dignity which Moses might have had all to himself. Perhaps diffidence and self-distrust, even when out of place, are not altogether abhorrent to One whose creatures are continually offending him by presumption and arrogance. <span class="cmt_word">Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know,</span> etc. This translation is wrong. The two clauses form one sentence, and should be rendered, "Do I not know that Aaron the Levite, thy brother, speaks well?" Aaron's designation as "the Levite" is remarkable, and seems to glance at the future consecration of his tribe to God's especial service. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, he cometh forth to meet thee</span>. It has been conjectured that Aaron designed to visit Moses in Midian, in order to convey to him the intelligence that the king who had sought his life (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>) was dead. He did not, however, start on the journey till God gave him a special direction (ver. 27). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_639.htm">Strong's 639: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nose, nostril, the face, a person, ire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7717;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
