In the context of the Old Testament, seeing God was often associated with death due to His holiness and the sinfulness of man (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The "nobles of Israel" refers to the leaders who accompanied Moses up the mountain. God's decision not to "lay His hand" on them signifies His grace and the establishment of a covenant relationship. This moment foreshadows the New Covenant through Christ, where believers are invited into God's presence without fear of death (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>they saw Him,</b><br>The experience of seeing God is rare and significant in the biblical narrative. While the text does not specify the form in which God appeared, it suggests a theophany, a visible manifestation of God. This encounter emphasizes the unique relationship between God and Israel, setting the stage for the covenant. It parallels other biblical instances where God reveals Himself, such as to Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>), highlighting His glory and holiness.<p><b>and they ate and drank.</b><br>Eating and drinking in the presence of God symbolizes fellowship and covenant ratification. In ancient Near Eastern culture, meals often accompanied the sealing of agreements. This act signifies peace and communion with God, reminiscent of the future Messianic banquet (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). It prefigures the Lord's Supper, where believers partake in communion, celebrating the New Covenant through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>).

By every prior warning this nearness should have been lethal: &#8220;You are not able to come up... lest He break out against them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12&#8211;24</a>).<p>- Yet &#8220;God did not lay His hand&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>). His restraint highlights mercy in the midst of holiness. Isaiah feared death when he saw the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and later God tells Moses, &#8220;You cannot see My face, for no one may see Me and live&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). Here, however, the Lord suspends judgment to welcome covenant representatives.<p>- The moment foreshadows the protection believers now enjoy in Christ, &#8220;for God did not appoint us to wrath but to obtain salvation&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>); His hand of judgment fell instead on His Son (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They saw Him</b><p>- Verse 10 describes &#8220;under His feet something like a pavement of sapphire.&#8221; The elders &#8220;saw&#8221; a manifestation of God&#8217;s glory, not the unveiled essence (cf. <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>- Scripture holds together two truths: no one can fully see God and live (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>), yet God graciously makes Himself visible in limited, approachable ways&#8212;burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2&#8211;6</a>), pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), and ultimately in &#8220;the image of the invisible God,&#8221; Jesus Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p>- Such visions are never casual sightseeing; they are covenant-affirming encounters meant to deepen reverence and obedience, as when Jacob declared, &#8220;I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they ate and drank</b><p>- Sharing a meal sealed the covenant just ratified by blood (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6&#8211;8</a>). In ancient practice, table fellowship signified peace, acceptance, and binding agreement (<a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>).<p>- Eating &#8220;before the Lord&#8221; points ahead to other sacred meals: the peace offering (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>), the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>), and the Lord&#8217;s Supper where Jesus said, &#8220;Do this in remembrance of Me&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>- The scene also previews the ultimate banquet: &#8220;Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). God desires not distant subjects but covenant partners who enjoy His presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a> reveals a breathtaking balance: the holy God allows sinful people into His presence, withholds judgment, reveals Himself, and shares a meal. The verse magnifies His mercy, underscores the reality of divine self-revelation, and celebrates covenant fellowship&#8212;all of which find their fullest expression in Jesus Christ, our Mediator and future host at the marriage supper of the Lamb.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The nobles.</span>--The word used is an unusual one, but seems to designate the "elders" of <a href="/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-9.htm" title="Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:">Exodus 24:9</a>.

Yet some times he chose to show himself, in vision or otherwise, to his people, and then, as there could be no guilt on their part, there was no punishment on his.
