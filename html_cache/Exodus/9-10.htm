Furnaces in ancient Egypt were often used for brick-making, a task the Israelites were forced into during their enslavement (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>). This soot, therefore, represents the oppression and suffering of the Israelites. Standing before Pharaoh signifies a direct confrontation with the power of Egypt, highlighting the boldness and authority given to Moses and Aaron by God. This act is a continuation of the plagues, which serve as judgments against the gods of Egypt, demonstrating the LORD's supremacy (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>).<p><b>Moses tossed it into the air,</b><br>The action of tossing soot into the air is a prophetic gesture, symbolizing the spread of the plague throughout Egypt. This act can be seen as a type of divine judgment, reminiscent of how God uses seemingly small actions to bring about significant consequences. The gesture also reflects the power of God working through Moses, as the simple act of tossing soot results in a widespread affliction. This mirrors other biblical instances where God uses physical actions to convey spiritual truths, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<p><b>and festering boils broke out on man and beast.</b><br>The plague of boils is the sixth plague and marks a turning point in the severity of the plagues. Boils, or skin diseases, were considered a severe affliction in ancient cultures, often associated with impurity and divine disfavor. This plague directly affects both humans and animals, indicating the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. The affliction of boils is reminiscent of the suffering of Job (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>), highlighting themes of testing and divine sovereignty. The inclusion of both man and beast underscores the totality of God's power over all creation, as well as the interconnectedness of human and animal life in the Egyptian economy and religion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The very symbol of Israel&#8217;s oppression now becomes a tool of judgment&#8212;God turns Egypt&#8217;s pride back on itself, as He later will with the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pictures Egypt as &#8220;an iron furnace&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-51.htm">1 Kings 8:51</a>), so this action underlines the Lord&#8217;s power over every supposed stronghold of the oppressor.<p>&#8226; The definite article&#8212;&#8220;the furnace&#8221;&#8212;suggests a specific, frequently used kiln in Memphis or Pi-Rameses. By taking soot from it, Moses and Aaron act in full view of Egyptian artisans and priests, exposing the futility of their gods (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stood before Pharaoh</b><p>&#8226; God had repeatedly instructed Moses, &#8220;Go in to Pharaoh&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>; 8:1), demonstrating that earthly authority must answer to heavenly authority (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing &#8220;before&#8221; Pharaoh is courtroom language: the sovereign of Egypt now faces the Sovereign of the universe (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; This public confrontation removes any possibility that the plague is coincidence; Pharaoh sees the cause and the effect side-by-side (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses tossed it into the air</b><p>&#8226; The gesture is deliberate and visible, echoing the earlier plague where Aaron stretched his staff and &#8220;dust&#8230;became gnats&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-17.htm">Exodus 8:17</a>). What once filled the air as harmless dust now becomes a deadly pollutant, underlining God&#8217;s control over the elements (<a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Egyptian magicians sometimes scattered incense or ashes to invoke healing deities. By flipping that ritual, the Lord shows the impotence of Egypt&#8217;s gods&#8212;especially Imhotep, patron of healing (<a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The upward toss also pictures judgment descending from above, just as &#8220;fire and hail&#8221; will fall in the next plague (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>; <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and festering boils broke out on man and beast</b><p>&#8226; The boils (&#8220;festering,&#8221; <a href="/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>) mirror the judgment threatened in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a> for covenant disobedience, emphasizing that sin always invites divine discipline.<p>&#8226; Both &#8220;man and beast&#8221; suffer, expanding the reach beyond earlier plagues (cf. <a href="/exodus/8-2.htm">Exodus 8:2</a>; 9:4). The whole created order groans when rulers harden their hearts (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the magicians &#8220;could not stand before Moses because of the boils&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/9-11.htm">Exodus 9:11</a>), a reversal of their earlier posturing (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>). Their physical collapse pictures spiritual defeat (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; In Revelation the first bowl judgment brings &#8220;harmful and painful sores&#8221; on idol-worshipers (<a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>), showing that Exodus is both history and template: God will again confront hardened hearts on a worldwide scale.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a> records more than an uncomfortable skin disease; it displays the Lord&#8217;s mastery over Egypt&#8217;s power structures, religious rituals, and even their bodies. By turning furnace soot into a plague of boils, God transforms a symbol of Israel&#8217;s bondage into an instrument of Egypt&#8217;s humiliation. Pharaoh watches helplessly as the so-called healing arts of his magicians crumble and his people writhe in pain. The passage warns every generation that pride invites judgment, while also assuring God&#8217;s people that He can repurpose the very tools of oppression for their deliverance and His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven.</span>--Presenting it, as it were, to God, in evidence of His people's wrongs.<p><span class= "bld">A boil breaking forth with blains.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">an inflammation, producing pustules.</span> Diseases of this character are not uncommon in Egypt (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>), but they are not often very severe; nor do they attack indifferently man and beast.
