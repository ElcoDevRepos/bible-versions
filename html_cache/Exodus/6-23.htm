His marriage to Elisheba signifies the establishment of a priestly lineage. Elisheba, whose name means "God is my oath," is a woman of notable lineage, connecting Aaron to the tribe of Judah through marriage. This union symbolizes the unity and cooperation between the tribes of Levi and Judah, which are significant in Israel's history.<p><b>the daughter of Amminadab</b><br>Amminadab is a member of the tribe of Judah, and his name means "my kinsman is noble." This connection to Judah is significant, as Judah is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would descend. The mention of Amminadab highlights the importance of family lineage and heritage in biblical narratives, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through specific family lines.<p><b>and sister of Nahshon</b><br>Nahshon is a prominent figure in the tribe of Judah and is recognized as a leader during the wilderness journey. He is listed in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, underscoring the messianic significance of this family line. Nahshon's leadership role and his connection to Aaron through Elisheba further illustrate the interconnectedness of Israel's tribes and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar</b><br>These four sons of Aaron are significant in the establishment of the priesthood. Nadab and Abihu, the eldest, are known for their tragic deaths due to offering unauthorized fire before the Lord, as recorded in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10</a>. This event underscores the holiness required in serving God and the serious nature of the priestly office. Eleazar and Ithamar continued the priestly line, with Eleazar succeeding Aaron as high priest. The priesthood established through Aaron's sons is a type of the ultimate high priesthood of Jesus Christ, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

This union is not a side-note; Scripture carefully records marriages that shape redemptive history. Notice how God weaves together:<p>&#8226; The tribe of Levi (Aaron) with the tribe of Judah (Elisheba), showing priesthood and kingship converging long before Christ unites them perfectly (<a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; A stable, covenantal family life for the man who will intercede for the nation (compare <a href="/1_timothy/3-5.htm">1 Timothy 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The fulfillment of God&#8217;s earlier promise that the people would become &#8220;a kingdom of priests&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), beginning in Aaron&#8217;s household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the daughter of Amminadab</b><p>Elisheba&#8217;s father, Amminadab, is a prominent Judahite ancestor listed in the Messianic line (<a href="/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>). By highlighting him, the verse:<p>&#8226; Roots Aaron&#8217;s marriage in a respected, God-fearing lineage (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22</a>&#8208;23).<p>&#8226; Anticipates how priestly and royal streams will flow together in Christ, our High Priest and King (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to record every link in the chain of promise, strengthening our confidence in the reliability of the genealogies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sister of Nahshon</b><p>Nahshon is &#8220;the leader of the people of Judah&#8221; during the wilderness march (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; 2:3).

Their story teaches:<p>&#8226; Privilege does not guarantee obedience; every generation must personally honor God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Even at the priesthood&#8217;s launch, holiness remains non-negotiable (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice is as real as His mercy, validating the seriousness of the sacrificial system that points to Christ&#8217;s perfect sacrifice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eleazar and Ithamar</b><p>These two younger sons step into service after their brothers&#8217; death (<a href="/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>).
