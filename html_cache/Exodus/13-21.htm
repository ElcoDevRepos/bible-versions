It reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He actively guides and protects them. This divine guidance is a fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, showing His faithfulness. The presence of the LORD going before them also prefigures the role of Christ as the Good Shepherd who leads His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>in a pillar of cloud</b><br>The pillar of cloud served as a visible manifestation of God's presence, providing assurance and direction. In the ancient Near Eastern context, clouds were often associated with divine presence and majesty. This cloud not only guided the Israelites but also provided shade and protection from the harsh desert sun. The cloud is reminiscent of the Shekinah glory that later filled the Tabernacle and Temple, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people.<p><b>to guide their way by day</b><br>This guidance by day ensured that the Israelites could travel safely and efficiently through the wilderness. The phrase highlights God's provision and care, ensuring that His people did not wander aimlessly. It also underscores the importance of divine guidance in the believer's life, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trusting in the Lord leads to a straight path.<p><b>and in a pillar of fire</b><br>The pillar of fire provided light and warmth during the cold desert nights, symbolizing God's protection and presence. Fire is often associated with God's holiness and power, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the consuming fire on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). This fire prefigures the Holy Spirit, who illuminates and guides believers (<a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>).<p><b>to give them light by night</b><br>The light by night ensured that the Israelites could continue their journey without fear of darkness or danger. This divine illumination is a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and guidance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path. It also foreshadows Christ as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>so that they could travel by day or night</b><br>This phrase indicates the continuous and unceasing nature of God's guidance and provision. The ability to travel by day or night reflects God's sovereignty and control over all circumstances, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled. It also symbolizes the believer's journey through life, where God's presence enables them to navigate both the bright and dark times with confidence and trust.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who actively guides and protects His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recently delivered from slavery in Egypt, now journeying towards the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pillar_of_cloud_and_fire.htm">Pillar of Cloud and Fire</a></b><br>Manifestations of God's presence, providing guidance and protection for the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of travel through the desert, where the Israelites rely on God's guidance and provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, representing bondage and oppression.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_guidance.htm">God's Presence and Guidance</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the lives of His people, providing guidance and direction.

The Israelites marched, it is implied, some part of each day and some part of each night, which would be in accordance with modern practice, and is an arrangement introduced to get the march accomplished before the sun attains his full power. The pillar was at once a signal and a guide. When it moved, the people moved; when it stopped, they encamped (<a href="/context/exodus/40-36.htm" title="And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:">Exodus 40:36-38</a>); where it went, they followed. It bore some resemblance to the fire and smoke signals which generals used when at the head of their armies (Lepsius, <span class= "ital">Denkmaler,</span> vol. ii., pl. 150, 2; <span class= "ital">Papyr. Anastas,</span> 1; Q. Curt, <span class= "ital">Vit.

Having stated, in verse 17, that "God led the Israelites," and determined their route for them, the writer here proceeds to explain how this leading was accomplished. With extreme simplicity and directness he states, that the conduct was effected by means of an appearance, which in the daytime was like a column or pillar of smoke ascending from earth to heaven, and in the night was like a pillar of fire. He considers the presence of God to have been in the pillar, which moved in front of the host, and showed them the way that they were to go. When it halted, they halted when it advanced, they advanced. Their journeys being made as much in the night-time as in the day, on account of the intense heat, the pillar took in the night the appearance of a column of fire, so as to be equally visible as by day. All attempts to give a rational explanation of the phenomenon are misplaced, since the writer, from whom alone we derive our information on the subject, clearly regarded it as miraculous; and both here and elsewhere (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19, 20, 24</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-5.htm">Numbers 12:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>) speaks of it as a form under which God was pleased to show himself. There is little doubt that fire and smoke signals were already used by commanders of armies for much the same purpose as that which God now accomplished in this way. The Egyptian documents of the period contain indications of the usage; and it is found among the Arabians, the Greeks, and the Persians. (See especially Q. Curt. <span class="accented">Vit.</span> Alex. 5:2; "Perticam, quae undique conspici posset, supra praetorium statuit, ex qua signum eminebat pariter omnibus conspicuum: observabatur ignis noctu, fiunus interdin.") The miracle was thus, in a certain sense, founded upon an existing custom, with the difference that God here gave the signals miraculously, which were wont to be given in a natural way by the human leaders of armies. He thus constituted himself the general of the host. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord went before them</span>. From Succoth at any rate; perhaps even on the journey from Rameses to Succoth. <span class="cmt_word">In a pillar of cloud</span>. The pillar was seen - the presence of Jehovah, though unseen, was believed to be in it, and to move it. <span class="cmt_word">To go by day and night</span>. Or, "so that they might march both by day and by night." Night marches are generally preferred by Orientals on account of the great heat of the days.
