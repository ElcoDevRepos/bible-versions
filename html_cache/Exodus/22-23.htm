In ancient Israelite society, these groups were particularly vulnerable due to the lack of a male protector or provider. The command reflects God's concern for justice and compassion, emphasizing the moral responsibility of the community to protect and care for those who cannot defend themselves. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical theme of justice for the oppressed, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a> and <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>.<p><b>and they cry out to Me in distress</b><br>The act of crying out to God signifies a plea for divine intervention and justice. In the biblical narrative, God is portrayed as a defender of the oppressed and a righteous judge who responds to the cries of those in distress. This is evident in the story of the Israelites in Egypt, where God hears their cries and delivers them from slavery (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-9</a>). The phrase underscores the belief that God is attentive to human suffering and responsive to the prayers of those who are wronged.<p><b>I will surely hear their cry</b><br>This assurance of God's attentiveness highlights His role as a just and compassionate deity who is actively involved in the lives of His people. The certainty of God's response serves as both a comfort to the oppressed and a warning to potential oppressors. It reflects the biblical principle that God is not indifferent to injustice and will act on behalf of those who are wronged. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, which affirms that God hears the cries of the righteous and delivers them from their troubles. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate justice and deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's compassion and commitment to justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The speaker in this verse, emphasizing His role as a just and compassionate deity who hears the cries of the oppressed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>- Refers to the vulnerable individuals, such as widows and orphans, mentioned in the surrounding context of <a href="/bsb/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22</a>, who are at risk of being mistreated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The original audience of the laws given in Exodus, who are being instructed on how to treat the vulnerable members of their society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>- The location where God delivered the laws to Moses, including this commandment, as part of the covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader and prophet who received the laws from God and communicated them to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassionate_justice.htm">God's Compassionate Justice</a></b><br>God is deeply concerned with justice and compassion, especially for those who are vulnerable and oppressed.

God singles out the most defenseless so that His people will show compassion, never exploitation.<p>&#8226; The warning is personal: &#8220;you.&#8221; No one is exempt. Just as Israel once suffered oppression (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17&#8211;18</a>), they must not pass oppression along.<p>&#8226; Mistreatment can be physical, financial, legal, or emotional. <a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1&#8211;2</a> shows God&#8217;s anger when leaders write laws that rob the needy. <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> calls caring for orphans and widows &#8220;pure and undefiled religion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The literal sense is plain: harming the vulnerable violates God&#8217;s revealed will and invites His judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they cry out to Me in distress</b><p>&#8226; God assumes the afflicted will pray&#8212;and He invites it. <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> says, &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears; He delivers them from all their troubles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Cry out&#8221; pictures urgency, pain, and faith. Like Hagar&#8217;s son (<a href="/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>) or Israel in slavery (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>), desperate prayer reaches heaven quickly.<p>&#8226; Their cry bypasses human courts; God Himself becomes their advocate (<a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This line reminds us that prayer is not a last resort but the sure path to divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will surely hear their cry</b><p>&#8226; The promise is emphatic: &#8220;I will surely hear.&#8221; God links His own honor to defending the helpless (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing implies action. In <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7&#8211;8</a> God both heard Israel and &#8220;came down to rescue&#8221; them.
