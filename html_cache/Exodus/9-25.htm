Egypt, known for its advanced civilization and powerful empire, was geographically centered around the Nile River. The land's fertility depended heavily on the Nile's inundation, making the impact of the hail particularly devastating. This event demonstrates God's power over the natural world and His ability to execute judgment on a national scale.<p><b>the hail struck down everything in the field</b><br>Hail is a rare and destructive weather phenomenon in Egypt, a region characterized by its arid climate. The severity of this plague is underscored by its ability to destroy everything in the fields, which were crucial for Egypt's agriculture-based economy. This judgment highlights God's control over creation and serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, such as Nut, the sky goddess, and Set, the god of storms.<p><b>both man and beast</b><br>The inclusion of both humans and animals in the destruction signifies the comprehensive nature of the judgment. In ancient Egyptian society, animals were not only vital for agriculture and transportation but also held religious significance. The loss of life among both humans and animals underscores the severity of the plague and serves as a reminder of the consequences of Pharaoh's hardened heart.<p><b>it beat down every plant of the field</b><br>The destruction of crops would have had catastrophic implications for Egypt's food supply, leading to potential famine. This phrase highlights the economic and social impact of the plague, as agriculture was the backbone of Egyptian society. The devastation of the crops can be seen as a fulfillment of God's warning to Pharaoh and a demonstration of His sovereignty over the land.<p><b>and stripped every tree</b><br>Trees, often symbols of life and prosperity, were also destroyed, indicating the totality of the devastation. In the biblical narrative, trees can represent stability and blessing, and their destruction signifies the removal of these blessings from Egypt. This act of stripping the trees can be seen as a precursor to the later plagues and a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance of the Israelites, as it demonstrates God's power to dismantle the natural order to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God demonstrated His power through the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God&#8217;s command to let the Israelites go.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from slavery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_hail.htm">The Plague of Hail</a></b><br>The seventh plague sent by God upon Egypt, demonstrating His power and judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God&#8217;s chosen people, who were spared from the devastation of the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The plague of hail demonstrates God's control over nature and His ability to execute judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to heed God's warnings serves as a caution against hardening our hearts to God's voice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_of_god's_people.htm">Protection of God's People</a></b><br>The Israelites were spared from the plague, illustrating God's protection and care for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_obedience.htm">Repentance and Obedience</a></b><br>The plagues serve as a call to repentance and obedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>While God&#8217;s judgment is severe, His mercy is evident in sparing those who belong to Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_25_God_s_power_creation_judgment.htm">How does Exodus 9:25 demonstrate God's power over creation and judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_from_Exodus_9_25.htm">What lessons can we learn about obedience from the Egyptians' experience in Exodus 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_25_and_God_s_covenant_link.htm">How does Exodus 9:25 connect with God's covenant promises to Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_see_God_s_authority_today.htm">In what ways can we recognize God's authority in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Exodus_9_25_on_obeying_God.htm">How should Exodus 9:25 influence our response to God's warnings and commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_25_vs_God_s_love_reconcile.htm">How does Exodus 9:25 align with the concept of a loving and merciful God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Exodus_9_25_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Exodus 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Theologians_on_Exodus_9_25_plague_severity.htm">How do theologians interpret the severity of the plague in Exodus 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_locusts_and_hail_plagues_align.htm">How does the destruction caused by the locusts (Exodus 10:15) align with the later plague of hail in Exodus 9, which supposedly ruined crops earlier?

The force is echoed later when &#8220;great hailstones&#8221; killed more Amorites than Israel&#8217;s swords (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s mastery over weather underscores His supremacy over Egypt&#8217;s sky-gods. <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a> speaks of another future hail judgment, reminding us that divine wrath can still manifest in the elements.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both man and beast</b><p>- The blow was indiscriminate.

Though severe, the plague also revealed mercy: those who heeded His warning were spared.
