A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making fifteen cubits approximately 22.5 feet. This precision underscores the importance of obedience and the sacredness of the Tabernacle as a dwelling place for God's presence among His people. The curtains served as a boundary, separating the holy from the common, and symbolizing the need for purity and holiness in approaching God. This separation can be seen as a precursor to the veil in the Temple, which was torn at the crucifixion of Jesus, symbolizing direct access to God through Christ (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p><b>with three posts and three bases</b><br>The use of three posts and bases for the curtains indicates a structured and stable design, ensuring the integrity of the Tabernacle's courtyard. The number three often holds symbolic significance in the Bible, representing completeness or divine perfection, as seen in the Trinity. The posts and bases were likely made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, materials that were both durable and symbolically significant. Bronze, in particular, is associated with judgment and strength, as seen in the bronze altar and the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). The posts and bases provided a firm foundation, much like the teachings of Christ provide a firm foundation for believers (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where these instructions are being applied.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The area surrounding the Tabernacle, which includes the entrance described in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are to construct the Tabernacle according to the divine instructions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_entrance.htm">The Entrance</a></b><br>The specific part of the Tabernacle's courtyard being described, emphasizing the order and structure God desires.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_attention_to_detail.htm">God's Attention to Detail</a></b><br>God cares about the specifics, as seen in the detailed instructions for the Tabernacle.

The Lord is giving Moses explicit, non-negotiable instructions for the courtyard of the tabernacle.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses curtains or veils to mark off what is holy (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;20</a>). Here, the courtyard curtains separate sacred space from common ground, reminding Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God is holy and distinct from sin (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The very act of God prescribing the details shows His interest in dwelling among His people in an orderly, purposeful way (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on one side</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pinpoints location: one specific span of the courtyard&#8217;s north or south side (compare <a href="/exodus/27-11.htm">Exodus 27:11, 27</a>:15).<p>&#8226; Every side mattered. Just as the church is &#8220;fitly framed together&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>), every aspect of God&#8217;s house had its appointed place.<p>&#8226; This detail guards against improvisation.

The courtyard bases hint at that future, immovable foundation.<p>&#8226; Metal bases also resisted decay, portraying permanence in the midst of a wilderness journey (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/27-14.htm">Exodus 27:14</a> is more than ancient architecture. God ordered a fifteen-cubit stretch of curtain, firmly set by three posts and three bases, to create a precise, balanced boundary around His dwelling. Every measurement, material, and placement reveals the Lord&#8217;s holiness, the necessity of an ordained way of approach, and the stability He provides. The verse invites us to honor God&#8217;s detailed instructions, trust His perfect order, and rest on the sure foundation He establishes for all who come to Him through the gate He has provided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The hangings of one side.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">at one side. </span>On three sides of the court--the south, the west, and the north--there was to be no interruption in the hangings--no entrance or gateway. But it was otherwise on the fourth side, towards the east. Here was to be the entrance to the court, and here consequently the line of hangings was to be broken in the middle. A curtain, similar to that at the east end of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>), but hung on four pillars instead of five, and capable of being drawn up of down, was to give admission to the court on this side, and was to occupy twenty cubits out of the fifty which formed the entire width of the court. On either side would remain a space of fifteen cubits, which was to be occupied by "hangings," similar to those on the other three sides of the court. Each of these lengths of fifteen cubits required three pillars for its support. Thus the pillars on the east side were ten, as on the west.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">The hangings of</span> <span class="cmt_word">one side.</span> Literally, "of one shoulder."
