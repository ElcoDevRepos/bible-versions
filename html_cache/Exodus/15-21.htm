Her role in leading the women in song and dance highlights the importance of women in worship and celebration. This moment follows the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, where God delivered the Israelites from the Egyptians. Miriam's response is a spontaneous act of worship, reflecting the communal nature of Israelite worship. The phrase "sang back to them" suggests a call-and-response style, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, emphasizing communal participation in worship.<p><b>&#8220;Sing to the LORD,</b><br>The call to sing to the LORD is an invitation to worship and praise God for His mighty acts. Singing is a central element of Hebrew worship, as seen throughout the Psalms. This phrase underscores the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and His role as the deliverer of Israel. It is a reminder that worship is directed to God alone, who is worthy of all praise.<p><b>for He is highly exalted;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's supreme power and authority. The exaltation of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His majesty and holiness. In the context of the Exodus, God's exaltation is demonstrated through His victory over the Egyptians, showcasing His power over the forces of nature and human armies. This exaltation is a foretaste of the ultimate exaltation of Christ, who is seated at the right hand of God.<p><b>the horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to the destruction of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea, a pivotal event in Israel's history. The imagery of horse and rider being thrown into the sea symbolizes the complete and miraculous defeat of the Egyptians, who were pursuing the Israelites. This act of deliverance is a testament to God's protection and faithfulness to His covenant people. It also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who delivers His people from spiritual bondage. The crossing of the Red Sea is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the believer's passage from death to life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/miriam.htm">Miriam</a></b><br>The sister of Moses and Aaron, a prophetess, and a leader among the Israelite women.

This echoing style lets every Israelite&#8212;men, women, and children&#8212;own the victory just experienced (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Her leadership in worship fulfills earlier glimpses of her calling (<a href="/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4-8</a>) and foreshadows her prominence alongside Moses and Aaron (<a href="/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment shows that public praise is not reserved for a select few; it is a family affair where testimony is repeated so the memory never fades (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20-25</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sing to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The imperative &#8220;Sing&#8221; is a summons to active, vocal gratitude.

It calls everyone to active praise (&#8220;Sing to the LORD&#8221;), grounds that praise in God&#8217;s incomparable majesty (&#8220;for He is highly exalted&#8221;), and anchors it in a concrete act of deliverance (&#8220;the horse and rider He has thrown into the sea&#8221;). The verse teaches that worship flows naturally from witnessing God&#8217;s mighty salvation, assuring believers that the One who overthrew Pharaoh remains forever exalted and worthy of song.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Miriam answered them.</span>--Miriam and her maidens at the close of each portion of the "Song"--i.e., at the end of <a href="/exodus/15-5.htm" title="The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.">Exodus 15:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-10.htm" title="You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.">Exodus 15:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-12.htm" title="You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.">Exodus 15:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-18.htm" title="The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.">Exodus 15:18</a>--sang the refrain which is here given--a refrain very slightly altered from the opening verse of the "Song" itself, marking, no doubt, the time with their timbrels, and moving gracefully through a stately and solemn dance.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Miriam</span> <span class="cmt_word">answered them.</span> Miriam, with her chorus of women, answered the chorus of men, responding at the termination of each stanza or separate part of the ode with the refrain, "Sing ye to the Lord," etc. (See the "Introduction" to this chapter.) While responding, the female chorus both danced and struck their tambourines. This use of dancing in a religious ceremonial, so contrary to Western ideas of decorum, is quite consonant with Oriental practice, both ancient and modern. Other examples of it in Scripture are David's dancing before the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>), the dancing of Jephthah's daughter (<a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>), and that of the virgins of Shiloh (<a href="/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a>). It is also mentioned with approval in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; el. 4). Dancing was practised as a religious ceremony in Egypt, in Phrygia, in Thrace, by the Phoenicians, by the Syrians, by the Romans, and others. In the nature of things there is clearly nothing unfitting or indecorous in a dedication to religion of what has been called "the poetry of gesture." But human infirmity has connected such terrible abuses with the practice that the purer religions have either discarded it or else denied it admission into their ceremonial. It still however lingers in Mohammedanism among those who are called "dancing dervishes," whose extraordinary performances are regarded as acts of devotion. <p> CHAPTER 15:22-27 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Miriam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mir&#183;y&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4813.htm">Strong's 4813: </a> </span><span class="str2">Miriam -- a sister of Aaron, also a man of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sang back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ta&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
