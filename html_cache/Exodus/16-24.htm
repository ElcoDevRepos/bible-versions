The context is the provision of manna in the wilderness, a miraculous sustenance from God. The Israelites were instructed to gather only enough manna for each day, except on the sixth day when they were to gather enough for two days to honor the Sabbath rest (<a href="/exodus/16-5.htm">Exodus 16:5</a>). This act of setting aside manna until morning was a test of faith and obedience, reflecting the broader theme of reliance on God's provision. The command to set aside manna for the Sabbath prefigures the concept of rest and trust in God's provision, which is fulfilled in Christ, who offers spiritual rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>and it did not smell or contain any maggots</b><br>This phrase underscores the miraculous nature of God's provision. Normally, manna would spoil if kept overnight (<a href="/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20</a>), but in this instance, it remained fresh, demonstrating God's control over creation and His ability to sustain His people. The absence of spoilage is a sign of divine intervention, emphasizing God's faithfulness and the importance of following His instructions. This preservation of manna can be seen as a type of Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who is incorruptible and provides eternal sustenance. The miracle of the manna not spoiling on the Sabbath also points to the sanctity and divine blessing of the Sabbath rest, a principle that finds its ultimate fulfillment in the rest offered through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
