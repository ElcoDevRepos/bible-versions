The Israelites, who had been enslaved for centuries, found favor with their Egyptian neighbors, which was crucial for their eventual exodus. This divine favor is reminiscent of Joseph's experience in Egypt, where God granted him favor in the eyes of Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>). Theologically, this demonstrates God's providence and His plan to fulfill His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>). The favor also foreshadows the plundering of the Egyptians, as the Israelites would leave with silver, gold, and clothing (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>), fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would leave their place of bondage with great possessions.<p><b>Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh&#8217;s officials and by the people.</b><br>Moses' high regard among the Egyptians, despite being the leader of the enslaved Israelites, underscores his unique role as God's chosen deliverer. This respect likely stemmed from the signs and wonders performed through him, which demonstrated the power of the God of Israel. Historically, Moses' position as a former member of the Egyptian royal household (<a href="/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>) may have contributed to his standing among the officials. This respect is significant as it contrasts with Pharaoh's hardened heart, highlighting the division between the ruler and his people. Moses as a type of Christ is evident here; just as Moses was a mediator between God and the Israelites, Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). Moses' leadership and the respect he commanded prefigure Christ's authority and the reverence He would receive from both His followers and even some of His adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is orchestrating the events leading to the Exodus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, enslaved in Egypt, whom God is preparing to deliver.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, who are witnessing the power of God through the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who is gaining respect and favor in Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_officials.htm">Pharaoh&#8217;s Officials</a></b><br>The Egyptian leaders who are beginning to recognize Moses' authority and the power of his God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor.htm">Divine Favor</a></b><br>God's ability to grant favor in the eyes of others is a recurring theme in Scripture.

This wasn&#8217;t human persuasion; it was divine intervention.<p>- Earlier, God had promised this outcome: &#8220;I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21</a>). The fulfillment here shows the absolute reliability of His word.<p>- Similar scenes appear elsewhere, underscoring the pattern of God bestowing favor on His servants&#8212;Joseph in prison (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>) and Daniel before Babylonian officials (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: when God purposes something, even those outside the covenant community can become unexpected allies, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>, &#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt</b><p>- Moses&#8217; esteem grew despite his confrontations with Pharaoh.

Fear mingled with respect, producing willingness to bless the Israelites with silver, gold, and clothing (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-38.htm">Psalm 105:38</a>).<p>- The scene anticipates future moments when nations acknowledge God&#8217;s hand on His people, as <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a> foretells, &#8220;Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/11-3.htm">Exodus 11:3</a> records God supernaturally turning Egyptian hearts toward both Israel as a nation and Moses as an individual.

Moreover, it is highly improbable that any other writer than himself would have so baldly and bluntly designated Moses as <span class="cmt_word">the man Moses</span>. (Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1, 13, 15</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6, 7</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-2.htm">Joshua 22:2, 4</a>; etc.) The "greatness" which Moses had now attained was due to the powers which he had shown. First of all, he had confounded the magicians (<a href="/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18, 19</a>); then he had so far impressed the courtiers that a number of them took advantage of one of his warnings and thereby saved their cattle and slaves (<a href="/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>). Finally, he had forced the entire Court to acknowledge that it lay in his power to destroy or save Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>). He had after that parleyed with the king very much as an equal (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 8-11; 16 -18). It is no wonder that the Egyptians, who regarded their king as a "great god," were deeply impressed. <p> CHAPTER 11:4 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/11-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
