This reflects a recurring theme in the wilderness journey, where the Israelites often expressed dissatisfaction despite God's provision. The act of grumbling is significant as it demonstrates a lack of faith and trust in God's plan and leadership. Moses, as the appointed leader, often bore the brunt of the people's complaints, which foreshadows the challenges faced by leaders who are called to guide God's people. This grumbling can be seen as a precursor to later rebellions, such as in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, where the people's lack of faith leads to severe consequences.<p><b>saying, &#8220;What are we to drink?&#8221;</b><br>The immediate context is the Israelites' arrival at Marah, where the water was bitter and undrinkable. This question highlights their physical need and desperation, but also their spiritual short-sightedness. Instead of seeking God in prayer, they directed their frustration at Moses. This incident is a test of faith, similar to other trials in the wilderness, such as the lack of food in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>. The question also points to a deeper spiritual thirst, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who offers "living water" (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>). The physical thirst of the Israelites can be seen as a type pointing to the spiritual thirst that only Jesus can satisfy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_shur.htm">The Wilderness of Shur</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites traveled after crossing the Red Sea, facing the challenge of finding drinkable water.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marah.htm">Marah</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites found bitter water, leading to their grumbling against Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The underlying event where God tests the faith of the Israelites and ultimately provides for their needs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The Israelites' grumbling reflects a lack of trust in God's ability to provide.

Three days earlier, Israel walked through the Red Sea on dry ground (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>). They sang the triumphant &#8220;Song of Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1&#8211;19</a>), proclaiming, &#8220;The LORD is my strength and my song&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>). Yet once they reached Marah and found only bitter water (<a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>), their celebration turned to complaint. <a href="/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12&#8211;13</a> notes the contrast: &#8220;Then they believed His promises and sang His praise. Yet they soon forgot His works.&#8221; The &#8220;So&#8221; reminds us how quickly gratitude can shift when circumstances test faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people grumbled</b><p>Grumbling is more than voicing concern; it is a heart posture of distrust. Scripture repeatedly shows Israel murmuring in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>; 17:3; <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>). Paul warns believers, &#8220;Do not grumble, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by the destroying angel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>). Grumbling:<p>&#8226; focuses on lack rather than God&#8217;s past faithfulness.<p>&#8226; spreads discontent among the community (<a href="/numbers/14-36.htm">Numbers 14:36</a>).<p>&#8226; invites discipline instead of blessing (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Moses</b><p>Their frustration aimed at their God-appointed leader. Yet Moses would later tell them, &#8220;Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>). Rejecting God&#8217;s delegated authority is ultimately rejecting God Himself (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/romans/13-2.htm">Romans 13:2</a>). Moses had just risked his life to lead them out of Egypt; still, the people transferred blame to him instead of seeking God. It&#8217;s a cautionary tale whenever we aim our complaints at human leaders for problems only God can solve.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>What we say reveals what fills the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; <a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>). Their words crystallized the inward fear already taking root. James describes the tongue as steering the whole person (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5&#8211;6</a>); here, speech steered the camp toward collective anxiety. Speaking faith would have changed the climate; instead, their words fueled panic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What are we to drink?&#8221;</b><p>Their question was natural; water is essential. Yet the underlying issue was unbelief. God had just conquered Pharaoh&#8217;s army; surely He could supply water. In the very next verse, &#8220;the LORD showed him a tree, and when he cast it into the waters, they were made sweet&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>). God turned bitterness into refreshment, foreshadowing how Christ would satisfy every thirst (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13&#8211;14</a>; 7:37&#8211;38; <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>). <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2&#8211;3</a> explains that wilderness tests teach dependence: &#8220;that He might humble you&#8230;to let you know that man does not live on bread alone.&#8221; Israel&#8217;s question should have been a prayer, not a protest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a> captures a swift shift from praise to complaint. The hinge word &#8220;So&#8221; connects deliverance to doubt; grumbling exposes a distrustful heart; targeting Moses shows rebellion against God&#8217;s appointed leadership; their spoken words spread fear; and the demand, &#8220;What are we to drink?&#8221; overlooks the God who supplies living water. The verse warns us against murmuring and calls us to remember past mercies, respect godly authority, guard our speech, and trust the Lord to meet every need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people murmured against Moses</span>. As they had already done on the western shores of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11, 12</a>), and as they were about to do so often before their wanderings were over. (See below, <a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-41.htm">Numbers 16:41</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27</a>, etc.) "Murmuring" was the common mode in which they vented their spleen, when anything went ill with them; and as Moses had persuaded them to quit Egypt, the murmuring was chiefly against him. The men who serve a nation best are during their lifetime least appreciated. <span class="cmt_word">What shall we drink?</span> Few disappointments are harder to bear than that of the man, who after long hours of thirst thinks that he has obtained wherewith to quench his intolerable longing, and on raising the cup to his lips, finds the draught so nauseous that he cannot swallow it. Very unpalatable water is swallowed when the thirst is great (<span class="accented">Eothen</span>, p. 197). But there is a limit beyond which nature will not go. There "may be water, water everywhere, yet not a drop to drink." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grumbled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;l&#333;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3885.htm">Strong's 3885: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stop, to stay permanently, to be obstinate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are we to drink?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#353;&#183;teh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8354.htm">Strong's 8354: </a> </span><span class="str2">To imbibe</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/15-24.htm">OT Law: Exodus 15:24 The people murmured against Moses saying What (Exo.
