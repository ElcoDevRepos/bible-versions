The context is a legal code given to the Israelites, emphasizing fairness and the prevention of excessive punishment. It highlights the importance of intent and outcome in determining guilt and punishment. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about mercy and justice (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>).<p><b>as long as the other can get up and walk around outside with his staff</b><br>The ability to walk with a staff indicates recovery and a return to normal life, suggesting that the injury was not life-threatening. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a staff was a symbol of authority and support, often used by shepherds and travelers. This requirement ensures that the injured party is genuinely able to resume daily activities, reflecting a concern for the well-being of individuals within the community.<p><b>Nevertheless, he must compensate the man for his lost work</b><br>Compensation for lost work underscores the economic impact of injuries and the responsibility to make restitution. This reflects the broader biblical principle of restitution found in passages like <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-7</a>. It emphasizes the value of labor and the need to address financial losses, ensuring that justice includes restoration.<p><b>and see that he is completely healed</b><br>The requirement for complete healing highlights the importance of holistic care and responsibility for one's actions. It suggests a community-oriented approach to justice, where the well-being of individuals is prioritized. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on love and care for one's neighbor (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). The focus on healing also points to the ultimate healing and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who is described as the Great Physician (<a href="/mark/2-17.htm">Mark 2:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_injured_person.htm">The Injured Person</a></b><br>This individual has been harmed in a conflict but is recovering to the point of being able to walk with a staff.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assailant.htm">The Assailant</a></b><br>The person responsible for injuring the other, who is required to compensate for the victim's lost time and ensure their healing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_ancient_israel.htm">The Context of Ancient Israel</a></b><br>This law is part of the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, reflecting God's justice and care for community welfare.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_staff.htm">The Staff</a></b><br>Symbolizes the injured person's recovery and ability to move, indicating partial healing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_requirement_of_compensation.htm">The Requirement of Compensation</a></b><br>Reflects the principle of restitution and responsibility within the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_responsibility.htm">Justice and Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage teaches that those who cause harm are responsible for making amends, reflecting God's justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_care.htm">Community Care</a></b><br>The requirement for the assailant to ensure the victim's healing underscores the importance of community support and care for one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_healing.htm">Restoration and Healing</a></b><br>The focus on the victim's complete healing points to God's desire for restoration and wholeness in relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_accountability.htm">Personal Accountability</a></b><br>This law encourages individuals to take responsibility for their actions and the consequences that follow.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>While justice is served, the underlying principle is one of compassion and ensuring the well-being of others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_21_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 21:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_19_s_role_in_injury_disputes.htm">How does Exodus 21:19 guide us in resolving personal injury disputes today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_pay_for_lost_time_teach_duty.htm">What does "pay for the lost time" teach about responsibility and restitution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_19_vs_Jesus_Forgiveness_link.htm">How does Exodus 21:19 connect with Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_restitution_in_conflicts.htm">In what ways can we apply the principle of restitution in modern conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_19_Justice_harmony.htm">How does Exodus 21:19 reflect God's concern for justice and community harmony?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_19_vs_modern_justice_views.htm">How does Exodus 21:19 align with modern views on justice and compensation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_19_and_Israelite_legal_norms.htm">What does Exodus 21:19 reveal about ancient Israelite legal practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Modern_view_on_Exodus_21_19_restitution.htm">How should Christians interpret the concept of restitution in Exodus 21:19 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_are_moses_and_jesus_similar.htm">What similarities exist between Moses and Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_bible's_view_on_snakes.htm">What is the biblical perspective on snakes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/2_kings_13_21__can_bones_revive_the_dead.htm">2 Kings 13:21 -

Earlier in the chapter God had already decreed, &#8220;Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must surely be put to death&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>). Here, however, the victim does not die; therefore the attacker is released from the death penalty. Justice is still required, but it is proportionate to the injury, echoing the principle behind <a href="/leviticus/24-19.htm">Leviticus 24:19</a> &#8211; &#8220;If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him.&#8221; God&#8217;s law protects life while also guarding against excessive retribution (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a> and <a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As long as the other can get up and walk around outside with his staff</b><p>The ability to rise and move about&#8212;though aided by a staff&#8212;demonstrates that the wound is not permanently debilitating or fatal. This visible proof settles the question of whether a life-for-life penalty is appropriate. The staff signals weakness, yet mobility proves recovery is underway. Justice in the Old Testament consistently weighs actual harm, not merely intent (see <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> for the need of clear evidence). The scene also anticipates compassionate concern for the wounded, a theme Jesus illustrated in <a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a> when the Good Samaritan &#8220;set him on his own animal&#8221; and ensured ongoing care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nevertheless, he must compensate the man for his lost work</b><p>Though spared harsher judgment, the striker assumes full financial responsibility. Practical restitution is required:<p>&#8226; Cover the victim&#8217;s wages for the time he is bedridden.<p>&#8226; Ensure no family suffers lack because of the altercation.<p>This reflects <a href="/exodus/22-14.htm">Exodus 22:14</a>, where borrowing property obligates repayment if damaged. It also resonates with <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a> on restoring what was lost &#8220;and add a fifth part more.&#8221; God&#8217;s law values productivity and provides a tangible avenue for repentance: repay what was taken, even if unintentionally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And see that he is completely healed</b><p>Restitution is not finished until the victim is &#8220;completely healed.&#8221; The offender must pay for medical treatment and any related expenses until full recovery. In modern terms, God mandates both lost wages and medical coverage. This holistic view of justice anticipates the compassion modeled by Christ, who &#8220;healed them all&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a>) and by Paul, who stayed with the sick in <a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a> until they were restored. It underscores the biblical call to bear one another&#8217;s burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), ensuring the injured party is not left half-helped.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-19.htm">Exodus 21:19</a> affirms that when harm is not fatal, justice shifts from retribution to restitution. The aggressor avoids capital punishment but must: acknowledge fault, reimburse lost income, and fund full healing. God&#8217;s law thus protects life, deters violence, and promotes restoration&#8212;a standard that still guides believers toward responsible, compassionate reconciliation today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff.</span>--The charge of murder was not to be kept hanging over a man indefinitely.
