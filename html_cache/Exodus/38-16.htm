The curtains served as a boundary, separating the sacred space from the common areas. This separation highlights the holiness of God and the need for purity when approaching Him. The courtyard's design reflects God's instructions to Moses on Mount Sinai, emphasizing obedience and reverence. The use of curtains also symbolizes the veil that separates humanity from the divine, a theme echoed in the New Testament when the temple veil is torn at Christ's crucifixion, signifying direct access to God through Jesus.<p><b>were made of finely spun linen.</b><br>Finely spun linen was a luxurious and costly material, indicating the importance and sacredness of the Tabernacle. Linen was often associated with purity and righteousness, as seen in Revelation where the saints are described as wearing fine linen. The use of such material underscores the need for holiness in worship and the presentation of offerings. Linen's durability and quality also reflect the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people.
