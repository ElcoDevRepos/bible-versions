The use of a basket signifies order and preparation, ensuring that the offerings are presented in a manner befitting their sacred purpose. Baskets were common in ancient Israel for carrying goods, and their use here underscores the practical aspects of worship. The basket can also symbolize the gathering of God's provisions, reminiscent of the manna collected in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>).<p><b>and present them in the basket</b><br>The act of presenting the offerings in the basket highlights the importance of intentionality in worship. This presentation is a formal act of dedication, setting apart the items for God's service. It reflects the broader biblical principle of offering the first and best to God, as seen in the sacrifices of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>) and the instructions for firstfruits (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>). The presentation also foreshadows the ultimate offering of Christ, who was presented as the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><b>along with the bull and the two rams</b><br>The bull and two rams are central to the consecration ceremony for Aaron and his sons. The bull was used for a sin offering, symbolizing atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>). The two rams served different purposes: one for a burnt offering, representing complete dedication to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>), and the other for a ram of ordination, signifying the priests' consecration to their sacred duties (<a href="/exodus/29-22.htm">Exodus 29:22-26</a>). These sacrifices prefigure Christ's atoning work, as He is both the sin offering and the one who consecrates believers as a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The use of multiple animals underscores the comprehensive nature of the atonement and dedication required for those serving in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law, including the instructions for the consecration of the priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, chosen by God to serve in the tabernacle.

That same idea fuels Paul&#8217;s call to &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The priesthood begins not with what they take from God but with what they give Him&#8212;everything He first supplied.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with the bull</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;along with the bull&#8230;&#8221; ties the bread to the sin offering that immediately follows (<a href="/exodus/29-10.htm">Exodus 29:10-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The bull&#8217;s blood provides atonement for Aaron and his sons (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-7</a>). Without cleansing, no priestly service can even start (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing the basket beside the bull reminds us that fellowship (symbolized by bread) rests on forgiveness (symbolized by shed blood).<p>&#8226; It foreshadows Christ, who combines the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-48.htm">John 6:48-51</a>) with the once-for-all sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the two rams</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the two rams.&#8221; Each ram has its own purpose (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Ram #1 is the burnt offering&#8212;everything consumed on the altar, expressing total surrender (<a href="/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Ram #2 is the ordination offering; its blood is applied to the priests&#8217; right ear, thumb, and big toe, setting their hearing, working, and walking apart for God (<a href="/leviticus/8-22.htm">Leviticus 8:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Together the rams illustrate consecration&#8217;s two sides: wholehearted devotion and practical holiness. Abraham&#8217;s substitutionary ram (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>) and the Lamb of God who takes away sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>) both echo here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/29-3.htm">Exodus 29:3</a> gathers bread, basket, bull, and rams into a single moment that launches Israel&#8217;s priesthood. The basket of unleavened bread shows provision and purity; presenting that basket underscores complete surrender; the bull secures atonement; the two rams express total devotion and lifelong consecration. The verse teaches that ministry to God begins with forgiveness, is sustained by His provision, and is lived out in wholehearted, set-apart service&#8212;realities ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our perfect High Priest and final sacrifice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">them in the basket.</span> Rather, "Thou shalt <span class="accented">offer</span> them."
