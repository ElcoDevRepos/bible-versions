Pharaoh's army was one of the most powerful of the ancient world, equipped with chariots that were the cutting-edge military technology of the time. Chariots provided speed and mobility, making them a fearsome weapon in battle. The mention of "all Pharaoh&#8217;s horses and chariots" underscores the seriousness of the threat and the desperation of the situation for the Israelites. This pursuit reflects Pharaoh's hardened heart and his refusal to let the Israelites go, despite the plagues that had devastated Egypt. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith for the Israelites, who must trust in God's deliverance against overwhelming odds.<p><b>pursued the Israelites and overtook them</b><br>The pursuit and overtaking of the Israelites by the Egyptians is a critical moment of tension. The Israelites, having recently been freed from slavery, are now facing the possibility of being captured or killed. This situation is a test of their faith in God's promise of deliverance. Theologically, this moment foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who overcomes sin and death. The pursuit also serves as a reminder of the persistent nature of evil, which often seeks to reclaim those who have been set free.<p><b>as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth,</b><br>The location by the sea is significant, as it places the Israelites in a seemingly impossible situation, trapped between the sea and the approaching Egyptian army. Pi-hahiroth is believed to be a location near the Red Sea, though its exact location is uncertain. The geographical setting underscores the miraculous nature of the subsequent crossing of the Red Sea, which is a pivotal event in the narrative of the Exodus. This setting also serves as a metaphor for the believer's journey, where faith often requires trusting God in seemingly impossible circumstances.<p><b>opposite Baal-zephon.</b><br>Baal-zephon was likely a location associated with a Canaanite deity, possibly a mountain or a sanctuary. The mention of Baal-zephon may indicate a place where the Egyptians believed their gods held power. Theologically, the crossing of the Red Sea opposite Baal-zephon can be seen as a demonstration of the superiority of the God of Israel over the gods of Egypt. This event prefigures the ultimate victory of God over all false gods and powers, as seen in the triumph of Christ over sin and death. The presence of Baal-zephon in the narrative highlights the spiritual dimension of the conflict, where God's power is revealed in the deliverance of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God and pursued the Israelites after initially letting them go.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>Representing the military might of Egypt, including horses, chariots, horsemen, and troops, they pursued the Israelites to bring them back into slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, recently freed from slavery in Egypt, now facing a seemingly insurmountable obstacle at the Red Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pi_hahiroth.htm">Pi Hahiroth</a></b><br>A location near the Red Sea where the Israelites camped, strategically significant as it seemed to trap them between the sea and the Egyptian army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal_zephon.htm">Baal Zephon</a></b><br>A location opposite Pi Hahiroth, possibly a place of worship for a Canaanite deity, symbolizing the spiritual battle between the God of Israel and pagan gods.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>The Israelites were led to a place where they seemed trapped, yet it was part of God's plan to demonstrate His power and deliverance.

Though the Egyptians do not represent cavalry in any of their battle pieces, yet there is abundant testimony that they employed them. Diodorus Siculus gives his Sesostris 24,000 cavalry to 27,000 chariots (Book i. 54, ? 4). Shishak invaded Judaea with 60,000 (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>). Herodotus makes Amasis lead an army on horseback (ii. 162). The Egyptian monuments appear to make frequent mention of cavalry as forming a portion of the armed force. (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. ii., pp. 68, 70, 72, 83, &c, vol. iv., 41, 44, 45, &c.) It is suspected that some conventional rules of art prevented the representation of cavalry in the sculptures, which never show us an Egyptian, and but rarely a foreigner, on horseback.<p><span class= "bld">And his army</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., his infantry.</span> The host of this Pharaoh, like that of Shishak (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>), consisted apparently of the three arms, cavalry infantry, and chariots.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh</span> Rather, "all the chariot horses."

It must have taken Pharaoh a day to hear of their march from Etham, at least another day to collect his troops, and three or four days to effect the march from Tanis to Pi-hahiroth.
