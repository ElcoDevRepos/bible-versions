Moses, acting as a mediator between God and Pharaoh, demonstrates the effectiveness of righteous prayer (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). It also underscores God's responsiveness to His chosen leader, affirming Moses' role as a prophet and leader of Israel. This interaction reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God listens and acts according to His divine will and purpose.<p><b>and the frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died</b><br>The death of the frogs signifies the end of the second plague, which was a direct challenge to the Egyptian god Heqet, often depicted as a frog and associated with fertility and childbirth. This event illustrates God's supremacy over the Egyptian deities, reinforcing the theme of divine judgment against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>). The widespread death of the frogs in various locations&#8212;houses, courtyards, and fields&#8212;emphasizes the totality of God's control over creation and His ability to bring about both judgment and relief.

They simply died--died where they were--in thousands and tens of thousands, so that they had to be "gathered upon heaps." And "the land stank."
