This feast commemorates the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt, where they did not have time to let their bread rise. Unleavened bread, or matzah, symbolizes purity and separation from sin, as leaven often represents sin and corruption in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The seven days signify completeness and perfection, reflecting a complete separation from the old life of bondage.<p><b>Nothing leavened may be found among you,</b><br>The prohibition against leaven during this period underscores the importance of removing sin and impurity from one's life. In a broader biblical context, leaven is often used metaphorically to describe the pervasive nature of sin (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>). The removal of leaven from the home serves as a physical representation of spiritual cleansing and dedication to God. This practice also foreshadows the sinless nature of Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>nor shall leaven be found anywhere within your borders.</b><br>This command extends beyond individual households to the entire community, emphasizing communal holiness and collective responsibility. The thoroughness of this search for leaven reflects the need for vigilance in maintaining purity and holiness. It also highlights the unity of the Israelite community in their covenant relationship with God. The absence of leaven within the borders can be seen as a type of the future kingdom of God, where sin will be completely eradicated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is conveying God's commandments to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are being led out of Egypt and are commanded to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites are being delivered, symbolizing bondage and sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A seven-day observance following Passover, commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their haste in leaving, which did not allow time for their bread to rise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaven.htm">Leaven</a></b><br>Symbolically represents sin and corruption, which is to be removed from the Israelites' homes during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_leaven.htm">Symbolism of Leaven</a></b><br>Leaven represents sin and corruption.

This refers to the Feast of Unleavened Bread immediately following Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The seven-day span marks a complete, divinely appointed period&#8212;long enough to shape habit and memory. Israel&#8217;s diet became a living sermon reminding every household of God&#8217;s swift deliverance from Egypt when there was no time for dough to rise (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses seven to picture fullness or perfection (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). Here it highlights the total commitment God called for: not a moment of the feast was to be mixed with the old, leavened way.<p>&#8226; For believers today, Paul picks up this imagery: &#8220;Cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be a new batch, since you are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>). Living &#8220;unleavened&#8221; means embracing our new identity in Christ without compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nothing leavened may be found among you</b><p>&#8226; The command tightens: no leavened product could even remain in the house (<a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>). Leaven, tiny yet influential, pictures sin&#8217;s pervasive effect.<p>&#8226; By sweeping out every crumb, Israel dramatized wholehearted repentance&#8212;renouncing not only visible transgressions but hidden attitudes (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus warned of &#8220;the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>)&#8212;teaching that even small doses of hypocrisy or false doctrine spread quickly.<p>&#8226; Paul echoes, &#8220;Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). The call is not partial but thorough, guarding both personal life and fellowship from contaminating influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor shall leaven be found anywhere within your borders</b><p>&#8226; The passage expands from private dwellings to the nation as a whole: no leaven &#8220;within your borders&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a>). A corporate holiness was required; individual obedience contributed to communal purity.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s entire territory became a stage displaying God&#8217;s redeeming power. Every city, field, and village stood in solidarity, testifying that the Lord alone brought them out (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-4.htm">Deuteronomy 16:4</a> reiterates this broader scope, reinforcing that holiness is not merely personal but societal.<p>&#8226; Practically, the ban on leaven placed neighbors in mutual accountability. Likewise, the church today is charged to uphold collective purity&#8212;restoring a sinning brother gently yet firmly (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>) and &#8220;pursuing holiness&#8221; together (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a> layers a threefold command that moves from individual action to shared responsibility: eat only unleavened bread, remove all leaven from your homes, and ensure none exists anywhere in the land. Each step underscores God&#8217;s desire for complete separation from the old life of bondage and wholehearted identification with His redeeming work. In Christ, the ultimate Passover Lamb, we now live out this call&#8212;casting off sin&#8217;s leaven and celebrating the freedom of a cleansed, unleavened life together.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Here again the injunctions are mere repetitious of commands already given in ch. 12.
