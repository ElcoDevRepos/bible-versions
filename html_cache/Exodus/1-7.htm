The Israelites' rapid increase is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2 and 15</a>:5, where He assures Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars. This growth signifies God's blessing and faithfulness to His covenant people. The Hebrew word for "fruitful" (&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;, parah) is often associated with divine blessing and prosperity, indicating that the Israelites' multiplication was under God's providential care.<p><b>they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous,</b><br>The multiplication of the Israelites is a testament to God's promise to make them a great nation. This phrase highlights the exponential growth of the Israelite population during their time in Egypt, which sets the stage for the events of the Exodus. The use of "exceedingly numerous" underscores the overwhelming presence of the Israelites in Egypt, which would later lead to the Egyptians' fear and subsequent oppression of them. This growth can be seen as a precursor to the fulfillment of God's plan to deliver His people and establish them in the Promised Land.<p><b>so that the land was filled with them.</b><br>The phrase "the land was filled with them" indicates the significant impact the Israelites had on the land of Egypt. This fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham also foreshadows the future occupation of the Promised Land by the Israelites. The land being "filled" with Israelites can be seen as a type of the future Kingdom of God, where God's people will inhabit the earth. This phrase also sets the stage for the tension between the Egyptians and the Israelites, as the Egyptians begin to perceive the Israelites as a threat due to their vast numbers. This tension ultimately leads to the enslavement of the Israelites, setting the stage for God's redemptive work through Moses, a type of Christ, who will lead His people out of bondage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob (Israel), who were living in Egypt at this time.

Egypt was a particularly healthy country, and both men and animals were abnormally prolific there. Grain was so plentiful that want, which is the ordinary check on population, was almost unknown. The Egyptian kings for many years would look favourably on the growth of the Hebrew people, which strengthened their eastern frontier, the quarter on which they were most open to attack. God's blessing was, moreover, upon the people, which he had promised to make "as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore, for multitude" (see <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>). On the actual extent of the multiplication and the time that it occupied, see the comment on <a href="/context/exodus/12-37.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.">Exodus 12:37-41</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The land</span>--i.e., where they dwelt--Goshen (<a href="/context/genesis/47-4.htm" title="They said morever to Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.">Genesis 47:4-6</a>)--which seems to have been the more eastern portion of the Delta.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-14.</span> - Here the real narrative of Exodus begins. The history of the Israelites from and after the death of Joseph is entered on. The first point touched is <span class="cmt_word">their rapid multiplication</span>. The next their falling under the dominion of a <span class="cmt_word">new king</span>. The third, <span class="cmt_word">his mode of action under the circumstances</span>. It is remarkable that the narrative contains no notes of time. How long the increase continued before the new king arose, how long it went on before he noticed it, how long the attempt was made to cheek it by mere severity of labour, we are not told. Some considerable duration of time is implied, both for the multiplication (ver. 7) and for the oppression (ver. 11-14); but the narrator is so absorbed in the matters which he has to communicate that the question what time these matters occupied does not seem even to occur to him. And so it is with the sacred narrative frequently - perhaps we should say, generally. The chronological element is regarded as of slight importance; "A thousand years in the Lord's sight are but as yesterday" - "one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." Where a profane writer would have been to the last degree definite and particular, a sacred writer is constantly vague and indeterminate. We have in the Bible nothing like an exact continuous chronology. Certain general Chronological ideas may be obtained from the Bible; but in order to construct anything like a complete chronological scheme, frequent reference has to be made to profane writers and monuments, and such a scheme must be mainly dependent on these references. Archbishop Ussher's dates, inserted into the margin of so many of our Bibles, are the private speculations of an individual on the subject of mundane chronology, and must not be regarded as in any way authoritative. Their primary basis is profane history; and, though taking into consideration all the Scriptural numbers, they do not consistently follow any single rule with respect to them. Sometimes the authority of the Septuagint, sometimes that of the Hebrew text, is preferred; and the result arrived at is in a high degree uncertain and arbitrary. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt from "seventy souls" to "six hundred thousand that were men" (Genesis 12:37) - a number which may fairly be said to imply a total of at least two millions - has been declared to be "impossible," and to stamp the whole narrative of Exodus with the character of unreality and romance. Manifestly, the soundness of this criticism depends entirely on two things - first, the length of time- during which the stay in Egypt continued; and secondly, the sense in which the original number of the children of Israel in Egypt is said to have been "seventy souls." Now, as to the first point, there are two theories - one, basing itself on the Septuagint version of <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>, would make the duration of the Egyptian sojourn 215 years only; the other, following the clear <span class="accented">and repeated</span> statement of the Hebrew text (<a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40, 41</a>), literally rendered in our version, would extend the time to 430 years, or exactly double it. Much may be said on both sides of this question, and the best critics are divided with respect to it. The longer period is supported' by Kalisch, Kurtz, Knobel, Winer, Ewald, Delitzsch, and Canon Cook among moderns; by Koppe, Frank, Beer, Rosenmuller, Hofmann, Tiele, Reinke, Jahn, Vater, and J. D. Michaelis among earlier critics; the short period is approved by Calvin, Grotius, Buddeus, Morinus, Voss, Houbigant, Baumgarten; and among our own countrymen, by Ussher, Marsham, Geddes, and Kennicott. The point cannot be properly argued in an "exposition" like the present; but it may be remarked that both reason and authority are in favour of the simple acceptance of the words of the Hebrew text, which assign 430 years as the interval between Jacob's descent into Egypt and the deliverance under Moses. With respect to the number of those who accompanied Jacob into Egypt, and were assigned the land of Goshen for a habitation (<a href="/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>), it is important to bear in mind, first of all, that the "seventy souls" enumerated in <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-27</a> comprised only two females, and that "Jacob's sons' wives" are expressly mentioned as not included among them (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 26). If we add the wives of 67 males, we shall have, for the actual family of Jacob, 137 persons. Further, it is to be borne in mind that each Israelite family which went down into Egypt was accompanied by its "household" (<a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a>), consisting of at least some scores of dependants. If each son of Jacob had even 50 such retainers, and if Jacob himself had a household like that of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>), the entire number which "went down into Egypt" would have amounted to at least 2000 persons. According to Malthus, population tends to double itself, if there be no artificial check restraining it, every twenty-five years. At this rate, 2000 persons would expand into 2,048,000 in 250 years, 1000 would reach the same amount in 275 years, and 500 in 300 years; so that, even supposing the "seventy souls" with their "households" to have numbered no more than 500 persons when they went down into Egypt, the people would, unless artificially checked, have exceeded two millions at the expiration of three centuries - that is to say, 130 years before the Exodus! No doubt, the artificial checks which keep down the natural tendency of population to increase began to tell upon them considerably before that time. The "land of Goshen."a broad tract of very fertile country, became tolerably thickly peopled, and the rate of increase gradually subsided. Still, as the Delta was a space of from 7000 to 8000 square miles, and the land of Goshen was probably about half of it, a population of two millions is very much what we should expect, being at the rate of from 500 to 600 persons to the square mile. It is an interesting question whether the Egyptian remains <span class="accented">do</span>, or do not, contain any mention of the Hebrew sojourn; and if they do, whether any light is thereby thrown on these numbers. Now it is admitted on all hands that, about the time of the Hebrew sojourn, there was in Egypt a subject race, often employed in forced labours, called Aperu or Aperiu, and it seems impossible to deny that this word is a very fair Egyptian equivalent for the Biblical <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "Hebrews." We are forced, therefore, either to suppose that there were in Egypt, at one and the same time, two subject races with names almost identical, or to admit the identification of the Aperu with the descendants of Jacob. The exact numbers of the Aperu are nowhere mentioned; but it is a calculation of Dr. Brugsch that under Rameses II., a little before the Exodus, the foreign races in Egypt, of whom the Aperu were beyond all doubt the chief, "amounted certainly to a third, and probably still more," of the whole population ('History of Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 100, E.T.), which is usually reckoned at from 7,000,000 to 8,000,000, One-third of this number would be from 2,300,000 to 2,600,000. The writer of Exodus does not, however, as yet, make anything like a definite calculation. He is merely bent on having it understood that there had been a great multiplication, and that the "family" had grown into a "nation." To emphasise his statement, he uses four nearly synonymous verbs ("<span class="cmt_word">were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed-mighty"</span>), adding to the last a duplicated adverb, <span class="accented">bim'od m'od</span>, "much, much."
