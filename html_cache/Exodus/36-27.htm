The frames, or boards, were part of the tabernacle's structure, providing stability and form. The number six may symbolize human effort, as it is one less than seven, which often represents completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. The use of frames indicates a portable structure, suitable for the Israelites' nomadic lifestyle during their wilderness journey.<p><b>for the rear of the tabernacle</b><br>The rear of the tabernacle was the western side, which was considered the back. This orientation is significant because the entrance faced east, a direction often associated with the presence of God (as seen in the Garden of Eden and the direction of the rising sun). The rear would be the most protected part of the tabernacle, symbolizing the security and sanctity of God's dwelling place.<p><b>the west side</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, the west was often associated with the end of the day and rest. For the Israelites, the west side of the tabernacle would be the final point of their journey, symbolizing the ultimate rest and peace found in God's presence. The west side's construction with six frames highlights the importance of stability and protection for the most sacred area of the tabernacle, where the Holy of Holies was located. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who provides ultimate rest and security for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_west_side_of_the_tabernacle.htm">The West Side of the Tabernacle</a></b><br>The specific location mentioned in this verse, where six frames were constructed as part of the Tabernacle's structure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_detailed_instructions.htm">God's Detailed Instructions</a></b><br>The specific instructions for the Tabernacle's construction highlight God's attention to detail and His desire for order and beauty in worship.
