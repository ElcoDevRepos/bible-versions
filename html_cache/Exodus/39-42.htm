It reflects their commitment to follow God's instructions precisely. The work involved skilled craftsmanship and the use of materials contributed by the people, demonstrating a collective effort and unity among the Israelites. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, emphasizing the importance of following God's commands.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses.</b><br>This underscores the divine authority behind the instructions given to Moses. The phrase indicates that the work was not based on human ideas but was a direct fulfillment of God's specific commands. This obedience to divine instruction is a key aspect of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on obedience to Christ's teachings. The meticulous adherence to God's commands in the construction of the Tabernacle can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and tasked with building the Tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who provided the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law and instructions for the Tabernacle on Mount Sinai.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary constructed by the Israelites according to God's specifications, serving as a place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandments.htm">The Commandments</a></b><br>The specific instructions given by God to Moses regarding the construction and furnishing of the Tabernacle, which the Israelites followed meticulously.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' faithful execution of God's instructions serves as a model for believers to follow God's commands precisely and wholeheartedly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_details.htm">Faithfulness in Small Details</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites paid attention to every detail in the construction of the Tabernacle, believers are called to be faithful in the small details of their lives, knowing that God values obedience in all things.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_worship.htm">God's Presence and Worship</a></b><br>The completion of the Tabernacle was crucial for the Israelites to experience God's presence.

Scripture stresses completion: &#8220;So Moses finished the work&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-33.htm">Exodus 40:33</a>). Notice the tone:<p>&#8226; Thorough&#8212;nothing left half-done (compare <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>, &#8220;I have finished the race&#8221;).<p>&#8226; United&#8212;they labored &#8220;with one heart&#8221; (cf. <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Fruitful&#8212;good works prepared in advance (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>) actually got done.
