This change reflects the new Pharaoh's fear of the Israelites' growing population and potential power (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-10</a>). Taskmasters were likely Egyptian officials or overseers who enforced labor and maintained control over the Israelites, ensuring they remained subjugated. This oppression fulfills God's prophecy to Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved and mistreated in a foreign land for 400 years (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p><b>to oppress them with forced labor</b><br>The forced labor imposed on the Israelites was a means of control and suppression. It was intended to break their spirit and prevent them from becoming a threat to the Egyptians. This labor was harsh and relentless, as described later in <a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-14</a>, where the Israelites were forced to make bricks without straw. The oppression of the Israelites is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing the bondage of sin and the need for divine deliverance, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who frees humanity from spiritual slavery (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh</b><br>Pithom and Rameses were significant cities in ancient Egypt, serving as storage centers for grain and other goods. The construction of these cities by the Israelites underlines the scale of their forced labor and the wealth of the Egyptian empire. Archaeological evidence suggests that these cities were located in the eastern Nile Delta, a region known for its fertile land and strategic importance. The mention of Rameses connects to the biblical narrative of the Exodus, as it is also the starting point of the Israelites' journey out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The building of these cities can be seen as a type of Christ's work, where He prepares a place for His people (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>), contrasting the oppressive labor of the

The "task-masters" of the present passage are these high officials.<p><span class= "bld">To afflict them.</span>--This was the object of the whole proceeding. It was hoped that severe labour under the lash would produce so much suffering that the number of the Israelites would be thinned, and their multiplication stopped. Humanly speaking, the scheme was a "wise" one--i.e., one likely to be successful.<p><span class= "bld">They built for Pharaoh treasure-cities.</span>--By "treasure-cities" we are to understand "magazines"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>strongholds, where munitions of war could be laid up for use in case of an invasion. (In <a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm" title="And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.">1Kings 9:19</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.">2Chronicles 8:4</a>, the same expression is translated "cities of store.") The Pharaohs of the nineteenth dynasty gave great attention to the guarding of the north-eastern frontier in this way.<p><span class= "bld">Pithom.</span>--This city is reasonably identified with the "Patumus" of Herodotus (ii. 158), which was in Lower Egypt, not far from Bubastis (<span class= "ital">Tel Basta</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>It is mentioned in the inscriptions of the nineteenth dynasty under the name of Pi-Tum (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">History of Egypt, </span>vol. ii. p. 128). It was, as the name implies, a city of the sun-god, and was probably not very far from Heliopolis, the main seat of the sun-god's worship.<p><span class= "bld">Raamses.</span>--Pi-Ramesu, the city of Rameses, was the ordinary seat of the Court during the earlier part of the nineteenth dynasty. It appears to have been a new name for Tanis, or for a suburb of Tanis, which overshadowed the old city. Rameses II. claims to have built the greater part of it; but it was probably commenced by his father, Seti, who made the defence of the north-eastern frontier one of his main cares. The name must be considered as a mere variant rendering of the Egyptian Ramessu or Ramesu. The site is marked by the mounds at San.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They did set over them taskmasters</span>. Literally, "lords of tribute," or "lords of service." The term used, <span class="accented">sarey massim</span>, is the Egyptian official title for over-lookers of forced labour. It occurs in this sense on the monument representing brick-making, which has been supposed by some to be a picture of the Hebrews at work. (See Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. pt. 1. p. 253, and compare Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 376.) <span class="cmt_word">To afflict them with their burdens</span>. Among the tasks set the labourers in the representation above alluded to are the carrying of huge lumps of clay and of water-jars on one shoulder, and also the conveyance of bricks from place to place by means of a yoke<span class="cmt_word">. They built for Pharaoh treasure-cities</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Pithom and Raamses</span>. By "treasure-cities" we are to understand "store-cities," or "cities of store," as the same word is translated in <a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>. Such cities contained depots of provisions and magazines of arms. They were generally to be found on all assailable frontiers in ancient as in modern times. (Compare <a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5, 12</a>; 2 Chronicles 33:28, etc.) Of the cities here mentioned, which the Israelites are said to have "built," or helped to build, <span class="cmt_word">Pithom</span> is in all probability the Patumes of Herodotus (2:158), which was not far from Bubastis, now Tel-Basta. Its exact site is uncertain, but if identical with the Thou, or Thoum, of the ' Itinerary of An-tonine,' it must have lain north of the Canal of Necho, not south, where most maps place it. The word means "abode of the sun," or rather "of the setting sun," called by the Egyptians Tam, or Atum. Names formed on the model were very common under the nineteenth dynasty, Rameses II. having built a Pa-Ra, a Pa-Ammon, and a Pa-Phthah in Nubia (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. it. p. 90). Pa-Tum itself has not been found among the cities of this period (<span class="accented">ib.</span> p. 99), but appears in the records of the twentieth dynasty as a place where the Setting-Sun god had a treasury ('Records of the Past,' vol. 6. p. 54). The name Rameses is probably put for Pa-Rameses (as Thoum for Pa-Tum), a city frequently mentioned in the inscriptions of the nineteenth dynasty, and particularly favoured by Rameses II., whose city it was especially called ('Records of the Past,' vol. it. p. 77; vol. 6. p. 13), and by whom it was greatly enlarged, if not wholly built. We incline to believe that the building was commenced by Seti, who named the place, as he did his great temple, the Rameseum, after his father. The city was, according to Brugsch, a sort of suburb of Tanis ('History of Egypt,' vol. 2 p. 94). It was a magnificent place, and under Rameses II. and his son Menephthah was the ordinary residence of the court. Hence the miracles of Moses are said to have been wrought "in the field of Zoan," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. the country about Tanis (<a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12, 43</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [the Egyptians] appointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
