It underscores human fickleness and the tendency to stray from divine instructions. The context is the Israelites' impatience while Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the Law. This reflects a broader biblical theme of human disobedience and the need for steadfastness in faith, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/9-16.htm">Deuteronomy 9:16</a> and <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>. The phrase also serves as a warning against the dangers of spiritual complacency and the importance of adhering to God's path.<p><b>They have made for themselves a molten calf and have bowed down to it.</b><br>The creation of the molten calf represents a direct violation of the first two commandments given in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>, which prohibit idolatry. This act of making a physical idol was influenced by Egyptian religious practices, where animal deities were common. The calf, or young bull, was a symbol of strength and fertility in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This incident illustrates the Israelites' struggle to maintain monotheistic worship amidst surrounding polytheistic influences. It also foreshadows future instances of idolatry in Israel's history, such as in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a> with Jeroboam's golden calves.<p><b>They have sacrificed to it and said,</b><br>Sacrificing to the calf indicates a complete act of worship, showing the depth of their apostasy. Sacrifices were meant to be offerings to Yahweh, as outlined in Levitical law, but here they are misdirected. This act of sacrifice signifies a breach of covenant relationship with God, who had delivered them from Egypt. It also reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of God, who is spirit and not represented by physical forms. This misdirected worship is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, warning against the dangers of syncretism and the blending of true worship with pagan practices.<p><b>&#8216;These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a profound distortion of the truth, attributing the miraculous deliverance from Egypt to an idol. It echoes the words of Aaron in <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, showing a collective lapse in memory and faith. This statement is a direct affront to God's identity and power, as He alone is the deliverer of Israel. The plural "gods" may reflect the influence of polytheistic beliefs, despite the singular act of deliverance by Yahweh. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the ease with which people can be led astray and the importance of remembering and honoring God's past acts of salvation, as emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the high priest, who played a crucial role in the creation of the golden calf.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt, now in the wilderness, and struggling with faithfulness to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_calf.htm">The Golden Calf</a></b><br>An idol made by the Israelites in Moses' absence, representing a significant act of disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_impatience.htm">The Danger of Impatience</a></b><br>The Israelites' impatience led them to idolatry.

The verse warns every generation that hearts can cool rapidly, that idols are handcrafted long before they are cast in metal, and that only the LORD deserves worship for His saving acts. Vigilant obedience keeps us from repeating Israel&#8217;s tragic exchange of the living God for the dead works of our own hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">These be thy gods.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">This is thy god, </span>as in <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm" title="And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have turned aside quickly</span>.

A molten calf. In the contemptuous language of Holy Scripture when speaking of idols, such an emblematic figure as the Babylonion man-bull would be a mere "calf." That the figure made by Aaron is called always "a molten calf" - literally, "a calf of fusion" - disposes of the theory of Keil, that it was of carved wood covered with gold plates hammered on to it. <span class="cmt_word">These be thy gods,</span> <span class="cmt_word">which have brought thee.</span> Rather, "This is thy god, which has brought thee."
