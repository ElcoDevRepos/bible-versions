In the context of <a href="/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a>, Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, is speaking. Jethro, a Midianite priest, is respected for his wisdom and experience. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wise counsel, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the importance of guidance.<p><b>I will give you some advice,</b><br>Jethro offers practical counsel to Moses, highlighting the biblical theme of mentorship and the value of experienced guidance. This is reminiscent of the advice given by elders throughout Scripture, such as the counsel of Ahithophel in <a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>, which was highly regarded.<p><b>and may God be with you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief that true wisdom and successful leadership are dependent on God's presence and blessing. It echoes the biblical theme of divine guidance, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God promises to be with Joshua as he leads Israel.<p><b>You must be the people&#8217;s representative before God</b><br>Moses is called to act as an intermediary between God and the Israelites, a role that foreshadows the mediatory work of Jesus Christ, who is described as the one mediator between God and humanity in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. This also reflects the priestly function later formalized in the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>and bring their causes to Him.</b><br>Moses is tasked with presenting the people's issues and disputes to God, highlighting the importance of intercessory prayer and advocacy. This anticipates the role of Christ as our advocate with the Father, as mentioned in 1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>.

Good advice aligns with God&#8217;s revealed will, never replacing it.
