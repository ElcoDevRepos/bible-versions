The central opening signifies the importance of the garment's function, allowing it to be worn over the head, symbolizing the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people. The centrality of the opening may also reflect the central role of the priesthood in Israel's worship and covenant relationship with God. This design is practical, ensuring the garment can be worn securely and comfortably during priestly duties.<p><b>Around the opening shall be a woven collar</b><br>The woven collar around the opening serves both a functional and symbolic purpose. Functionally, it reinforces the garment, preventing wear and tear, which is crucial for a garment meant to be used repeatedly in sacred rituals. Symbolically, the collar represents the strength and integrity required of the priestly office. The craftsmanship involved in weaving the collar reflects the care and precision required in serving God, paralleling the meticulous nature of the Law given to Israel.<p><b>with an opening like that of a garment</b><br>This comparison to a common garment suggests that while the ephod is a sacred item, it is also practical and functional. The design is intentional, ensuring that the ephod is durable and fit for the high priest's active role. This phrase may also imply that the sacred and the ordinary are interconnected, as the priestly garments, though unique, share similarities with everyday clothing, reminding the priest of his humanity and the need for humility before God.<p><b>so that it will not tear</b><br>The instruction to prevent tearing underscores the importance of maintaining the garment's integrity. In biblical symbolism, tearing can represent division or destruction, as seen in the tearing of the temple veil at Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), which signified the end of the separation between God and humanity. For the high priest's garment, preventing tears ensures that the priest remains whole and unblemished in his service, reflecting the holiness and perfection required in approaching God. This also prefigures the unblemished nature of Christ, our High Priest, who mediates the new covenant without flaw or imperfection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, who was appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
