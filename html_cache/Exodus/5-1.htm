This encounter marks the beginning of a series of confrontations between God's representatives and the Egyptian authority. The phrase "went to Pharaoh" indicates a direct approach, signifying the boldness and obedience of Moses and Aaron in fulfilling God's command. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine figures in Egyptian culture, making this confrontation not just political but also spiritual.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenant name of God, highlighting His eternal and unchanging nature. By identifying God as "the God of Israel," Moses and Aaron assert the distinct identity and divine backing of the Israelites. This declaration sets the stage for the ensuing conflict between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt, showcasing the supremacy of YHWH.<p><b>&#8216;Let My people go,</b><br>This command is a direct challenge to Pharaoh's authority, as the Israelites were considered his slaves. The phrase "My people" underscores God's ownership and covenant relationship with Israel.

The wilderness represents a place of separation from Egypt, symbolizing a break from idolatry and a return to true worship. This foreshadows the eventual exodus and the establishment of Israel as a nation dedicated to God.

The Israelites could not offer their proper sacrificial animals in the presence of the Egyptians without the risk of provoking a burst of religious animosity, since among the animals would necessarily be some which all, or many, of the Egyptians regarded as sacred, and under no circumstances to be killed. The fanaticism of the Egyptians on such occasions led to wars, tumults, and massacres. (See Plutarch, 'De Isid. et Osir.,' &sect; 44.)
