The act of cutting the ram into pieces symbolizes the thoroughness and completeness required in the sacrificial system. It reflects the seriousness of sin and the need for a complete offering to God. This practice is consistent with other sacrificial rituals in the Old Testament, such as those found in <a href="/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6</a>, where the burnt offering is also cut into pieces. The division of the animal can be seen as a type of Christ, whose body was broken for the sins of humanity, fulfilling the sacrificial system once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>Wash the entrails and legs</b><br>Washing the entrails and legs signifies purification and cleanliness, which are essential themes in the Levitical laws. The entrails and legs, being parts of the animal that come into contact with impurities, needed to be cleansed before being offered to God. This act of washing can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual cleansing, emphasizing the need for purity in worship and service to God. In the New Testament, this concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>, where Jesus speaks of the need for His disciples to be spiritually clean.<p><b>And place them with its head and other pieces</b><br>The placement of the washed parts with the head and other pieces indicates the reassembly of the animal on the altar, symbolizing unity and completeness in the offering. This act ensures that the entire animal is presented to God, signifying total dedication and surrender. The head, representing leadership and authority, is placed with the other parts, highlighting the importance of offering every aspect of one's life to God. This comprehensive offering prefigures the total sacrifice of Christ, who gave Himself wholly for the redemption of humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is receiving instructions from God on how to consecrate Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and his sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, who are being consecrated for their service in the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram.htm">The Ram</a></b><br>A sacrificial animal used in the consecration ceremony, symbolizing dedication and atonement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the consecration ceremony takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine authority giving detailed instructions for worship and consecration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_preparation.htm">Holiness and Preparation</a></b><br>The washing of the entrails and legs signifies the importance of purity and preparation in approaching God.
