The hailstorm was a demonstration of God's power and judgment against the Egyptians and their gods. The exemption of Goshen underscores God's ability to distinguish between His people and their oppressors. This selective protection is reminiscent of the Passover, where the Israelites were spared from the final plague. It also foreshadows the concept of divine protection seen in <a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>, where a thousand may fall at one's side, but it will not come near those under God's care.<p><b>was in the land of Goshen</b><br>Goshen was a region in Egypt where the Israelites settled during Joseph's time (<a href="/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>). It was likely located in the eastern part of the Nile Delta, a fertile area suitable for grazing and agriculture. The land of Goshen served as a place of refuge and provision for the Israelites during their time in Egypt. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic peoples, like the Israelites, lived in this region during the period of the Exodus. Goshen's separation from the rest of Egypt symbolizes the distinct identity and destiny of the Israelites as God's chosen people.<p><b>where the Israelites lived</b><br>The Israelites, descendants of Jacob, had been living in Egypt for several generations by the time of the Exodus. Their presence in Goshen was initially a result of Joseph's high position in Pharaoh's court, which allowed his family to settle in Egypt during a time of famine. Over time, the Israelites grew in number and strength, which led to their enslavement by a new Pharaoh who did not know Joseph (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-10</a>). The distinction of their dwelling place during the plagues serves as a testament to God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ensuring the preservation and eventual deliverance of their descendants. This protection is a type of Christ, who provides spiritual refuge and salvation for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who was chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, living in the land of Goshen during their time in Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/goshen.htm">Goshen</a></b><br>A region in Egypt where the Israelites resided, which was spared from the plague of hail.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_hail.htm">The Plague of Hail</a></b><br>One of the ten plagues that God sent upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God demonstrates His power and control over nature and nations.
