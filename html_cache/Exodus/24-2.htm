In the context of the covenant at Mount Sinai, Moses is chosen to represent the people before God, emphasizing his leadership and prophetic role. This exclusivity underscores the holiness of God and the need for a mediator, a theme that is echoed throughout the Bible. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), fulfilling the typology of Moses as the one who intercedes on behalf of the people.<p><b>but the others must not come near</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the separation between the holy and the common. The "others" likely refer to Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders mentioned earlier in the chapter. Their inability to approach signifies the holiness of God and the need for reverence and obedience to His commands. This separation is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where access to God's presence is restricted to those He specifically calls. It foreshadows the New Covenant, where through Christ's sacrifice, believers are granted direct access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>And the people may not go up with him.&#8221;</b><br>The restriction placed on the general populace from ascending the mountain underscores the gravity and sanctity of the divine encounter. It serves as a reminder of the Israelites' need for purification and preparation before approaching God. This separation also highlights the concept of holiness and the need for a mediator, which is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ. The mountain itself, often identified with Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula, becomes a symbol of divine revelation and covenant, a place where heaven and earth meet. The people's exclusion from the mountain reinforces the idea of God's transcendence and the necessity of His chosen mediator to bridge the gap between the divine and human realms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is chosen by God to approach Him directly.
