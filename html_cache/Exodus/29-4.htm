This presentation signifies their official appointment to the priesthood. The priesthood of Aaron is a type of Christ's eternal priesthood, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>, where Christ is called by God to be a high priest. The selection of Aaron and his sons also emphasizes the importance of lineage and divine calling in the Old Testament priesthood.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It symbolized God's presence among His people. The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a significant location, as it was where God communicated with Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>). This setting underscores the sacredness of the ordination process and the need for the priests to be ceremonially clean before entering God's presence.<p><b>and wash them with water</b><br>The washing with water represents purification and the removal of impurity, a necessary step before serving in the holy duties of the priesthood. This act of washing is a precursor to the New Testament concept of baptism, which symbolizes spiritual cleansing and rebirth (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The ritual washing also points to the need for holiness and purity in those who serve God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, which speaks of having clean hands and a pure heart to stand in God's holy place.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

Rabbinical tradition says that it was not placed exactly opposite the door, but a little towards the south side of the court.<p><span class= "bld">And shalt wash them.</span>--This is the first mention in Scripture of a religious ablution. Water is so natural a symbol of purity, and ablution so apt a representative of the purging from sin, that we can feel surprise neither at the widespread use of the symbolism in religions of very different characters, nor at its adoption into the system at this time imposed by Divine Providence upon the Hebrews. As it was to maintain its place even in the Divinely-appointed ceremonial of Christianity, it must have been <span class= "ital">a fortiori </span>suitable for the earlier and less spiritual dispensation. The widespread employment of it in other religions--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in Egypt (Herod. ii. 37); in Persia (<span class= "ital">Zendavesta, </span>8 p. 271. Spiegel's translation); in Greece (D&#8221;llinger, <span class= "ital">Jew and Gentile, </span>vol. i., p. 220); in Italy (<span class= "ital">Dict. of Greek and Rom. Antiq., </span>p. 719), and elsewhere--was no argument against its adoption into the Mosaic ceremonial, since the Divine legislation of Sinai was not intended to annul or supersede natural religion, but only to improve and expand it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">The Ablution</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the door of the tabernacle.</span> The great laver was to be placed between the entrance to the tabernacle and the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>). It was to this probably that Aaron and his sons were to be brought. Its main purpose was to be a lustral vessel, placed ready for the various ablutions which the law required (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 19-21). <span class="cmt_word">Thou .... shalt wash them with water.</span> Ablutions were an important part of the ceremonial of almost all ancient religions. In Egypt, the priests were compelled to wash themselves from head to foot in cold water twice every day, and twice every night (Herod. 2:37). In the religion of Zoroaster frequent washing with water was prescribed for many kinds of impurity (Zendavesta, 8. p. 271, et seq.). The Greeks were particularly addicted to ceremonies of which ablution formed a part; and it is to Rome that we are indebted both for the word and for the idea of "lustration." It is a true instinct which has taught men the analogy between physical and moral purity, and led them to typify the removal of spiritual, by the cleansing from physical, defilement. The religion given at Sinai set a stamp of approval in many points on what may be called "the religion of nature;" and among them on this. Ablutions were required of the priests, not only at consecration, but every time that they entered the tabernacle, or sacrificed on the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>). Washing was a main feature in the cleansing of leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/13-54.htm">Leviticus 13:54, 58</a>) and of the leper. (<a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>). It was also employed for the purification of many minor defilements (<a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm">Leviticus 11:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, etc.). At what date it first came into use in the admission of proselytes is uncertain. Whether the washing of consecration extended to the whole body, or was limited to the hands and feet, is also a point on which critics have disagreed, but one of no great importance.
