It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament, signifying that the message is not from a human source but from God Himself. This underscores the importance and certainty of the forthcoming action.<p><b>By this you will know that I am the LORD:</b><br>The purpose of the miracle is to reveal God's identity and power. In the context of the plagues, it serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian pantheon, particularly the gods associated with the Nile. This phrase highlights God's desire for recognition and acknowledgment from both the Israelites and Egyptians. It echoes the theme of divine self-revelation found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a> and <a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37</a>.<p><b>Behold, with the staff in my hand:</b><br>The staff is a symbol of authority and divine power. Moses' staff, used in various miracles, represents God's intervention in human affairs. The staff's use here connects to earlier biblical narratives, such as Moses' encounter with God at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>), where the staff was first transformed into a serpent. It prefigures the authority of Christ, who performs miracles by divine power.<p><b>I will strike the water of the Nile:</b><br>The Nile River was the lifeblood of Egypt, central to its agriculture, economy, and religion. Striking the Nile symbolizes a direct assault on the heart of Egyptian life and their deities, such as Hapi, the god of the Nile. This act demonstrates God's supremacy over creation and false gods, similar to Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.<p><b>and it will turn to blood:</b><br>The transformation of water into blood is a miraculous sign of judgment. It foreshadows the first plague and serves as a precursor to the ultimate judgment on Egypt. This act of turning water into blood is reminiscent of the blood of Christ, which signifies both judgment and redemption. The imagery of blood is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing life, covenant, and atonement, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over creation and the gods of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

God here speaks of the acts of Moses and Aaron as his own acts, and of their hands as his hand, because they were mere instruments through which he worked. The Roman law said: "Qui facit per alium, tacit per se." <span class="cmt_word">The waters... shall be turned to blood</span>. Not simply, "shall be of the colour of blood," as Rosenmuller paraphrases, but shall become and be, to all intents and purposes, blood. It is idle to ask whether the water would have answered to all the modern tests, microscopic and other, by which blood is known. The question cannot be answered. An that we are entitled to conclude from the words of the text is, that the water had all the physical appearance the look, taste, smell, texture of blood: and hence, that it was certainly not merely discoloured by the red soil of Abyssinia, nor by cryptegamic plants and infusoria. Water thus changed would neither kill fish, nor "stink," nor be utterly undrinkable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">By this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1494;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you will know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1491;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">am the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
