In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the east was often associated with new beginnings and life, as it is the direction from which the sun rises. Biblically, the east is also significant as the direction from which God's glory enters the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>). The entrance to the Garden of Eden was on the east (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), and the Israelites would have seen the east as a direction of hope and divine presence.<p><b>toward the sunrise</b><br>The mention of the sunrise emphasizes the importance of light and new beginnings. In Scripture, light often symbolizes God's presence and truth (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The orientation of the tabernacle toward the sunrise could symbolize the Israelites' orientation toward God and His guidance. It also reflects the natural order and rhythm established by God, aligning worship with the daily cycle of creation.<p><b>is to be fifty cubits wide</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, fifty cubits would be about 75 feet or 22.5 meters. The specific dimensions of the tabernacle and its courtyard were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>), emphasizing the importance of divine order and precision in worship. The size of the courtyard allowed for the gathering of the Israelites for worship and sacrifice, symbolizing the community's collective approach to God. The number fifty can also be significant in biblical numerology, often associated with jubilee and freedom (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), hinting at the liberation and redemption found in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the courtyard was a significant part.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The outer area surrounding the Tabernacle, where the altar of burnt offering and the bronze basin were located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_side.htm">East Side</a></b><br>The direction specified for the entrance of the courtyard, symbolizing new beginnings and the presence of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were to construct and worship at the Tabernacle according to God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_east.htm">Symbolism of the East</a></b><br>The east side of the Tabernacle courtyard represents new beginnings and the hope of God's presence.

The eastward entrance welcomes worshippers into His light, the sunrise anchors every sacrifice in fresh grace, and the measured width signals both precision and generous access. All of it foreshadows Christ, the true Sunrise, whose open, exact way leads every believer into the presence of the Holy One.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">On the east side eastward.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in front, towards the east. </span>Both the tabernacle and the Temple faced to the east, which was regarded as "the front of the world" by the Orientals generally.

It was, however, a belief quite separate from sun-worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breadth of the court on the east side eastward</span>. Rather, "in front toward the east." The Rabbinical tradition was that Adam found himself on his creation fronting towards the east, and had consequently the south on his right, the north on his left, and the west behind him.
