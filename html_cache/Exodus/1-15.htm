Historically, this period is often associated with the New Kingdom of Egypt, possibly during the reign of a Pharaoh from the 18th or 19th Dynasty. The king's authority is absolute in Egypt, reflecting the centralized power and control he wielded over the nation. This sets the stage for the oppressive measures he would take against the Israelites, highlighting the tension between the Egyptians and the Hebrews.<p><b>to the Hebrew midwives</b><br>The mention of Hebrew midwives indicates the presence of a distinct and growing Hebrew population in Egypt. Midwives played a crucial role in ancient societies, assisting in childbirth and ensuring the survival of both mother and child. The fact that these midwives are specifically identified as Hebrew suggests their integral role within the Hebrew community. This also underscores the Pharaoh's attempt to directly influence the Hebrew population through those who had significant influence over life and death at birth.<p><b>whose names were Shiphrah and Puah</b><br>Naming the midwives Shiphrah and Puah is significant, as it personalizes the narrative and highlights their courage and faith. In a patriarchal society, the mention of these women by name is notable and suggests their importance in the unfolding story of Israel's deliverance. Their actions are a precursor to the theme of God using unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes. The names themselves, Shiphrah meaning "beauty" or "brightness" and Puah possibly meaning "splendid" or "fragrant," may reflect their character or the esteem in which they were held. Their defiance of the king's orders is a testament to their fear of God over man, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, where Peter and the apostles declare, "We must obey God rather than men."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_egypt.htm">King of Egypt (Pharaoh)</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who felt threatened by the growing population of the Israelites and sought to suppress them through oppressive measures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_midwives.htm">Hebrew Midwives (Shiphrah and Puah)</a></b><br>Two women tasked by Pharaoh to kill Hebrew male infants at birth.

God&#8217;s Word thus exalts quiet obedience above earthly power and prepares us to witness His saving intervention.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The Hebrew midwives.</span>--Or <span class= "ital">the midwives of the Hebrew women </span>(<span class= "greekheb">???? ?????? ??? ???????</span>, LXX.). The Hebrew construction admits of either rendering. In favour of the midwives being Egyptians is the consideration that the Pharaoh would scarcely have expected Hebrew women to help him in the extirpation of the Hebrew race (Kalisch); against it is the Semitic character of the names--Shiphrah, "beautiful;" Puah, "one who cries out;" and also the likelihood that a numerous and peculiar people, like the Hebrews, would have accoucheurs of their own race.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> - some time - say five or six years - having elapsed and the Pharaoh's first plan having manifestly failed, it was necessary for him either to give up his purpose, or to devise something else. Persevering and tenacious, he preferred the latter course. He bethought himself that a stop might be put to the multiplication of the Israelites by means of infanticide on a large scale. Infanticide was no doubt a crime in Egypt, as in most countries except Rome; but the royal command would legitimate almost any action, since the king was recognised as a god; and the wrongs of a foreign and subject race would not sensibly move the Egyptian people, or be likely to provoke remonstrance. On looking about for suitable instruments to carry out his design, it struck the monarch that something, at any rate, might be done by means of the midwives who attended the Hebrew women in their confinements. It has been supposed that the two mentioned, Shiphrah and Puah, might be the only midwives employed by the Israelites (Canon Cook and others), and no doubt in the East a small number suffice for a large population: but what impression could the monarch expect to make on a population of from one to two millions of souls by engaging the services of two persons only, who could not possibly attend more than about one in fifty of the births? The midwives mentioned must therefore be regarded as "superintendents," chiefs of the guild or faculty, who were expected to give their orders to the rest. (So Kalisch, Knobel, Aben Ezra, etc.) It was no doubt well known that midwives were not always called in; but the king supposed that they were employed sufficiently often for the execution of his orders to produce an important result. And the narrative implies that he had not miscalculated. It was the disobedience of the midwives (ver. 17) that frustrated the king's intention, not any inherent weakness in his plan. The midwives, while professing the intention of carrying out the orders given them, in reality killed none of the infants; and, when taxed by the Pharaoh with disobedience, made an untrue excuse (ver. 19). Thus the king's second plan failed as completely as his first - "the people" still "multiplied and waxed very mighty" (ver. 20). Foiled a second time, the wicked king threw off all reserve and all attempt at concealment. If the midwives will not stain their hands with murder at his secret command, he will make the order a general and public one. "All his people" shall be commanded to put their hand to the business, and to assist in the massacre of the innocents - it shall he the duty of every loyal subject to cast into the waters of the Nile any Hebrew male child of whose birth he has cognisance. The object is a national one-to secure the public safety (see ver. 10): the whole nation may well be called upon to aid in carrying it out. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Hebrew midwives</span>. It is questioned whether the midwives were really Hebrew women, and not rather Egyptian women, whose special business it was to attend the Hebrew women in their labours. Kalisch translates, "the women who served as midwives to the Hebrews," and assumes that they were Egyptians. (So also Canon Cook.) But the names are apparently Semitic, Shiphrah being "elegant, beautiful," and Puah, "one who cries out." And the most natural rendering of the Hebrew text is that of A. V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
