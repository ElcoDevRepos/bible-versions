Lodging places were common rest stops for travelers in the ancient Near East, often near water sources or trade routes. This setting emphasizes the transitional nature of Moses' mission and the urgency of his return to Egypt to lead the Israelites out of bondage.<p><b>the LORD met Moses</b><br>The encounter with the LORD (Yahweh) is significant, as it underscores the direct and personal nature of God's relationship with Moses. This meeting is unexpected and highlights the seriousness of the situation. In the broader biblical narrative, God often meets individuals at critical junctures in their lives, such as Jacob at Peniel (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>) and Joshua near Jericho (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>).<p><b>and was about to kill him</b><br>This phrase is startling and suggests a grave offense on Moses' part. The context implies that Moses had neglected the covenantal sign of circumcision for his son, which was a critical requirement for the descendants of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). The severity of the LORD's response underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the covenant. This incident foreshadows the seriousness of covenantal faithfulness, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. It also prefigures the necessity of atonement and the seriousness of sin, which are ultimately fulfilled in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is on his way back to Egypt after being commissioned by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery.

But the existing Hebrew text is probably correct. God met Moses, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> visited him with a sharp attack of illness, which threatened to be fatal. Both he and his wife seem at once to have concluded that the visitation was a punishment, on account of their having neglected to circumcise their new-born son. Perhaps Moses had an intimation from God to that effect.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - The transition is abrupt from the promise of triumph over Pharaoh to the threat of instant death. But we must bear in mind that some days may have elapsed between the two, and that the sin which provoked the menace was probably not committed at the date of the promise. The narrative of verses 24-26 is obscure from its brevity; but the most probable explanation of the circumstances is, that Zipporah had been delivered of her second son, Eliezer, some few days before she set out on the journey to Egypt. Childbirth, it must be remembered, in the East does not incapacitate a person from exertion for more than a day or two. On the journey, the eighth day from the birth of the child arrived, and his circumcision ought to have taken place; but Zipporah had a repugnance to the rite, and deferred it, Moses weakly consenting to the illegality. At the close of the eighth day, when Moses went to rest for the night, he was seized with a sudden and dangerous illness, which he regarded, and rightly regarded, as a God-inflicted punishment, sent to chastise his sin in breaking the Divine command (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-12</a>). Zipporah understood the matter in the same way; and, as her husband was too ill to perform the rite, she herself with her own hand cut off her boy's foreskin, and, still indignant at what she had been forced to do, cast it at her husband's feet, with the reproach - "Surely a bloody husband art thou to me." The rite once performed, however reluctantly, God remitted his anger, and. allowed Moses to recover his health, and pursue his journey. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass by the way in the inn</span>. "Inns," in our sense of the word, were unknown in the East for many ages after the time of Moses, and are still of very rare occurrence. Khans or caravanserais take their place. These are unfurnished buildings, open to all travellers, who thus obtain shelter <span class="accented">gratis?</span> but must provide themselves with food, bedding, and all other necessaries. It is questioned, however, if even such a place as this is here meant. Probably, the <span class="accented">malon</span> of Moses' time was a mere recognised halting-place, in the vicinity of a well, at which travellers were accustomed to pass the night. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord met him and sought to kill him</span>. A sudden seizure, followed by a dangerous illness, is generally thought to he intended (Knobel, Kalisch, Rosenmuller, Canon Cook); but the words seem more appropriate to a miraculous appearance, like that of the angel to Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>). Still, it is quite possible that nothing more than an illness is meant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now at a lodging place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4411.htm">Strong's 4411: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lodgment, caravanserai, encampment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along the way,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;ad&#183;de&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">confronted [Moses]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6298.htm">Strong's 6298: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in contact with, to concur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and was about</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;q&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to kill him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;m&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/4-24.htm">OT Law: Exodus 4:24 It happened on the way at (Exo.
