This daily routine reflects the importance of consistent spiritual discipline and dependence on God. It parallels the Lord's Prayer, "Give us this day our daily bread," highlighting daily reliance on God for sustenance.<p><b>each one gathered as much as was needed</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of sufficiency and contentment. Each person gathered according to their need, illustrating God's provision for all. It reflects the New Testament teaching in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-15.htm">2 Corinthians 8:15</a>, where Paul references this event to encourage equality and sharing among believers.<p><b>and when the sun grew hot</b><br>The timing of gathering manna was crucial, as it had to be collected before the sun's heat caused it to melt. This detail emphasizes the importance of obedience and diligence in following God's instructions. It also serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of earthly provisions and the need to prioritize spiritual matters.<p><b>it melted away</b><br>The melting of manna symbolizes the temporary nature of earthly sustenance and the need for timely obedience. It also foreshadows the impermanence of worldly things compared to the eternal nature of God's word and promises.
