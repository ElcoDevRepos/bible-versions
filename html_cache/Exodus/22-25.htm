Lending to the poor reflects God's concern for social justice and care for the needy. The Israelites were a covenant community, and this command underscores the importance of mutual support. The poor were often vulnerable, and God's law provided protection for them. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to care for one another (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><b>you must not act as a creditor to him</b><br>In ancient times, creditors had significant power over debtors, often leading to exploitation. This command restricts the lender's power, ensuring that the relationship remains one of compassion rather than oppression. The term "creditor" implies a formal, business-like transaction, which is not the intended relationship among God's people. This reflects God's character, who is merciful and just, and calls His people to emulate these attributes.<p><b>you are not to charge him interest</b><br>Charging interest, or usury, was prohibited in lending to fellow Israelites, as it could lead to further impoverishment of the poor. This law aimed to prevent the rich from exploiting the poor, promoting economic equality and community solidarity. The prohibition of interest is also seen in <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>, reinforcing its importance.

It was absolutely forbidden to exact any interest from those borrowers who were Israelites. The wording of the present passage, and of some others (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm" title="And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you.">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>), construed strictly, prohibits interest only on loans to the poor; but, as in a primitive state of society only the poor wish to borrow, the qualifying expression lost its force, and to exact any interest of any Israelite was regarded as wrong. (See <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm" title="He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm" title="He that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.">Proverbs 28:8</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-7.htm" title="Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.">Nehemiah 5:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm" title="Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.">Nehemiah 5:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-13.htm" title="Has given forth on usury, and has taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.">Ezekiel 18:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-12.htm" title="In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken usury and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 22:12</a>.) And some prohibitions, as <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>, were expressed in the most general terms. On the other hand, the lending of money upon interest to foreigners was distinctly allowed (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm" title="To a stranger you may lend on usury; but to your brother you shall not lend on usury: that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set your hand to in the land where you go to possess it.">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>), and no limit placed upon the amount of interest that might be taken. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The law of lending money and borrowing</span>. It is peculiar to the Jewish law to forbid the lending of money at interest by citizen to citizen. In the present passage, and in some others (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>), it might seem that interest was only forbidden in the case of a loan to one who was poor; but the general execration of usury (<a href="/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>), and the description of the righteous man as "he that hath not given his money upon usury" (<a href="/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), seem rather to imply that the practice, so far as Israelites were concerned, was forbidden altogether. On the other hand, it was distinctly declared (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>) that interest might be taken from strangers. There does not seem to have been any rate of interest which was regarded as excessive, and "usurious," in the modern sense.
