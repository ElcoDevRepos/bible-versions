Tenons are a type of joint used in woodworking, indicating the importance of stability and durability in the tabernacle's design. This method ensured that the frames were securely joined, symbolizing unity and strength. The tabernacle, as a dwelling place for God's presence among the Israelites, required meticulous attention to detail, reflecting God's holiness and the need for order in worship. The concept of two becoming one can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the unity between Christ and the Church, as well as the unity within the body of believers.<p><b>He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.</b><br>The consistency in the construction of all the frames highlights the uniformity and orderliness that God commanded for His dwelling place. This uniformity can be seen as a reflection of God's unchanging nature and the consistency of His laws and commandments. The tabernacle served as a portable sanctuary during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, and its construction was a communal effort, involving the skills and contributions of many. This mirrors the New Testament teaching of the Church as the body of Christ, where each member has a role and function, contributing to the whole. The tabernacle's design and construction were divinely inspired, as detailed in earlier chapters of Exodus, emphasizing the importance of following God's instructions precisely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for building the tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites traveled and where the tabernacle was constructed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_connection.htm">Unity and Connection</a></b><br>The two tenons connected to one another symbolize unity and strength.

The same theme recurs when the Apostle Paul calls believers &#8220;God&#8217;s building&#8221; and insists that &#8220;each one must be careful how he builds&#8221; (1 <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>- Just as the tenons anchored every board, so Christ anchors His people: &#8220;The firm foundation of God stands&#8221; (2 <a href="/titus/2-1.htm">Titus 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to each other for each frame</b><p>- The two tenons on every board were &#8220;connected to one another,&#8221; highlighting perfect alignment. No frame was allowed to jut out or stand aloof.<p>- Together they formed a seamless wall, prefiguring the unity of the redeemed: &#8220;we, though many, are one body in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>) and are &#8220;fitted together&#8221; into a holy temple (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>).<p>- Because every frame shared the same design, no single piece drew attention to itself. Likewise, mature believers &#8220;do nothing out of selfish ambition&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>) but serve in harmony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way</b><p>- Moses&#8217; craftsmen did not improvise; they followed the heavenly pattern shown on the mountain (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9, 40</a>). Uniform obedience produced a structure worthy of God&#8217;s glory.<p>- The repetition&#8212;&#8220;all the frames&#8230; in this way&#8221;&#8212;underscores consistency. God&#8217;s people today are to build with the same consistency: &#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order&#8221; (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 14</a>:40).<p>- Every board, every socket, every tenon testified to the faithfulness of the workers and, above all, to the faithfulness of the God who gave the blueprint (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/36-22.htm">Exodus 36:22</a> records more than carpentry; it reveals God&#8217;s insistence on a stable, unified, and consistently constructed dwelling. Two matching tenons secured each frame, portraying the firmness that Christ provides. Their perfect alignment prefigured the unity of His people. And the fact that every board was made &#8220;in this way&#8221; shows that God&#8217;s work must follow God&#8217;s pattern.
