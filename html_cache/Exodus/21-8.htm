The term "displeasing" suggests that the master found some fault or reason not to fulfill this intention. This reflects the patriarchal society of the time, where women often had limited rights and were subject to the decisions of male authority figures. The designation for himself implies a betrothal-like arrangement, highlighting the seriousness of the commitment.<p><b>he must allow her to be redeemed</b><br>The concept of redemption here is significant, as it provides a means for the woman to regain her freedom or be transferred to another household. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption, where God provides a way for His people to be delivered from bondage. The provision for redemption underscores the value placed on human dignity and the protection of individuals from exploitation.<p><b>He has no right to sell her to foreigners</b><br>This restriction emphasizes the importance of keeping the covenant community intact and protecting its members from being sold into potentially harsher conditions outside of Israel. It reflects the broader biblical principle of caring for the vulnerable and maintaining the integrity of the community. The prohibition against selling to foreigners also aligns with the laws given to Israel to remain distinct from surrounding nations.<p><b>since he has broken faith with her</b><br>Breaking faith indicates a breach of trust or covenant, which is a serious matter in biblical terms. This phrase suggests that the master has failed to honor his commitment, which is a violation of the ethical and moral standards expected within the community. This concept of faithfulness is echoed throughout Scripture, where God is portrayed as the ultimate example of faithfulness, and His people are called to reflect that character in their relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant_girl.htm">Hebrew Servant Girl</a></b><br>The subject of the verse, a young woman sold into servitude, often due to poverty or debt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The man who has taken the servant girl with the intention of making her his wife or concubine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>The process by which the servant girl can be bought back or freed, typically by her family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites to whom the servant girl cannot be sold, emphasizing the protection of her rights within the covenant community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_community.htm">Covenant Community</a></b><br>The broader context of Israelite society, governed by laws given by God to Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_human_dignity.htm">Value of Human Dignity</a></b><br>This verse underscores the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their social status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_relationships.htm">Faithfulness in Relationships</a></b><br>The master's obligation not to sell the servant girl to foreigners reflects the importance of faithfulness and integrity in all relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_and_restoration.htm">Redemption and Restoration</a></b><br>The provision for redemption highlights God's desire for restoration and freedom, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_of_the_vulnerable.htm">Protection of the Vulnerable</a></b><br>The law protects the servant girl from being exploited, reminding us of our responsibility to protect and advocate for the vulnerable in society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The role of the community in the redemption process emphasizes the importance of communal support and accountability.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_21_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 21:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_8_Justice_in_servitude.htm">How does Exodus 21:8 reflect God's concern for justice in servitude?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Human_ties_vs_divine_standards.htm">What does "not please her master" reveal about human relationships and God's standards?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_8_Fairness_in_treatment.htm">How can Exodus 21:8 guide us in treating others with fairness today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_21_8_to_NT_love_justice.htm">Connect Exodus 21:8 with New Testament teachings on love and justice.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_8_in_today_s_work_ethics.htm">How can we apply the principles of Exodus 21:8 in modern employment practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_8_vs_modern_human_rights.htm">How does Exodus 21:8 align with modern views on human rights and slavery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_allow_selling_a_female_servant.htm">Why does Exodus 21:8 permit selling a female servant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_explains_Exodus_21_8_laws.htm">What historical context explains the laws in Exodus 21:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_is_a_true_neighbor_to_the_needy.htm">Who truly acts as a neighbor to those in need?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_should_foreigners_be_treated_biblically.htm">What does the Bible say about treating foreigners?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_exodus_21_7-11_align_with_child_value.htm">Exodus 21:7-11 mentions selling one's daughter;
