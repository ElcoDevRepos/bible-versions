This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Exodus narrative, where Moses often turns to God in times of crisis (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>, <a href="/numbers/11-2.htm">Numbers 11:2</a>). It highlights the importance of prayer and reliance on God in leadership and personal challenges. This act of crying out is a model of faith and dependence on divine intervention.<p><b>and the LORD showed him a log</b><br>The LORD's response to Moses' plea is both practical and miraculous. The log, or tree, symbolizes God's provision and guidance. In biblical typology, wood often represents humanity or the cross of Christ, suggesting a foreshadowing of redemption and transformation through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). The act of God showing Moses the log emphasizes divine revelation and the importance of obedience to God's instructions.<p><b>And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened</b><br>The transformation of the bitter waters at Marah into sweet, drinkable water is a miracle that underscores God's power over creation and His care for His people. This event is reminiscent of other biblical miracles involving water, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) and Jesus turning water into wine (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>). It serves as a physical manifestation of God's ability to bring life and blessing from bitterness and hardship.<p><b>There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance</b><br>This phrase indicates the establishment of a covenantal relationship between God and the Israelites. Statutes and ordinances are legal terms that refer to God's laws and commands, which are central to the covenant. This moment at Marah is a precursor to the giving of the Law at Sinai (Exodus 20), emphasizing the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands as a condition for His continued blessing and presence.<p><b>and there He tested them</b><br>The testing at Marah is part of a broader theme of testing throughout the Israelites' journey in the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). It serves to reveal the hearts of the people and their willingness to trust and obey God. This test is not for God's benefit, but for the Israelites to understand their dependence on Him. It foreshadows the testing of faith seen in the New Testament, where believers are called to endure trials as a means of spiritual growth and maturity (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

Moses&#8217; immediate response was prayer, turning frustration into intercession. Scripture repeatedly shows that God hears such cries: &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). Earlier, at the Red Sea, Moses had cried out and God parted the waters (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15-16</a>). The pattern is clear: dependence on the Lord precedes deliverance (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD showed him a log</b><p>God&#8217;s answer was specific and practical&#8212;He &#8220;showed&#8221; Moses exactly what to do. The wording points to divine revelation rather than human ingenuity. Similarly, God provided a ram for Abraham at just the right moment (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>) and revealed an iron ax head&#8217;s recovery plan to Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6</a>). When we seek Him, He gives wisdom generously (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>) and directs our paths (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He cast it into the waters</b><p>Moses obeyed without hesitation. Obedience so often looks simple yet grows out of trust: march around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>), dip seven times in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>), wash in Siloam (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>). Faith is demonstrated in action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). Moses didn&#8217;t question how a log could purify a spring; he simply followed God&#8217;s instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The waters were sweetened</b><p>The moment the log hit the water, the bitterness vanished&#8212;an undeniable, literal miracle. God who turned water to wine (<a href="/john/2-9.htm">John 2:9</a>) and healed Jericho&#8217;s spring through Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>) here transformed Marah into a source of life. It shows His power to meet physical needs and hints at His ability to turn life&#8217;s bitterness into sweetness (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). The people drank, refreshed and reminded that the Lord is Jehovah-Jireh, the One who provides.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance</b><p>Provision was accompanied by instruction. Verse 26 elaborates: obedience to God&#8217;s commands would keep Israel free from the plagues of Egypt. God&#8217;s statutes are protective, not restrictive (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-16</a>). Every miracle is an invitation to deeper covenant faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He tested them</b><p>Marah was both blessing and test. God wanted Israel to see whether they would trust Him before the next challenge arose (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). Trials reveal what is in the heart, refining faith &#8220;more precious than gold&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>). Passing the test would position Israel for continued guidance and provision; failing would expose the need for further refinement (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a> recounts a real event that pairs divine grace with personal responsibility. Moses prayed, God revealed, Moses obeyed, God acted, and then He taught and tested His people. The episode affirms that the Lord can instantly transform bitter circumstances, yet He uses those very moments to shape obedient, faith-filled hearts who walk in His statutes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The Lord shewed him a tree.</span>--There are trees which have the power of sweetening bitter water; but none of them is at present found in the Sinaitic peninsula, and the Arabs are not now acquainted with any means of rendering the bitter waters of Howarah and the neighbouring springs palatable. Perhaps in ancient times there were forms of vegetable life in the peninsula which do not now exist there. Moses would scarcely have been "shown a tree" unless the tree had some virtue of its own; but, on the other hand, the tree alone is scarcely to be credited with the entire effect. As in so many other instances, God seems to have made use of nature, as far as nature could go, and then to have superadded His own omnipotent energy in order to produce the required effect. (Compare our blessed Lord's method in working His miracles.)<p><span class= "bld">He made for them a statute and an ordinance.- </span>God took advantage of the occasion to draw a lesson from it. He promised that, as He had healed the waters, so, if the Israelites would henceforth faithfully keep His commandments, He would "heal" <span class= "ital">them </span>(<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm" title="And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.">Exodus 15:26</a>), keeping them free from all the diseases of Egypt, and from the far greater evil involved in their own corrupted nature and infirmity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shewed him a tree.</span> - Several trees or plants belonging to different parts of the world, are said to possess the quality of rendering bitter water sweet and agreeable; as the <span class="accented">nellimaram</span> of Coromandel, the <span class="accented">sassafras</span> of Florida, the <span class="accented">yerva Caniani</span> of Peru, and the <span class="accented">perru nelli</span> (Phylanthus emblica) of India. But none of them is found in the Sinaitic. peninsula. Burckhardt suggested (<span class="accented">Travels in Syria</span>. p. 474) that the berries of the <span class="accented">ghurkud</span> (Peganum retusum), a low thorny shrub which grows abundantly round the Ain Howarah, may have been used by Moses to sweeten the drink; but there are three objections to this. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Moses is not said to have used the berries, but the entire plant; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The berries would not have been procurable in April, since they do not ripen till June; and <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> They would not have produced any such effect on the water as Burckhardt imagined. In fact there is no tree or shrub now growing in the Sinaitic peninsula, which would have any sensible effect on such water as that of Ain Howarah; and the Bedouins of the neighbourhood know of no means by which it can be made drinkable. Many of the Fathers believed that the "tree" had no natural effect, and was commanded to be thrown in merely to symbolise the purifying power of the Cross of Christ. But to moderns such a view appears to savour of mysticism. It is perhaps most probable that there was some tree or shrub in the vicinity of the bitter fountain in Moses' time which had a natural purifying and sweetening power, but that it has now become extinct. If this be the case, the miracle consisted in God's pointing out the tree to Moses, who had no previous knowledge of it<span class="cmt_word">. The waters were made sweet</span>. Compare the miracle of Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There he made for them a statute and an ordinance</span>. See the next verse. God, it appears, after healing the water, and satisfying the physical thirst of his people, gave them an ordinance, which he connected by a promise with the miracle. If they would henceforth render strict obedience to all his commandments, then he would "heal" them as he had healed the water, would keep them free at once from physical and from moral evil, from the diseases of Egypt, and the diseases of their own hearts. <span class="cmt_word">And there he proved them</span>. From the moment of their quitting Egypt to that of their entering Canaan, God was ever "proving" his people - trying them, that is - exercising their faith, and patience and obedience and power of self-denial, in order to fit them for the position which they were to occupy in Canaan. He had proved them at the Red Sea, when he let them be shut in between the water and the host of the Egyptians - he proved them now at Marah by a bitter disappointment - he proved them again at Meribah (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>); at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>); at Taberah (<a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>); at Kibroth-hattaavah (<span class="accented">ib</span>, verse 34); at Kadesh (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 13:26-33), and elsewhere. For forty years he led them through the wilderness" to prove them, to know what was in their heart" (<a href="/deuteronomy/8.htm">Deuteronomy 8</a>.), to fit them for their glorious and conquering career in the land of promise <span class="cmt_word">All these diseases</span>. See <a href="/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. Kalisch correctly observes that, though the Egyptians had the character in antiquity of being among the healthiest and most robust of nations (Herod. 2:77), yet a certain small number of diseases have always raged among them with extreme severity He understands the present passage of the plagues, which, however, are certainly nowhere else called "diseases." There is no reason why the word should not be taken literally, as all take it in the passages of Deuteronomy above cited. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Moses] cried out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7779;&#183;&#8216;aq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
