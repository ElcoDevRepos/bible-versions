This divine presence was first introduced in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>, where God led the Israelites by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. The lifting of the cloud signified God's instruction for the Israelites to move. The tabernacle, a portable earthly dwelling place for God, was central to Israelite worship and community life, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people. The cloud's movement from above the tabernacle indicated a transition and a call to obedience and readiness to follow God's leading.<p><b>the Israelites would set out</b><br>The Israelites' journey was a physical and spiritual pilgrimage, reflecting their dependence on God's guidance. This movement was not arbitrary but was directed by God, emphasizing the importance of divine timing and direction. The setting out was a communal act, requiring unity and cooperation among the tribes. It also served as a test of faith and trust in God's provision and protection, as they ventured into unknown territories.<p><b>through all the stages of their journey</b><br>The journey of the Israelites from Egypt to the Promised Land was marked by various stages, each with its own challenges and lessons. These stages are detailed in the book of Numbers, particularly in chapters 33-36, which list the specific encampments. Each stage represented a step in the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants. The journey is often seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, with its trials, growth, and reliance on God's guidance. The stages also highlight the Israelites' need for perseverance and faithfulness, as they awaited the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable earthly dwelling place for God among the Israelites, constructed according to divine specifications given to Moses on Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloud.htm">The Cloud</a></b><br>A visible manifestation of God's presence and guidance, often referred to as the "Shekinah glory," which led the Israelites through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of 40 years during which the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, learning to trust and obey God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were led by the cloud, believers today are guided by the Holy Spirit.
