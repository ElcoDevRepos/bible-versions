It was located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle and was the place where sacrifices were made to atone for sin and express devotion to God. This altar symbolizes the need for atonement and points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>with its bronze grate</b><br>The bronze grate was a network or mesh placed on the altar to hold the sacrifices. Bronze, a durable metal, symbolizes judgment and endurance. The use of bronze in the altar's construction signifies the enduring nature of God's judgment against sin, which is ultimately satisfied in Christ's sacrificial death.<p><b>its poles</b><br>The poles were used to carry the altar, emphasizing the mobility of the Tabernacle as the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness. This mobility reflects the transient nature of life and the need for God's presence to accompany His people wherever they go. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that believers are the temple of the Holy Spirit, carrying God's presence within them (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><b>and all its utensils</b><br>The utensils used with the altar included items like firepans, shovels, basins, forks, and firepans, each serving a specific purpose in the sacrificial process. These tools highlight the detailed and orderly nature of worship prescribed by God, pointing to the importance of reverence and precision in approaching Him.<p><b>the basin with its stand</b><br>The basin, also known as the laver, was used by the priests for ceremonial washing before performing their duties. This act of washing symbolizes purification and the need for holiness when approaching God. In the New Testament, this concept is echoed in the call for believers to be cleansed by the washing of water with the word (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>), signifying spiritual purification through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were tasked with building the Tabernacle according to the divine instructions given to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among His people during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A key component of the Tabernacle where sacrifices were made to atone for the sins of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/basin_with_its_stand.htm">Basin with its Stand</a></b><br>Used for ceremonial washing by the priests, symbolizing purification and preparation for service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were called to follow God's instructions precisely, reminding us of the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The altar of burnt offering points to the necessity of atonement and foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice for our sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purification_and_service.htm">Purification and Service</a></b><br>The basin symbolizes the need for spiritual cleansing before serving God, emphasizing the importance of holiness in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_involvement.htm">Community Involvement</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle was a communal effort, illustrating the value of working together in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The Tabernacle was a tangible sign of God's presence among His people, reminding us that God desires to dwell with us today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_35_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_support_God_s_work_today.htm">How can we contribute to God's work like in Exodus 35:16 today?

Its location in the courtyard underscored that atonement through sacrifice must precede fellowship. <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a> spells out how a worshiper placed a hand on the animal, symbolically transferring guilt, and the animal&#8217;s blood made &#8220;atonement on his behalf&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>). Centuries later, <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> affirms, &#8220;without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&#8221; The altar therefore foreshadows the cross, where &#8220;Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as an offering and a fragrant sacrifice to God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its bronze grate</b><p>Attached inside the altar was &#8220;a grate of bronze network&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/27-4.htm">Exodus 27:4-5</a>). Bronze, a durable alloy, withstood the heat, signifying judgment that completely consumes sin (<a href="/numbers/16-38.htm">Numbers 16:38</a>). The grate held the sacrifice in place, and its four rings enabled priests to insert poles for transport. <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a> recalls another bronze object&#8212;the serpent Moses raised&#8212;linking that symbol of judgment and healing to Jesus &#8220;lifted up&#8221; for our salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its poles</b><p>&#8220;Make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze; the poles are to be inserted into the rings&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/27-6.htm">Exodus 27:6-7</a>). God intended His dwelling to move with His people, so every major furnishing had carrying poles (<a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13-15</a>). The poles remind us that forgiveness is not tied to one geographic spot; instead, God&#8217;s means of grace travels with His covenant people. <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, &#8220;I am with you always,&#8221; echoes that portability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All its utensils</b><p><a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a> lists shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans&#8212;all made of bronze. Each tool supported the offering: removing ashes, sprinkling blood, turning the sacrifice. <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a> notes that under the old covenant &#8220;Moses sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of ministry.&#8221; Even the smallest item mattered, showing that every detail of worship must be consecrated (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The basin with its stand</b><p>Beyond sacrifice, cleansing was required. &#8220;Make a bronze basin for washing, with its stand, and place it between the tent of meeting and the altar&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>). Priests washed hands and feet before entering the tent or offering sacrifice &#8220;so that they will not die&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20-21</a>). This prefigures daily spiritual cleansing: Jesus told Peter, &#8220;Whoever has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; he is completely clean&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>). Believers, though fully justified, still need continual washing by &#8220;the water of the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a> catalogs the altar, grate, poles, utensils, and basin to spotlight God&#8217;s ordered plan for access, atonement, and ongoing cleansing. The altar points to Christ&#8217;s once-for-all sacrifice; the bronze grate and utensils illustrate complete judgment on sin; the poles reveal God&#8217;s presence moving with His people; the basin calls us to daily purification. Together they announce that holy worship is possible only through God-provided sacrifice and continual cleansing, truths fulfilled perfectly in Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16</span> is a reference to <a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>, <a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/35-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the altar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(miz&#183;ba&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4196.htm">Strong's 4196: </a> </span><span class="str2">An altar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of burnt offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
