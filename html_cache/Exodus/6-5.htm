The Israelites' groaning reflects their deep distress under Egyptian bondage, a situation that had persisted for centuries since the time of Joseph. This groaning is not just physical but also spiritual, as they long for deliverance. The Bible often portrays God as one who hears the cries of the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). This hearing is not passive; it indicates God's readiness to act. The groaning can be seen as a form of prayer, aligning with <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>, where the Spirit intercedes with groans too deep for words.<p><b>whom the Egyptians are enslaving</b><br>The enslavement of the Israelites by the Egyptians is a historical reality corroborated by various archaeological findings, such as the depiction of Semitic slaves in Egyptian art. This enslavement was both a physical and spiritual oppression, as Pharaoh's regime sought to suppress the Israelites' growth and influence (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>). The Egyptians' harsh treatment of the Israelites is a recurring theme in the narrative, symbolizing the broader struggle between God's people and oppressive worldly powers. This enslavement prefigures the spiritual bondage of sin, from which Christ delivers believers (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>and I have remembered My covenant</b><br>God's remembrance of His covenant is a pivotal theme in the Bible, signifying His faithfulness and commitment to His promises. The covenant in question is likely the one made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising them land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 15</a>:18-21). This remembrance is not because God forgets, but rather it marks the time for action in fulfillment of His promises. The concept of covenant is central to understanding God's relationship with His people, culminating in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).
