His birth is recorded in <a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>. Reuben's name means "behold, a son," reflecting Leah's hope for Jacob's affection. Reuben's actions, such as sleeping with Bilhah, his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>), led to the loss of his birthright, which was later given to Joseph's sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>). Reuben's tribe settled east of the Jordan River, in a region known for its pastoral lands, which aligns with the tribe's reputation for being shepherds.<p><b>Simeon</b><br>Simeon is the second son of Jacob and Leah. His name means "heard," as Leah believed God heard her plight (<a href="/genesis/29-33.htm">Genesis 29:33</a>). Simeon, along with his brother Levi, is known for the violent act against the city of Shechem in retaliation for the defilement of their sister Dinah (Genesis 34). This act led to Jacob's curse on their anger (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). The tribe of Simeon eventually became absorbed into the tribe of Judah, losing its distinct identity, which is reflected in the blessing of Moses where Simeon is not mentioned (Deuteronomy 33).<p><b>Levi</b><br>Levi is the third son of Jacob and Leah. His name means "attached," as Leah hoped Jacob would become attached to her (<a href="/genesis/29-34.htm">Genesis 29:34</a>). Levi, like Simeon, was involved in the massacre at Shechem. However, the tribe of Levi was later set apart for priestly duties, as seen in <a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, where the Levites stood with Moses against idolatry. This tribe did not receive a territorial inheritance like the others but was given cities throughout Israel (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). The Levitical priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>Judah</b><br>Judah is the fourth son of Jacob and Leah. His name means "praise," as Leah praised the Lord at his birth (<a href="/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>). Judah's leadership qualities are evident in his role in the story of Joseph, where he offers himself as a substitute for Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18-34</a>). The tribe of Judah became the most prominent, producing King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the scepter not departing from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Judah's territory included Jerusalem, the future capital of Israel, and the center of Jewish worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah.

The order is different from that observed in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>, and seems intended to do honour to legitimate, as opposed to secondary, wedlock. The omission of Joseph follows necessarily from the exact form of the opening phrase, "These are the names of the children of Israel, which <span class="accented">came into Egypt with Jacob."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</span>. This is manifestly intended as a repetition of <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>, and throws the reader back upon the details there adduced, which make up the exact number of "seventy souls," by the inclusion of Jacob himself, of Joseph, and of Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The inaccuracy by which Jacob is counted among his own descendants, is thoroughly Oriental and Hebraistic, however opposed to Western habits of thought. To stumble at it shows a narrow and carping spirit. (Compare note on Genesis 46:15.) <span class="cmt_word">For Joseph was in Egypt already</span>. Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e</span>., has not been mentioned with the other sons of Jacob, since he did not "come into Egypt with Jacob," but was there previously.
