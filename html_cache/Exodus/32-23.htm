The request for "gods who will go before us" indicates a lack of faith in the invisible God who had led them out of Egypt. This mirrors the human tendency to seek visible assurance in times of uncertainty. Theologically, this act of idolatry is a direct violation of the first two commandments given in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>, which prohibit the worship of other gods and the creation of idols. The Israelites' demand for gods also echoes the practices of surrounding nations, highlighting the cultural pressures they faced.<p><b>As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,</b><br>The reference to "this Moses" suggests a dismissive attitude, indicating a loss of respect and trust in their leader. Moses had been on Mount Sinai for an extended period (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), and his absence led to uncertainty and fear among the people. Historically, Moses is a central figure in the Exodus narrative, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery. His role as a mediator between God and the people is crucial, and this statement reflects the Israelites' struggle with faith in both their human leader and in God. The phrase "who brought us up out of the land of Egypt" acknowledges the miraculous deliverance they experienced, yet their current actions show a disconnect from that past faithfulness.<p><b>we do not know what has happened to him!&#8217;</b><br>This expression of uncertainty highlights the Israelites' impatience and lack of trust. Moses' prolonged absence on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>) led to fear and doubt, causing the people to seek immediate solutions. This situation underscores the human tendency to doubt in the face of delayed expectations. Biblically, this moment is pivotal as it sets the stage for the golden calf incident, a significant act of rebellion against God. Theologically, it serves as a warning against the dangers of impatience and the importance of steadfast faith. This phrase also foreshadows future instances where the Israelites struggle with trust and obedience, such as in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>, when they express a desire to return to Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
