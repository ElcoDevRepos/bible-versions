In the context of Exodus, Moses expresses his insecurity about his speaking abilities (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). God responds by appointing Aaron, Moses' brother, to be his mouthpiece. This reflects a pattern seen throughout Scripture where God uses human intermediaries to convey His message, such as the prophets. The act of putting words in Aaron's mouth signifies divine inspiration and authority, similar to how God later inspires the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). This also prefigures the role of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, who empowers believers to speak God's truth (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><b>I will help both of you to speak,</b><br>God's promise to help both Moses and Aaron underscores His active involvement in their mission. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God equips those He calls (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). The assurance of God's help is crucial for Moses, who feels inadequate for the task. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God often chooses the weak and humble to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). The promise of help also foreshadows the New Testament promise of the Holy Spirit, who aids believers in their witness (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>and I will teach you what to do.</b><br>God's commitment to teach Moses and Aaron what to do emphasizes His role as the ultimate guide and teacher. This divine instruction is not limited to speech but extends to actions, ensuring that Moses and Aaron fulfill God's will accurately. This teaching role of God is seen throughout Scripture, where He instructs His people through the Law, the prophets, and ultimately through Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The promise of teaching also points to the New Covenant, where believers are taught by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_john/2-27.htm">1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2</a>:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

Each believer has a role that cannot be delegated away.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and put the words in his mouth</b><p>- Moses is to transmit God&#8217;s exact message to Aaron, not his own paraphrase (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>; &#8220;I will put My words in his mouth&#8221;).<p>- The picture is almost literal: Moses hands over God&#8217;s words as if placing them into Aaron&#8217;s mouth, ensuring verbal accuracy.<p>- Jeremiah experienced the same when the Lord said, &#8220;I have put My words in your mouth&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p>- Application: Scripture is God-breathed (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). Our task is to pass it on faithfully, resisting the urge to soften, embellish, or truncate what God has spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will help both of you to speak</b><p>- The Lord promises divine enablement for Moses and Aaron alike.<p>- Bullet points of reassurance:<p>&#8226; Divine presence: &#8220;I will be with your mouth&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine power: &#8220;The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine boldness: After prayer, &#8220;they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>).<p>- By helping both men, God unites them in mission, erasing any hierarchy of worth and emphasizing shared dependence on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will teach you what to do</b><p>- God&#8217;s tutoring extends beyond speech to action; He will instruct their steps (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>, &#8220;I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go&#8221;).<p>- The phrase anticipates ongoing guidance throughout the Exodus narrative&#8212;plagues, Passover, Red Sea.<p>- Jesus echoes this promise for New-Covenant believers: &#8220;The Holy Spirit will teach you all things&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: obedience requires continual listening; God&#8217;s leadership is not a one-time download but a lifelong classroom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a> shows a gracious yet firm God. He commands Moses to speak, hands over precise words for Aaron, supplies divine help for both mouths, and pledges continuing instruction for every action. The verse models faithful transmission of God&#8217;s word, reliance on His enabling power, and readiness to follow His step-by-step teaching.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt . . . put words in his mouth,</span> <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Tell him what he is to say--furnish the matter of his speeches, which he will then clothe with appropriate language.<p><span class= "bld">With thy mouth.</span>--Suggesting the matter to thee.<p><span class= "bld">With his mouth.</span>--Suggesting the language to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth</span>.
