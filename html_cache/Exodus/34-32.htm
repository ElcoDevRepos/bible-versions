The Israelites coming near signifies their readiness to receive God's commandments. This gathering reflects the communal nature of Israel's covenant relationship with God, emphasizing the importance of collective obedience and accountability. The Israelites' approach also indicates their reverence and recognition of Moses as God's chosen mediator.<p><b>and Moses commanded them</b><br>Moses acts as the intermediary between God and the Israelites, a role he consistently fulfills throughout the Exodus narrative. His authority to command comes directly from his encounters with God, highlighting the importance of leadership that is grounded in divine instruction. This mirrors the role of prophets and leaders throughout the Old Testament who convey God's will to His people.<p><b>to do everything that the LORD had told him</b><br>This underscores the comprehensive nature of God's commandments, which cover all aspects of life, including moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. The emphasis on "everything" indicates that partial obedience is insufficient; the Israelites are called to full compliance. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings are contingent upon obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>on Mount Sinai</b><br>Mount Sinai is a significant location in biblical history, serving as the site where God reveals His law to Moses. It is a place of divine encounter and revelation, symbolizing God's holiness and the establishment of His covenant with Israel. The mountain is traditionally identified with Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula, though its exact location remains debated.
