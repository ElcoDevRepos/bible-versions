The master had the authority to give a wife to his servant, often another servant or slave. This reflects the patriarchal and hierarchical structure of society at the time, where the master had significant control over the lives of his servants. The giving of a wife by the master indicates a contractual relationship, where the servant's personal life was intertwined with his service.<p><b>and she bears him sons or daughters</b><br>Children born to a servant couple were considered part of the master's household. This reflects the cultural and legal norms of the time, where offspring of slaves were typically regarded as the property of the master. The birth of children in this context underscores the continuation of the master's lineage and wealth, as children would contribute to the household's labor force.<p><b>the woman and her children shall belong to her master</b><br>This phrase highlights the legal status of the wife and children as property of the master. It underscores the lack of autonomy and rights for slaves and their families in ancient Israelite society. This legal stipulation ensured that the master's investment in the servant's family remained within his control, maintaining the economic and social structure of the household.<p><b>and only the man shall go free</b><br>The Hebrew servant was to be released after six years of service, as outlined in the broader context of <a href="/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>. However, the freedom granted to the servant did not extend to his wife and children if they were given by the master. This provision emphasizes the servant's individual liberation while maintaining the master's rights over the family. It reflects the tension between personal freedom and social obligations within the covenant community. This situation also foreshadows the concept of redemption and liberation found in the New Testament, where Christ offers freedom to all who are bound, transcending social and legal constraints.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant.htm">Hebrew Servant</a></b><br>A man who has sold himself into servitude, often due to debt or poverty, and is subject to the laws of servitude outlined in Exodus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The owner of the servant, who has the authority to give the servant a wife and make decisions regarding the family unit within the context of servitude.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife_and_children.htm">Wife and Children</a></b><br>The family given to the servant by the master, who remain under the master's ownership according to the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_society.htm">Israelite Society</a></b><br>The cultural and legal context in which these laws were given, reflecting the social and economic structures of ancient Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mosaic_law.htm">Mosaic Law</a></b><br>The broader legal framework given to the Israelites through Moses, of which this law is a part, aiming to regulate social justice and relationships.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_servitude_in_context.htm">Understanding Servitude in Context</a></b><br>The laws of servitude in Exodus reflect the economic realities of ancient Israel and are not endorsements of slavery as understood in modern terms.

During that term his master had authority not only over his labor but, at times, over major life arrangements&#8212;marriage included (compare <a href="/genesis/24-34.htm">Genesis 24:34&#8211;40</a> where masters acted decisively for servants).<p>&#8226; The wife in view was usually a female servant already owned by the master (<a href="/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>), highlighting that this arrangement concerned people under the same household authority, not random matchmaking.<p>&#8226; Such provision protected the woman from poverty and gave the man companionship, paralleling God&#8217;s declaration that &#8220;it is not good for the man to be alone&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>).<p>Cross references in context: <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2&#8211;3</a>;

The provision also preserved familial integrity for the woman; remaining with her children under a familiar roof protected her from abandonment or destitution (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>Cross references in context: <a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>;

Upon the servant&#8217;s release after six years, only he automatically gained freedom; the family did not. This safeguarded both parties: the servant retained the right to liberty, while the master&#8217;s household remained intact. The provision also set up a gracious option&#8212;lifelong service driven by love&#8212;pointing ahead to the believer&#8217;s willing devotion to the Lord who redeems and adopts us into His own household.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) If his master have given him a wife.--If, however, the Hebrew slave, being previously unmarried, had been allowed by his master to take to wife one of his female slaves, then, when the husband claimed his freedom the wife could not claim hers.

If the slave was unmarried when he went into servitude, or if his wife died, and his master then gave him a wife from among his female slaves, the master was not to lose his property in his female slave by reason of having permitted the marriage. When the man claimed his freedom at the end of the sixth year, he was to "go out" alone. Should children have been born, they were also to be the property of the master and to remain members of his household. No doubt these provisos, which cannot be regarded as unjust, had the effect of inducing many Hebrew slaves not to claim their release (vers. 5, 6). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his master</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
