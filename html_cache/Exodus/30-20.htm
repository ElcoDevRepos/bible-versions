It served as the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The requirement for the priests to wash before entering underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity when approaching Him. This practice foreshadows the New Testament teaching of spiritual cleansing through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><b>or approach the altar to minister</b><br>The altar was the place where sacrifices were offered to God, symbolizing atonement and worship. Approaching the altar required the priests to be ceremonially clean, highlighting the importance of reverence and preparation in worship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of approaching God with a pure heart (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p><b>by presenting a food offering to the LORD</b><br>Food offerings, or grain offerings, were part of the sacrificial system established by God. They symbolized thanksgiving and dedication to God, acknowledging His provision. The offerings were a type of Christ, who is the ultimate offering and sustenance for believers (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>they must wash with water</b><br>The act of washing with water was a ritual purification process, signifying the removal of impurity and sin. This practice points to the necessity of spiritual cleansing, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through baptism and the washing of regeneration by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><b>so that they will not die</b><br>The severe consequence of death for failing to wash emphasizes the seriousness of approaching a holy God without proper preparation. It serves as a reminder of the holiness and justice of God, as well as the need for atonement. This points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who died to cleanse humanity from sin and enable believers to approach God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>The primary individuals involved in this verse are the priests, specifically Aaron and his sons, who were appointed to serve in the Tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>This was the sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites.

Every step a priest took toward that sanctuary was a step into holiness. Because God is perfectly holy, He required His ministers to approach with clean hands and a pure heart (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>). The laver set between the altar and the tent (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17&#8211;19</a>) reminded them that fellowship with the LORD cannot be casual. Even today, believers are urged to &#8220;draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or approach the altar to minister</b><p>The bronze altar in the courtyard was the place of sacrifice (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1&#8211;8</a>). When priests drew near that altar, they represented the people before God (<a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-5.htm">Numbers 18:5</a>). Service there was never a performance; it was intercession&#8212;an echo of the greater ministry Christ would fulfill as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25&#8211;27</a>). The approach required intentional preparation: no dirt of daily life was to cling to the one handling holy things.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By presenting a food offering to the LORD</b><p>&#8220;Food offering&#8221; covers grain offerings, portions of peace offerings, and other gifts burned on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1&#8211;3</a>; 3:11). These fragrant offerings symbolized fellowship, thanksgiving, and total devotion (<a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-17.htm">Psalm 116:17</a>). Every priestly gesture pointed forward to the ultimate offering of Christ, who &#8220;gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). Clean hands underscored the purity of the gift and the sincerity of the worshiper (<a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They must wash with water</b><p>The act was simple&#8212;water from the laver over hands and feet&#8212;but the message was profound: cleansing precedes communion (<a href="/exodus/40-30.htm">Exodus 40:30&#8211;32</a>). Physical washing taught Israel a spiritual reality later clarified in Christ, who told His disciples, &#8220;Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>). In the new covenant, water pictures the Word and the Spirit who cleanse our walk (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). Yet the principle remains: God&#8217;s servants still need ongoing cleansing from the stains picked up in daily life (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that they will not die</b><p>The warning is stark. Casual or defiled worship in the presence of a holy God brought judgment (<a href="/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>). The laver therefore became a safeguard of grace&#8212;God provided the means to avoid death by offering cleansing. Even now, &#8220;our God is a consuming fire&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). Reverent, cleansed worship is not optional; it is life-preserving. Christ&#8217;s finished work secures our standing (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9&#8211;10</a>), yet His holiness still calls us to &#8220;offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a> teaches that God&#8217;s servants must approach Him with intentional, visible purity. Every move&#8212;from entering the sanctuary, to serving at the altar, to offering gifts&#8212;required washing, highlighting both God&#8217;s holiness and His gracious provision of cleansing. The principle continues today: through the once-for-all sacrifice and ongoing intercession of Jesus, believers are cleansed and invited to serve, but always with reverent hearts that value purity in His holy presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">That they die not.</span>--Comp. <a href="/exodus/28-35.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goes in to the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, that he die not.">Exodus 28:35</a>; <a href="/exodus/28-43.htm" title="And they shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they come in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever to him and his seed after him.">Exodus 28:43</a>. It is not altogether easy to see why the death-penalty was threatened against neglect of certain ceremonial observances, and not of others.
