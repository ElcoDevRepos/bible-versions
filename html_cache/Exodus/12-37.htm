It is often associated with the city of Pi-Ramesses, a royal city built by Pharaoh Ramesses II. This departure marks the beginning of the Exodus, a pivotal event in Israelite history, symbolizing liberation from slavery. Succoth, meaning "booths" or "temporary shelters," was the first stop on their journey. This movement from Rameses to Succoth signifies the initial step in fulfilling God's promise to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land.<p><b>with about 600,000 men on foot</b><br>The number 600,000 refers specifically to the men, likely those of fighting age, suggesting a total population of around two million when including women and children. This large number underscores the magnitude of the Exodus and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The logistics of moving such a large group highlight the miraculous nature of God's provision and guidance.<p><b>besides women and children</b><br>The mention of women and children emphasizes the family units that made up the Israelite community. This detail highlights the comprehensive nature of the Exodus, involving entire households, not just a select group. It also reflects the cultural and societal structure of the time, where men were often counted separately in censuses and military contexts.

Each detail proclaims that our Lord triumphantly leads His people from slavery into the freedom of trusting, pilgrim dependence on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE DEPARTURE OF ISRAEL, THEIR NUMBERS, AND THE TIME OF THE EGYPTIAN SOJOURN.</span><p>(37-41) The two principal statements of this passage are--(1) that the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt lasted four hundred and thirty years; and (2) that at the time of the departure the number of the "men" (<span class= "ital">gebarim</span>) was six hundred thousand. This latter statement is evidently a rough one, but it is confirmed, and even enlarged, by the more accurate estimate of Numbers 1, 2, which goes into particulars with respect to the several tribes, and makes the exact amount of the adult male population, exclusive of the Levites, to be 625,540 (<a href="/numbers/2-32.htm" title="These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.">Numbers 2:32</a>). It would follow that the nation, at the time of its departure, was one of above two millions of souls.<p>Two difficulties are raised with respect to this estimate:--(1) Could the Israelites possibly have increased during their sojourn in Egypt from the "seventy souls" who went down with Jacob to two millions? (2) Is it conceivable that such a multitude, with their flocks and herds, could have quitted Egypt on one day, and marched in a body through the narrow <span class= "ital">wadys</span> of the Sinaitic region to the plain in front of Sinai? Could even that plain have contained them? With regard to the first point, before it can be decided we must ascertain what are the exact data. What is to be taken as the original number of those who "went down into Egypt?" what as the duration of the sojourn? It has been already shown (see the comment on <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm" title="And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.">Exodus 1:5</a>) that the descendants of Jacob who entered Egypt were probably a hundred and thirty-two rather than seventy; that they were accompanied by their wives and husbands; that they took with them also their "households," which were very numerous (see Note on <a href="/genesis/17-13.htm" title="He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.">Genesis 17:13</a>); and that the entire number is fairly estimated at "several thousands." Let us then place it at 3,000.<p>The duration of the sojourn in Egypt, stated in the Hebrew text at 430 years, is reduced by the LXX. and Samaritan Versions to half the time: <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to 215 years. If we accept Mr. Malthus's statement, that in the absence of artificial checks population will double itself every twenty years, we shall find that 3,000 persons might, in the space of two centuries, increase to above 3,000,000; so that even the 215 years of the Greek and Samaritan Versions would admit of such a multiplication as that required. But as there is no sufficient reason for preferring the Versions to the Original, or the period of 215 to that of 430 years, we are entitled to regard the latter term as the real duration of the sojourn, in which case a doubling of the population every forty-five years would have produced the result indicated. Such a result under the circumstances, in the rich soil of Egypt, in the extensive territory granted to the Israelites, and with God's special blessing on the people, is in no way surprising.<p>The difficulty of handling so vast a body, and marching them from Goshen to the Red Sea, and from the Red Sea to Sinai, remains, and, no doubt, is considerable. But we must remember that as far as Marah the country was perfectly open, and allowed of any extension of the line of march on either flank. After this, the <span class= "ital">wadys</span> were entered, and the real difficulties of the journey began. Probably the host spread itself out, and proceeded to the rendezvous in front of the Ras Sufsafeh by several routes, of which Moses traces only the one which he himself followed. The plain Er-Rahah, according to the calculations of the best engineers, would have contained the entire multitude; but it is unnecessary to suppose that all were at any one time present in it. The whole Sinaitic district was probably occupied by the flocks and herds, and the herdsmen who tended them. Many of the tents may have been pitched in the Wady-ed-Deir and the Seil Leja. All that the narrative requires is that the <span class= "ital">main body</span> of the people should have been encamped in front of Sinai, have heard the Decalogue delivered, and consented to the covenant.<p>(37) <span class= "bld">From Rameses to Succoth.</span>--The difference between the Raamses of <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm" title="Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.">Exodus 1:11</a> and the Rameses of this passage is merely one of "pointing;" nor is there the least ground for supposing that a different place is intended. Pi-Ramesu was the main capital of the kings of the nineteenth dynasty, having superseded Tanis, of which it was a suburb. (See Note on <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm" title="Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.">Exodus 1:11</a>.) Succoth has been identified by Dr. Brugsch with an Egyptian town called Thukot; but it is probably a Semitic word, signifying "tents" or "booths." The district south-east of Tanis is one in which clusters of "booths" have been at all times common. Some one of these--situated, perhaps, near the modern Tel-Dafneh, fifteen miles south-east of Tanis--was the first halt of the Israelites. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-39.</span> - THE DEPARTURE. There are, no doubts, great difficulties in conceiving the departure on one day, from one place, of "six hundred thousand that were men, beside children." The difficulty is increased when we find (from <a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3-43</a>) that by "men" is meant males above twenty years of age. The entire body of Israelites is thus raised from over half a million to over two millions. The whole narrative, however, supposes some such number; and it is accepted by the best critics, as Ewald, Kalisch, Kurtz, Canon Cook, and others. As these two millions must have lived dispersed over a considerable space, and there could have been no advantage in their all assembling at Rameses (Tunis), we are probably to suppose the main body with Moses and Aaron to have stared from that place, while the others, obeying orders previously given, started from all parts of Goshen, and converged upon Succoth, which was the first rendezvous. Each body of travellers was accompanied by its flocks and herds, and followed by a number of slaves, dependants, and sympathisers not of Hebrew birth (ver. 38), which still further enlarged their numbers. The extremely open character of the country, and the firmness of the soil at the time of year, would facilitate the journey. There was no marching along roads, which indeed did not exist. Each company could spread itself out at its pleasure, and go its own pace. All knew the point of meeting, and marched towards it, in converging lines, there being no obstacle to hinder them. Arrived in the vicinity of Succoth, they could bivouac without hurt, in that fine climate, in the open air. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Rameses</span>. It has been doubted whether this "Rameses" is the same place as the "Raamses" of <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>. But the doubt scarcely seems to be reasonable. The two words differ only in the pointing. Brugsch has clearly shown that Rameses (Pa-Ramesu) was a town newly built in the reign of Rameses II., partly erected by himself, in the immediate vicinity of the old city of Tanis or Zoan. It was the favourite capital of both Rameses II. and Menephthah. (See Brugsch, <span class="accented">Hist. of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 96 and 128.) <span class="cmt_word">Succoth</span>. The meaning of the word "Succoth" is "booths." Mr. Greville Chester tells us that "huts made of reeds" are common at the present day in the tract south-east of Tunis, and suggests that the Succoth here mentioned may have been at Salahiyeh, fifteen miles due south of Tunis. Tel-Defneh, at the same distance to the south-east, is perhaps a more probable site. <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred</span> <span class="cmt_word">thousand</span>. See the Introductory paragraph. At the time of the numbering recorded in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, the males above twenty years of age were 625,550. Beside children. Rather, "beside families." The word used includes all the women, and the children under twenty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">journeyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
