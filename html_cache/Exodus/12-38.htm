The "mixed multitude" likely included non-Israelites who had witnessed the plagues and recognized the power of the God of Israel. This group may have consisted of Egyptians and other foreigners who lived in Egypt, possibly slaves or those seeking freedom and a new life. This diverse group foreshadows the inclusive nature of God's covenant, which would later be extended to Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-8</a>, <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>). The presence of the mixed multitude also introduces challenges, as seen later in the wilderness when they incite complaints and rebellion (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-6</a>).<p><b>along with great droves of livestock</b><br>The mention of "great droves of livestock" highlights the wealth and resources the Israelites took with them. Livestock was a sign of wealth and essential for survival, providing food, clothing, and sacrifices. This detail underscores God's provision and blessing, as the Israelites left Egypt not as impoverished slaves but as a people equipped for their journey. The livestock would also play a crucial role in the sacrificial system established later in the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 1-7).<p><b>both flocks and herds</b><br>The distinction between "flocks" and "herds" suggests a variety of animals, including sheep, goats, and cattle. This variety was necessary for different types of sacrifices and offerings, as well as for sustaining the community. The presence of both flocks and herds indicates the comprehensive nature of God's provision, ensuring that the Israelites had all they needed for their journey and future worship. This abundance can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would leave their place of bondage with great possessions (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mixed_multitude.htm">Mixed Multitude</a></b><br>This refers to a diverse group of people who were not Israelites but left Egypt with them.

God&#8217;s heart for the nations is already peeking through the Exodus story (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>also went up with them</b><p>&#8220;Went up&#8221; is the common biblical idiom for leaving a place of bondage and ascending toward God&#8217;s promised land (<a href="/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording reminds us that salvation is a shared journey. Israel did not leave Egypt alone; others joined, foreshadowing the invitation Jesus extends to &#8220;all who are weary&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the mixed company would later test Israel&#8217;s faith (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>). Scripture records both blessing and challenge when God&#8217;s people travel with those not fully committed to Him, a sober reminder to disciple newcomers well (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>; <a href="/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with great droves of livestock</b><p>The exodus included &#8220;great droves of livestock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Livestock represented wealth and provision (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). God&#8217;s people did not leave as paupers; they departed richly supplied, just as the Lord had promised (<a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, these animals ensured food, clothing, sacrifices, and economic stability during the wilderness years (<a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the abundance illustrates that redemption is not merely escape from slavery but entry into God&#8217;s fullness (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>both flocks and herds</b><p>The verse specifies &#8220;both flocks and herds,&#8221; indicating small animals (sheep, goats) and large (cattle).<p>&#8226; The detail underlines completeness&#8212;nothing was left behind (<a href="/exodus/10-26.htm">Exodus 10:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Different types of animals would serve varied purposes: daily sustenance, offerings, and future breeding. God had equipped them for every need they would face (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This inventory anticipates the sacrificial system to be instituted at Sinai, where both &#8220;bulls and goats&#8221; would point forward to the ultimate Lamb (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a> records three complementary facts: a diverse crowd joined Israel, the journey was upward toward God&#8217;s promise, and abundant resources accompanied them. Taken together, the verse celebrates God&#8217;s inclusive invitation, His faithful provision, and the comprehensive nature of His rescue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">A mixed multitude went up also with them.</span>--Nothing is told us of the component elements of this "mixed multitude." We hear of them as "murmuring" in <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm" title="And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?">Numbers 11:4</a>, so that they seem to have remained with Israel. Some may have been Egyptians, impressed by the recent miracles; some foreigners held to servitude, like the Israelites, and glad to escape from their masters. It is noticeable that the Egyptian writers, in their perverted accounts of the Exodus, made a multitude of foreigners (Hyksos) take part with the Hebrews.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A mixed multitude went up also with them</span>. Kalisch supposes that these strangers were native Egyptians, anxious to escape the tyranny of the kings. Canon Cook suggests that they were "remains of the old Semitic population" of the Eastern provinces. Perhaps it is more probable that they consisted of fugitives from other subject races (as the Shartana) oppressed by the Pharaohs. We have again mention of this "mixed multitude" in <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>, where we find that they were the first to regret the "flesh and the fish, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlick" which they had eaten in Egypt freely (<span class="accented">ib.</span> 5). They thus set a bad example, which the Israelites followed. <span class="cmt_word">And flocks, and herds, even very much cattle</span>. Compare <a href="/exodus/10-26.htm">Exodus 10:26</a>. It has been noticed that this is important, as lessening the difficulties connected with the sustentation of the Israelites in the wilderness. But it increases, on the other hand, the difficulties connected with the march, and with the possibility of finding pasture for such large flocks and herds in the Sinaitic peninsula. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And a mixed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6154.htm">Strong's 6154: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arabia -- mixture, mixed company</span><br /><br /><span class="word">multitude</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;it&#183;t&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with great droves of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3515.htm">Strong's 3515: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heavy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">livestock,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4735.htm">Strong's 4735: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something bought, property, livestock, acquisition</span><br /><br /><span class="word">both flocks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6629.htm">Strong's 6629: </a> </span><span class="str2">Small cattle, sheep and goats, flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and herds.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;q&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1241.htm">Strong's 1241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Beef cattle, ox, a herd</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">OT Law: Exodus 12:38 A mixed multitude went up also (Exo.
