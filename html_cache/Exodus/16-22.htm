In the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, this day was significant as it was the day they were to gather extra manna to prepare for the Sabbath rest. This practice foreshadows the importance of the Sabbath in Jewish law and tradition, as later codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>).<p><b>they gathered twice as much food</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous provision of God, as the manna was only available in double portions on the sixth day. This ensured that the Israelites could observe the Sabbath without gathering food, emphasizing the importance of rest and trust in God's provision. The double portion also symbolizes God's abundant grace and care for His people.<p><b>two omers per person</b><br>An omer is a unit of measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to about 2 liters or 2 quarts. The specific measurement underscores the sufficiency of God's provision, ensuring that each person had enough to meet their needs.

The leaders reporting to Moses indicates a system of governance and communication within the Israelite camp.

When the Israelites, having collected what seemed to them the usual quantity of manna on the sixth day, brought it home and measured it, they found the yield to be, not an omer a head for each member of the family, but two omers. The result was a surprise and a difficulty. They could not consume more than an omer a-piece. What was to be done with the remainder? Was it to be destroyed, or kept? If kept, would it not "breed worms"? To resolve their doubts, the elders brought the matter before Moses, who replied - "This is that which the Lord hath said." It is to be supposed that, in his original announcement to the elders of God's purposes as to the manna, Moses had informed them that the quantity would be double on the sixth day (ver. 5); but his statement had not made any deep impression at the time, and now they had forgotten it. So he recalls it to their recollection. "This is no strange thing - nothing that should have surprised you - it is only what God said would happen. And the reason of it is, that to-morrow, the seventh day is, by God's ordinance, the rest of the Holy Sabbath," - or rather "a rest of a holy Sabbath to the Lord." Whether or no the Sabbath was a primeval institution, given to our first parents in Paradise (<a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>), may be doubted: at any rate, it had not been maintained as an institution by the Hebrews during their sojourn in Egypt; and this was, practically, to them, the first promulgation of it. (See Hessey's <span class="accented">Bampton Lectures</span>, p. 149.) Hence, in the original, it is not called "the sabbath," as if already known, but "a sabbath," - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a rest - until verse 29. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is that which the Lord hath said</span>. Rather, "said," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, declared to me when he announced the manna. See verse 5. It has been supposed that Moses had not communicated the declaration to the elders; but this seems unlikely. <span class="cmt_word">The rest of the holy sabbath</span>. If this translation were correct, the previous institution of the sabbath, and the knowledge of its obligation by the Hebrews, would follow; but the absence of the article is a strong indication that the whole idea was new, at any rate to those whom Moses was addressing. <span class="cmt_word">Bake that which ye will bake</span>, etc. "Do," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "as you have done on other days - bake some and seethe some - but also reserve a portion to be your food and sustenance to-morrow." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the sixth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
