It was made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, signifying its durability and the importance of the sacrifices made upon it. This altar was a place where offerings were made to atone for sin and to express devotion to God. It prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect and final atonement for sin.<p><b>near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting</b><br>Positioning the altar near the entrance underscores the necessity of atonement before entering into God's presence. The tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting, was the dwelling place of God among His people. This arrangement highlights the principle that reconciliation with God is required before fellowship with Him, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Christ is the way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering</b><br>The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, symbolizing the complete surrender to God. The grain offering, often accompanying the burnt offering, represented thanksgiving and dedication of one's labor to God. These offerings were a foreshadowing of Christ's complete dedication and sacrifice, fulfilling the law and offering Himself as the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's instructions, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. Moses' adherence to God's commands in setting up the tabernacle and its furnishings reflects the importance of following divine guidance. This obedience is mirrored in the life of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>), serving as a model for believers to live in accordance with God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was responsible for setting up the tabernacle and ensuring that the offerings were made according to God's commands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A key element in the tabernacle, located near the entrance, where sacrifices were made to God.
