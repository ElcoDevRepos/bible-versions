The use of "Look" indicates an urgent call to attention, suggesting a sense of alarm or concern. The Pharaoh is addressing his people, likely his advisors or the Egyptian populace, to highlight a perceived threat. This reflects a shift in Egyptian policy towards the Israelites, moving from a period of favor under Joseph to one of suspicion and hostility. Historically, this change may coincide with a new dynasty in Egypt that felt threatened by the growing Hebrew population.<p><b>&#8220;the Israelites have become too numerous</b><br>The Israelites, descendants of Jacob, had settled in Egypt during a time of famine and had grown significantly in number. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The rapid population growth of the Israelites is seen as a divine blessing, yet it also becomes a source of fear for the Egyptians. This fear of a large foreign population is a common theme in history, where minority groups are often viewed with suspicion by the majority.<p><b>and too powerful for us.</b><br>The perception of the Israelites as "too powerful" suggests that their numbers and potential influence posed a threat to Egyptian sovereignty. This fear may have been exacerbated by the Israelites' distinct cultural and religious identity, which set them apart from the Egyptians. The concern over their power foreshadows the later oppression and enslavement of the Israelites, as Pharaoh seeks to control and diminish their influence. This situation sets the stage for God's deliverance of His people, a central theme in the book of Exodus. The Israelites' eventual exodus from Egypt is a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin, as both involve liberation from bondage and the establishment of a covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who felt threatened by the growing population of the Israelites.
