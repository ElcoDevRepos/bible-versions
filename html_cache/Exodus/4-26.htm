In the context of <a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4</a>, God had sought to kill Moses because his son was not circumcised, which was a violation of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). The act of circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people, and failure to comply was seen as a serious breach. The intervention by Zipporah, Moses' wife, through the act of circumcision, appeased God's anger, demonstrating the importance of obedience to God's commands. This moment underscores the seriousness with which God regards His covenants and the necessity of adherence to His laws. It also foreshadows the concept of atonement, where an act of obedience or sacrifice can turn away divine wrath, a theme that is fully realized in the New Testament through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<p><b>(When she said, &#8220;bridegroom of blood,&#8221;</b><br>The term "bridegroom of blood" is unique and has been the subject of much interpretation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, blood was often associated with life, covenant, and purification. Zipporah's use of this phrase may reflect a cultural understanding of the life-giving and covenantal nature of blood. The act of circumcision, which involves the shedding of blood, was a physical sign of the covenant between God and His people. By calling Moses a "bridegroom of blood," Zipporah may be acknowledging the life-saving and covenant-affirming role that this act of obedience played. This phrase can also be seen as a typological foreshadowing of Christ, who is the ultimate "bridegroom" of the Church, and whose blood establishes the new covenant (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p><b>she was referring to the circumcision.)</b><br>Circumcision was a critical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants. It was a physical mark that set the Israelites apart from other nations and was a constant reminder of their unique relationship with God. In the historical and cultural context of the Israelites, circumcision was not merely a ritual but a profound act of obedience and identity. The reference to circumcision here highlights its importance in maintaining the covenant relationship with God. In the New Testament, circumcision becomes a metaphor for spiritual purity and dedication to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, where Paul speaks of a "circumcision of the heart." This transformation from a physical act to a spiritual reality is fulfilled in Christ, who brings the ultimate covenant relationship through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is on his way back to Egypt after being called by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery.

Zipporah&#8217;s phrase &#8220;bridegroom of blood&#8221; captures both the costliness and the protective power of covenant blood, linking Moses, his family, and ultimately all God&#8217;s people to the promise first given to Abraham. The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s holy demands are non-negotiable, yet His mercy swiftly follows genuine obedience, pointing forward to the greater blood of Christ that secures everlasting deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">So he let him go.</span>--God let Moses go, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> allowed him to recover--accepted Zipporah's act as sufficient, albeit tardy, reparation, and spared the life of her husband.<p><span class= "bld">Then she said.</span>--When Moses was sufficiently recovered, Zipporah explained to him why she had called him "a bloody husband;" it was "on account of the circumcisions," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the two circumcisions--of Gershom in Midian, many years previously, and now of Eliezer.

"God let Moses go" - allowed him to escape death, accepted Zipporah's tardy act as a removal of the cause of offence, and gave her husband back to her. Then she said, etc. This is not a second address of Zipporah to Moses, conceived in the same terms, but an explanation of her previous address. She called him "a bloody husband because of the circumcision." Literally, "of the circumcisions." The two circumcisions, of Gershom in Midian, and of Eliezer on the way to Egypt, are especially in the writer's mind. <p> CHAPTER 4:27, 28 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [the LORD] let him alone.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;rep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7503.htm">Strong's 7503: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sink, relax</span><br /><br /><span class="word">(When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1434;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;bridegroom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1514;&#1463;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7791;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2860.htm">Strong's 2860: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative by marriage, a circumcised child</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of blood,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she was referring to the circumcision.)</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;m&#363;&#183;l&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4139.htm">Strong's 4139: </a> </span><span class="str2">Circumcision</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/4-26.htm">OT Law: Exodus 4:26 So he let him alone (Exo.
