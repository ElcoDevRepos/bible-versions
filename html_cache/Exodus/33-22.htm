In the context of Exodus, God's glory is His divine presence, often associated with light and majesty. The concept of God's glory passing by is significant, as it indicates a moment of divine revelation and intimacy. In biblical history, God's glory is often linked to the tabernacle and later the temple, where His presence dwelt among His people (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The idea of God passing by also echoes other biblical instances where God reveals Himself, such as to Elijah on Mount Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>).<p><b>I will put you in a cleft of the rock</b><br>The cleft of the rock symbolizes a place of safety and protection. In the harsh and rugged terrain of the Sinai Peninsula, a cleft would provide shelter from the elements. Spiritually, this imagery conveys God's protection over Moses, shielding him from the full intensity of His glory, which no human can withstand (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The rock is often seen as a type of Christ, who is our spiritual refuge and strength (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>and cover you with My hand</b><br>This phrase illustrates God's personal care and protection. The anthropomorphic language of God's hand suggests His power and authority, as well as His intimate involvement in the lives of His people. The covering of Moses signifies God's grace and mercy, shielding him from the overwhelming holiness of God's presence. This act of covering can be seen as a precursor to the atoning work of Christ, who covers our sins and allows us to stand in the presence of God (<a href="/romans/4-7.htm">Romans 4:7</a>).<p><b>until I have passed by</b><br>The passing by of God indicates a temporary yet profound encounter. It underscores the transient nature of divine revelation in the Old Testament, where God's presence was often momentary and specific. This phrase also highlights the anticipation of a more permanent indwelling of God's presence, fulfilled in the New Testament through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>). The passing by can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The gesture declares that safety with God is relational, not merely positional.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until I have passed by</b><p>There is a time limit: Moses may see only after the glory moves on (<a href="/exodus/33-23.htm">Exodus 33:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence preserves life&#8212;&#8220;man shall not see Me and live&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s passing leaves an afterglow that sustains faith; Job felt something similar: &#8220;He passes me on the left, and I do not perceive Him&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-11.htm">Job 9:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Moments of revelation are gifts, but walking by faith fills the in-between (<a href="/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a> shows a holy God initiating relationship while safeguarding His servant. His glory approaches, He provides the rock refuge, He covers with His own hand, and He controls the timing. The verse assures us that encountering God&#8217;s majesty is both awe-inspiring and utterly secure because the same God who overwhelms also protects, guiding us to worship Him with reverent confidence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And will cover thee with my hand.--</span>Kalisch observes with justice that the mysteriousness of this obscure section "attains its highest climax in the three last verses" (<a href="/context/exodus/33-21.htm" title="And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on a rock:">Exodus 33:21-23</a>). Human language is, by its very nature, unfit for the expression of sublime spiritual truths, and necessarily clothes them in a materialistic garment which is alien to their ethereal nature. All that we can legitimately gather from this verse and the next is that Moses was directed to a certain retired position, where God miraculously both protected him and shrouded him, while a manifestation of His glory passed by of a transcendent character, and that Moses was allowed to see, not the full manifestation, but the sort of after-glow which it left behind, which was as much as human nature could endure.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will put thee in a clift</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the rock,</span> The "clift" has been identified with the "cave of Elijah" (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>); but the words used are different; and even were they the same, no identity could be established.
