Their questioning of Pharaoh indicates a growing dissent within the Egyptian leadership, highlighting the severity of the plagues and their impact on Egypt. This internal pressure reflects a shift in the narrative, where even those loyal to Pharaoh begin to see the futility of resisting God's will.<p><b>How long will this man be a snare to us?</b><br>The term "snare" suggests a trap or a source of ongoing trouble. Moses, as God's representative, had become a significant problem for Egypt, with each plague increasing in intensity. This phrase underscores the officials' frustration and desperation, as they recognize Moses' role in the calamities befalling Egypt. The use of "snare" also implies that Pharaoh's stubbornness is leading Egypt into further danger, a theme consistent with the biblical portrayal of sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God.</b><br>The officials' plea to let the Israelites go reflects a recognition of the power and authority of the LORD, the God of Israel. This acknowledgment is significant, as it contrasts with Pharaoh's hardened heart and refusal to submit to God's demands. The phrase "worship the LORD" emphasizes the purpose of the Israelites' departure, which is not merely for freedom but for the fulfillment of their covenant relationship with God. This request aligns with God's command to Moses in earlier chapters, highlighting the central theme of worship and obedience.<p><b>Do you not yet realize that Egypt lies in ruins?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to the devastation caused by the plagues, which have left Egypt economically and socially crippled. The officials' statement serves as a wake-up call to Pharaoh, urging him to see the reality of the situation. The phrase "lies in ruins" suggests widespread destruction, possibly including agricultural loss, economic collapse, and social unrest. This devastation is a direct consequence of Pharaoh's resistance to God's commands, illustrating the biblical principle that rebellion against God leads to ruin. The officials' insight foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come upon Egypt, culminating in the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against letting the Israelites go, despite the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to demand their release from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_officials.htm">Pharaoh&#8217;s Officials</a></b><br>Advisors to Pharaoh who recognized the devastation caused by the plagues and urged Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land suffering under the plagues sent by God as a consequence of Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments on Egypt, demonstrating God's power and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>Pharaoh's pride and stubbornness led to the ruin of Egypt.

First, the magicians were impressed, and said, "This is the finger of God" (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>). Then a certain number of the people "feared the word of the Lord, and made their servants and their cattle flee into the houses" (<a href="/exodus/9-20.htm" title="He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:">Exodus 9:20</a>). Now the very officers of the Court, those who were in the closest contact with the king, believed that the words of Moses would come true, and counselled the king to yield, and "let the men go." It has been supposed that they meant "the men only" (Knobel, Cook); but this is pure conjecture. The word used, which is not that of <a href="/exodus/10-11.htm" title="Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.">Exodus 10:11</a>, would cover women and children. The officers of the Court--rich landowners mostly--would dread impending ruin if the wheat and <span class= "ital">doora</span> crops were destroyed, and would intend to counsel entire submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh's servants said unto him</span>. This marks quite a new phase in the proceedings. Hitherto the courtiers generally had been dumb. Once the magicians had ventured to say - "This is the finger of God" (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>); but otherwise the entire court had been passive, and left the king to himself. They are even said to have "hardened their hearts" like him (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>). But now at last they break their silence and interfere. Having lost most of their cattle, and a large part of the year's crops, the great men became alarmed - they were large landed proprietors, and the destruction of the wheat and <span class="accented">doora</span> crops would seriously impoverish, if not actually ruin them. Moreover, it is to be noted that they interfere before the plague has begun, when it is simply threatened, which shows that they had come to believe in the power of Moses.
