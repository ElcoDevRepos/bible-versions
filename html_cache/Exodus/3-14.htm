Moses, a Hebrew raised in Pharaoh's palace and later a shepherd in Midian, encounters God at the burning bush on Mount Horeb. This divine encounter signifies God's intention to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, establishing Moses as His chosen leader. The direct communication underscores the personal nature of God's relationship with His people.<p><b>I AM WHO I AM</b><br>This declaration is one of the most profound revelations of God's nature. The phrase "I AM WHO I AM" (Hebrew: Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh) conveys God's self-existence, eternal presence, and unchanging nature. It emphasizes that God is not defined by human terms or limitations. This name reveals God's sovereignty and faithfulness, assuring Moses and the Israelites of His power and presence. Theologically, it connects to the concept of God as the eternal, self-sufficient being, foundational to understanding His divine nature.<p><b>This is what you are to say to the Israelites</b><br>God instructs Moses on how to communicate His message to the Israelites. This directive highlights the importance of Moses' role as a prophet and mediator between God and His people. It also reflects the need for clear and authoritative communication of God's will, ensuring that the Israelites understand the divine origin of their deliverance.<p><b>&#8216;I AM has sent me to you.&#8217;</b><br>The use of "I AM" as God's name signifies His eternal existence and unchanging nature. This statement assures the Israelites that their deliverance is orchestrated by the one true God, who is both personal and powerful. The phrase foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who identifies Himself with "I AM" in <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, linking His divine nature to the God of the Old Testament. This connection underscores the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Exodus to the coming of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The eternal, self-existent Creator who reveals Himself to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM," signifying His unchanging and self-sufficient nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
