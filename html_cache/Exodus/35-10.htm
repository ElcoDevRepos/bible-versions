In the ancient Near East, craftsmanship was highly valued, and artisans were often trained from a young age. The call for skilled craftsmen underscores the need for excellence and precision in the work of God. This also reflects the biblical principle that God equips individuals with specific talents and skills for His purposes, as seen in the gifting of Bezalel and Oholiab (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>).<p><b>come and make</b><br>The invitation to "come and make" indicates active participation and willingness. It suggests that God desires voluntary service from His people, not coerced labor. This mirrors the New Testament teaching of serving God with a willing heart (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). The act of making or creating is a reflection of God's own creative nature, as humans are made in His image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p><b>everything that the LORD has commanded:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's specific instructions. The construction of the Tabernacle was not left to human imagination but was to follow the divine blueprint given to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>). This obedience to God's command is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting the importance of following God's will precisely. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, as it was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people, foreshadowing Jesus as Immanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who conveyed God's instructions to the people regarding the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/skilled_craftsmen.htm">Skilled Craftsmen</a></b><br>Individuals among the Israelites endowed with specific skills and talents necessary for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that the Israelites built according to God's instructions, serving as a place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were called to contribute their skills and resources for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who commanded the construction of the Tabernacle and provided the design and instructions for its completion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call_to_service.htm">God's Call to Service</a></b><br>God calls each of us to use our unique skills and talents for His purposes.

Like Paul later urges in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, the Lord looks for cheerful givers and volunteers, not reluctant conscripts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>every</b><p>No one with relevant ability is excluded. All are welcome to serve. This echoes <a href="/numbers/4-49.htm">Numbers 4:49</a>, where each Levite receives an assigned task, and <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>, which calls believers to use &#8220;whatever gift he has received to serve others.&#8221; The scope is inclusive, encouraging broad participation in God&#8217;s work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>skilled craftsman</b><p>God values craftsmanship. The Spirit had already filled Bezalel and Oholiab &#8220;with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/35-31.htm">Exodus 35:31</a>). <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a> praises playing skillfully; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> urges that &#8220;whatever you do, work at it with all your heart.&#8221; Skill is not secular; it is sacred when dedicated to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among you</b><p>The resources needed for God&#8217;s project are already present in the community. Compare <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34&#8211;35</a>, where believers distribute goods so none lack. Ministry is supplied from within, not outsourced. The phrase also highlights shared responsibility; everyone has a part in the worshiping body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>come</b><p>Movement is required. Good intentions must translate into action. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> reminds us to be doers, not merely hearers. The craftsman&#8217;s first step is to show up where God is working, echoing <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;Here am I. Send me!&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and make</b><p>Service involves production, not passivity. <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6&#8211;8</a> lists gifts that result in tangible ministry. In <a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>, the wall rises because &#8220;the people worked with all their heart.&#8221; God&#8217;s vision becomes visible through obedient hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>everything</b><p>The call is comprehensive. Partial obedience is insufficient. Jesus affirms in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.&#8221; Likewise, Moses reminds Israel in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> not to add or subtract from God&#8217;s directives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD has commanded</b><p>The blueprint originates with God, not human imagination. <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a> (quoted in <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) stresses building &#8220;according to the pattern&#8221; shown on the mountain. By following divine instruction, the tabernacle will reveal God&#8217;s holiness and glory, prefiguring Christ, the true dwelling of God among men (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/35-10.htm">Exodus 35:10</a> is a gracious summons: everyone gifted by God is invited to step forward, offer skilled labor, and carry out every detail of His design.

But the second appeal is to some only. The "wise-hearted" alone can take part in the actual construction, and "make all that the Lord hath commanded." On the expression "wise ? hearted," see Note on <a href="/exodus/28-3.htm" title="And you shall speak to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:3</a>.
