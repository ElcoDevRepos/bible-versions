This fear is not terror but a recognition of God's sovereignty and moral law. In the biblical context, fearing God often leads to wisdom and righteous actions (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The midwives' actions can be seen as an early example of civil disobedience in the Bible, where God's law is prioritized over human edicts. This fear of God aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes obedience to God above all (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><b>and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed;</b><br>The king of Egypt, or Pharaoh, represents the oppressive political power of the time. His instruction to kill the Hebrew boys was a direct attempt to control and diminish the Israelite population, reflecting the historical context of Egyptian enslavement of the Israelites. The midwives' refusal to follow Pharaoh's command highlights their courage and moral conviction. This act of defiance is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<p><b>they let the boys live.</b><br>By allowing the boys to live, the midwives preserved the future of the Israelite people, including the birth of Moses, who would lead the Exodus. This act of preservation is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God uses individuals to protect His people and fulfill His promises (e.g., Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where the preservation of life points to Jesus, who brings eternal life. The midwives' actions demonstrate God's providence and the unfolding of His redemptive plan through seemingly small acts of faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midwives.htm">Midwives</a></b><br>These were Hebrew women tasked with assisting in childbirth.
