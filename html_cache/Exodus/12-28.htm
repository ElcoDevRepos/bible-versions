In the context of the Passover, their actions were a direct response to the instructions given by God through Moses and Aaron. This obedience is significant as it demonstrates their faith and trust in God's promise of deliverance. The act of going and doing is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of faith accompanied by action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>just what the LORD had commanded</b><br>The precision of their obedience underscores the importance of following God's instructions exactly as given. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where blessings are often contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The Israelites' adherence to God's command also prefigures the necessity of obedience to Christ's teachings in the New Testament (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>Moses and Aaron</b><br>Moses and Aaron serve as God's chosen leaders and mediators between Him and the Israelites. Their leadership is crucial during the Exodus, as they convey God's commands and guide the people. This leadership dynamic is mirrored in the New Testament with Jesus as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). Moses, in particular, is a type of Christ, as both are deliverers of their people (<a href="/acts/7-35.htm">Acts 7:35-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were living in Egypt at the time of the Exodus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and spokesperson, who assisted Moses in communicating God's commands to Pharaoh and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they were delivered during the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions demonstrate the importance of following God's instructions precisely.
