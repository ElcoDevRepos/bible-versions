The anointing oil, as described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>, was a unique blend of spices and olive oil, signifying the Holy Spirit's presence and empowerment. The fragrant incense, detailed in <a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>, was burned on the altar of incense, representing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The Holy Place, part of the Tabernacle, was where the priests performed their duties, and these elements underscored the holiness required in approaching God.<p><b>They are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's specific instructions. The detailed commands given to Moses for the construction and furnishing of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-31) highlight the necessity of following divine guidance precisely. This obedience reflects a broader biblical principle seen throughout Scripture, where adherence to God's commands leads to blessing and fulfillment of His purposes (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).

Incense symbolized prayer rising to God. David prays, &#8220;May my prayer be set before You like incense&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a> shows heavenly incense mingling with the prayers of the saints.

This room housed the lampstand, table of the Bread of the Presence, and the golden altar of incense (<a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>). Everything inside pointed to fellowship with God and was off-limits to casual use. Holiness matters: <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a> records the tragedy of unauthorized fire, proving that God&#8217;s dwelling cannot be approached on human terms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are to make them</b><p>God entrusts the actual crafting to Spirit-filled artisans.

Their hands would mix the oil, grind the spices, and fashion every tabernacle article. The partnership of divine gifting and human labor illustrates that obedient service is never a solo effort; God supplies what He commands (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to all that I have commanded you</b><p>Precision was non-negotiable.

When the work was finished, &#8220;Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-43.htm">Exodus 39:43</a>). Obedience brings blessing; Jesus affirmed, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/31-11.htm">Exodus 31:11</a> wraps up God&#8217;s marching orders: the craftsmen must produce the anointing oil and incense&#8212;symbols of consecration and communion&#8212;solely for the Holy Place, exactly as God detailed.
