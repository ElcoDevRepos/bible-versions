The shoulder pieces were integral to the ephod, serving both a functional and symbolic purpose. The fastening of the stones on the shoulder pieces signifies the priest's role in bearing the tribes of Israel before God. This act of fastening can be seen as a representation of the priest's duty to carry the spiritual burdens of the people, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Christ is depicted as our High Priest who bears our burdens.<p><b>as memorial stones for the sons of Israel</b><br>The stones served as a memorial, a physical reminder of the twelve tribes of Israel. Each stone was engraved with the name of a tribe, symbolizing the perpetual remembrance of the people before God. This concept of memorial stones is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>, where stones were set up as a memorial of crossing the Jordan River. The memorial aspect underscores the importance of remembering God's covenant and faithfulness to His people.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the instructions for the ephod and its components. The obedience of Moses and the artisans to God's commands highlights the importance of following divine instructions precisely. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, illustrating the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also prefigures the perfect obedience of Christ, who fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, as noted in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and receive the Law on Mount Sinai.
