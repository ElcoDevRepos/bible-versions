The miraculous events, such as the parting of the Red Sea, were not only significant for Israel but also served as a testimony to surrounding nations of God's power. Historically, news of such events would travel through trade routes and interactions among nations, causing fear and respect for the God of Israel. This fear is echoed in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where Rahab speaks of the terror that fell upon the inhabitants of Canaan upon hearing of Israel's exodus and victories. The trembling of nations can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory of God over all nations, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>.<p><b>anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia.</b><br>Philistia refers to the region inhabited by the Philistines, located along the southwestern coast of Canaan. The Philistines were known as one of Israel's primary adversaries throughout the Old Testament. The mention of Philistia here highlights the immediate threat perceived by neighboring regions upon witnessing God's intervention for Israel. This anguish is not just fear but a deep-seated anxiety over the potential threat posed by a nation whose God performs such mighty acts. The Philistines' fear is later confirmed in <a href="/1_samuel/4-7.htm">1 Samuel 4:7-8</a>, where they express dread over the presence of the God who struck Egypt. This phrase also serves as a type of Christ, as it prefigures the fear and awe that Jesus' miraculous works and ultimate victory over sin and death would inspire among both His followers and adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding peoples and tribes who would hear of God's mighty acts and be filled with fear.

History proves them right. Rahab in Jericho later testifies, &#8220;We have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). Centuries later, even pagan monarchs acknowledge Israel&#8217;s God because &#8220;the LORD has made His salvation known before the nations&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2</a>). The message: God&#8217;s works are public, undeniable, and newsworthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tremble</b><p>Hearing is one thing; trembling is another. The same God who shattered Pharaoh&#8217;s army now stands between the nations and Israel. Scripture repeatedly records that terror preceded Israel wherever the LORD led them (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>). Even mighty rivers and mountains react: &#8220;The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and writhed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>). The verse assures Israel that their enemies will not shrug off God&#8217;s reputation&#8212;they will shake because of it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>anguish will grip</b><p>&#8220;Tremble&#8221; speaks of fear; &#8220;anguish&#8221; points to an inner, paralyzing pain. Think birth pangs&#8212;inescapable and overwhelming (<a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). When God moves, emotional and psychological distress seize those who oppose Him (<a href="/psalms/48-5.htm">Psalm 48:5-6</a>). The line reminds Israel that the dread felt in Egypt during the plagues will now be reproduced in every hostile camp they encounter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the dwellers of Philistia</b><p>Philistia represents the first significant enemy territory on Israel&#8217;s horizon. Geographically close and historically hostile (<a href="/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2-3</a>), the Philistines would later capture the ark and experience divine judgment until they cried out in fear (<a href="/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10-12</a>). Moses&#8217; song predicts that very pattern: God&#8217;s fame will reach Philistia, grip its people with panic, and prepare the way for Israel&#8217;s future victories (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a> assures Israel that God&#8217;s victory at the Red Sea will echo across borders, evoke fear, cause deep anguish, and specifically unsettle the Philistines. The line invites us to trust that the LORD who once silenced hostile nations still defends His people today with the same power and reputation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The people.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">The peoples: i.e., </span>all the various tribes and nations of the desert and of Palestine--the Amalekites, Edomites, Philistines, Moabites, Amorites, &c.<p><span class= "bld">Shall hear, and be afraid.</span>--On the fear which was actually felt, see <a href="/numbers/22-3.htm" title="And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.">Numbers 22:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm" title="And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.">Joshua 2:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/9-3.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,">Joshua 9:3-15</a>, &c.<p><span class= "bld">The inhabitants of Palestina </span>are the Philistines, from whom the Holy Land derived the name which it still retains in most of the languages of modern Europe.

This is a Greek form. The Hebrew is Phelasheth, which would perhaps be best translated "Philistia." (Compare <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>.) The Philistine country was a strip of territory extending along the coast of the Mediterranean from a little below Gaze on the south, nearly to Mount Carmel on the north. It is curious that the philistines are not mentioned under that name on any of the early Egyptian monuments. They may perhaps be the Purusaia of the time of Rameses III., whom some however identify with the Pelasgi. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The nations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] tremble;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;g&#257;&#183;z&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; Paragogic nun<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7264.htm">Strong's 7264: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be agitated, quiver, quake, be excited, perturbed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anguish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2427.htm">Strong's 2427: </a> </span><span class="str2">A writhing, anguish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will grip</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1428;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;az)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_270.htm">Strong's 270: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grasp, take hold, take possession</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the dwellers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Philistia.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6429.htm">Strong's 6429: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistia -- a territory on the southern Mediterranean coast of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">OT Law: Exodus 15:14 The peoples have heard (Exo.
