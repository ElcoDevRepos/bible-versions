The frames, or boards, were integral to the structure, providing stability and form. The use of two frames here emphasizes the importance of symmetry and balance in the design, reflecting the orderliness of God's creation. The number two often symbolizes witness or testimony in the Bible, suggesting the tabernacle's role in bearing witness to God's presence among His people.<p><b>for the two back corners</b><br>The back corners of the tabernacle were crucial for structural integrity, ensuring the tent's stability. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, corners were often seen as points of strength. The tabernacle's design, including its corners, was a reflection of heavenly realities, as described in <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>, where the earthly tabernacle is a shadow of the heavenly one. The corners may also symbolize the completeness and perfection of God's dwelling place.<p><b>of the tabernacle</b><br>The tabernacle was the portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It served as a central place of worship and sacrifice, foreshadowing the coming of Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).
