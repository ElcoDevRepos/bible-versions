Aaron, the brother of Moses, was chosen by God to be the first high priest, and his sons were to serve as priests. This establishes the Aaronic priesthood, which is a hereditary priesthood passed down through Aaron's lineage. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>. The selection of Aaron and his sons underscores the importance of divine calling and ordination in spiritual leadership.<p><b>to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It was a sacred space where God would meet with Moses and the priests. The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a significant location, symbolizing the threshold between the common and the holy. This setting emphasizes the need for purification and preparation before entering into God's presence, reflecting the holiness required to approach God.<p><b>and wash them with water</b><br>The act of washing with water signifies purification and consecration. In the ancient Near Eastern context, washing was a common ritual for cleansing and preparing individuals for religious duties. This washing symbolizes the need for spiritual cleansing and sanctification before serving in the presence of God. It prefigures the New Testament concept of baptism, which represents the washing away of sin and the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. The washing of Aaron and his sons highlights the necessity of purity and holiness in those who minister before the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

Nothing is left to Moses&#8217; discretion; the priesthood begins exactly when and how the LORD commands (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>- The family line of Aaron is singled out, confirming God&#8217;s covenant choice of a hereditary priesthood (<a href="/numbers/3-3.htm">Numbers 3:3</a>).<p>- This call is public and accountable, underscoring that ministry is never self-appointed but divinely assigned (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><p>- The priests are brought &#8220;to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,&#8221; the very threshold of God&#8217;s earthly dwelling (<a href="/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-3.htm">Leviticus 8:3-4</a>).<p>- The entrance serves as a place of revelation and fellowship (<a href="/exodus/33-8.htm">Exodus 33:8-10</a>).

The act is physical, removing dust and uncleanness, while also pointing to inner purification (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p>- Water imagery runs throughout Scripture: the laver in the courtyard (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>), the red heifer rite (<a href="/numbers/19-17.htm">Numbers 19:17-19</a>), and later, baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).<p>- The washing anticipates Christ, who &#8220;gave Himself up&#8230;to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-26</a>) and who pours out &#8220;the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>- Yet in <a href="/bsb/exodus/40.htm">Exodus 40</a> it is first a literal bath, affirming that holiness begins with concrete obedience before it illustrates deeper truth (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12</a> records a simple, three-fold command that grounds priestly ministry in God&#8217;s timing, God&#8217;s place, and God&#8217;s cleansing. Aaron and his sons are chosen, brought to the Tent&#8217;s doorway, and washed&#8212;literally prepared to serve.
