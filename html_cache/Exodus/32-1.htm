The delay in Moses' return tested the patience and faith of the people. This period of waiting is significant, as it reveals the human tendency to doubt and lose faith when immediate results are not visible. The mountain, Sinai, is a critical location in biblical history, representing God's presence and the giving of the Law. The delay also serves as a test of the Israelites' faithfulness to God, who had just delivered them from Egypt.<p><b>they gathered around Aaron and said</b><br>Aaron, Moses' brother, was left in charge during Moses' absence. The people's gathering around Aaron indicates a collective pressure and a shift in leadership dynamics. Aaron's role is crucial here, as he is faced with the challenge of maintaining the people's faith in God. This moment foreshadows Aaron's later role as the first high priest, highlighting the importance of strong spiritual leadership. The gathering also reflects a communal decision-making process, which unfortunately leads to idolatry.<p><b>&#8220;Come, make us gods who will go before us.</b><br>The request for gods to lead them reveals the Israelites' struggle with faith and their inclination towards idolatry, a common practice in the ancient Near East. This desire for tangible gods contrasts sharply with the worship of the invisible, omnipotent God of Israel. The phrase "go before us" indicates a need for guidance and protection, roles that God had already fulfilled. This request echoes the practices of surrounding pagan cultures, where physical idols were believed to embody divine presence and power.<p><b>As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt</b><br>The reference to Moses as "this Moses" suggests a distancing or diminishing of his authority and role. Despite Moses being God's chosen leader who facilitated their deliverance from Egypt, the people's faith in him wavers in his absence. This reflects a broader theme of forgetfulness and ingratitude that recurs throughout the Israelites' journey. The mention of Egypt serves as a reminder of their miraculous deliverance, which they quickly overlook in their impatience.<p><b>we do not know what has happened to him!&#8221;</b><br>The uncertainty about Moses' fate highlights the Israelites' lack of trust in God's plan and timing. This statement underscores their fear and insecurity without their leader's visible presence. It also foreshadows the recurring theme of Israel's struggle with faith and obedience throughout their history. The people's reaction is a cautionary tale about the dangers of relying on human leaders rather than maintaining faith in God's sovereignty and promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is on Mount Sinai receiving the Law from God.

Leaving Moses still in the mount, he returns to the plain at its base in order to relate the events which had there occurred during Moses' absence. It has been suggested that Exodus 31 was originally followed by Exodus 35, and that Exodus 32-34 form a "distinct composition," which was subsequently inserted at this point (Cook). But this supposition is improbable. Exodus 35 does not cohere with Exodus 31. Passing from one to other, we should be sensible of a gap which required filling up. Neither does Exodus 32 commence like an independent narrative. It rests on the fact of the long delay of Moses in Sinai, which requires Exodus 25-31 to explain it; and its mention of "<span class= "ital">the </span>people," and "<span class= "ital">the </span>mount," without further designation, implies reference to something that has gone before. Exodus 32-34 occur really in their natural, their proper, and, no doubt, in their original place.<p><span class= "bld">The people gathered themselves together unto Aaron.</span>--Moses, before his departure, had left directions that the people should in any difficulty take the advice of Aaron <span class= "ital">and Hur </span>(<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm" title="And he said to the elders, Tarry you here for us, until we come again to you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come to them.">Exodus 24:14</a>). It is not surprising, however, that, when the difficulty arose, Aaron alone was consulted. Aaron had been jointleader with Moses from the first (see <a href="/context/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29-30</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-1.htm" title="And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.">Exodus 5:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you to your burdens.">Exodus 5:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-20.htm" title="And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:">Exodus 5:20</a>, &c.); Hur had only very recently been advanced into a position of authority (<a href="/exodus/17-10.htm" title="So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.">Exodus 17:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-14.htm" title="And he said to the elders, Tarry you here for us, until we come again to you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come to them.">Exodus 24:14</a>). He was, at the most, the Lepidus of the Triumvirate. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - THE IDOLATRY OF THE GOLDEN CALF. During the absence of Moses in Mount Sinai, an absence of nearly six weeks, the Israelites grew impatient, and regarding their leader as lost to them, and the Divine Presence which they had hitherto enjoyed as lost with him, insisted on having a symbol of that presence made for them, which should henceforth go in front of the host and so lead them on in their journeyings. It would seem that the pillar of the cloud, which had gone before them from Succoth to Sinai, was now removed from the camp, and resting upon the "mount" where Moses was (<a href="/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15</a>). Under these circumstances they wanted a visible tangible something, in which they could regard the Divine Presence as resting, and whereto they might offer worship and sacrifice (ver. 8). They therefore went to Aaron, whom Moses had bid them consult in any difficulty (<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>), and requested him to "make them a god." Aaron had not the courage to meet this request with a plain negative. As Augustine and Theodoret conjecture with much probability, he sought to turn them from their purpose by asking them to give up those possessions which he conceived that they most valued - viz, the personal ornaments of their wives and children. But he had miscalculated the strength of their fanaticism. The people immediately complied - the ornaments were brought in - and Aaron was compelled, either to fly from his word, or to lend himself to the people's wishes. He did the latter. Either looking to Egypt for a pattern, or falling back on some old form of Syrian or Chaldaean idolatry (see the comment on ver. 4), he melted down the gold and cast it into the form of a calf. The "god" being thus made, an altar was built to it (ver. 5) and sacrifice offered (ver 6). Such was the condition of affairs when Moses, having just received the two tables of stone, was warned by God of what had occurred, and bidden to descend from Sinai. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people saw that Moses delayed to come down.</span> He had been absent, probably, above a month. It was the first day of their worship when he descended; and a week would suffice for the collection of the ornaments, the formation of the mould, and the casting of the idol. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Aaron</span>. It is not clear why no mention is made of Hur, who had been made co-regent with Aaron (<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>); but perhaps Aaron was known to be the weaker of the two. Up, make us gods. Most moderns translate" a god." But the word is vague, and the speakers did not themselves perhaps care whether one idol was made or more. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall go before us</span>. The Israelites were apparently tired of their long delay at Sinai, and were anxious to proceed upon their journey. They wanted a visible god at their head, to give them confidence and courage. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We wot not what is become of him</span>. He might, they thought, be dead - he might have returned to Egypt - he might be going to stay always with God in the mount which they did not dare to approach. At any rate, he was lost to them, and they might never see him again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/32-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now when the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
