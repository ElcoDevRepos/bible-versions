In biblical context, being "called by name" signifies a personal and intentional selection by God, as seen with other figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>). It underscores the personal relationship and specific purpose God has for individuals.<p><b>Bezalel</b><br>Bezalel is the first person in the Bible described as being filled with the Spirit of God for a specific task (<a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>). His name means "in the shadow of God," suggesting divine protection and guidance. Bezalel's role as a craftsman highlights the importance of artistic skill and creativity in worship, as he was tasked with constructing the Tabernacle, a precursor to the Temple, which is a type of Christ as the dwelling place of God among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>son of Uri, the son of Hur</b><br>This genealogical detail connects Bezalel to a lineage of significance. Hur is believed to be the same individual who supported Moses' arms during the battle against Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10-12</a>), indicating a family legacy of faithfulness and leadership. This connection may also suggest a heritage of wisdom and strength, qualities necessary for the monumental task of building the Tabernacle.<p><b>of the tribe of Judah</b><br>The tribe of Judah holds a prominent place in biblical history, being the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-2</a>). Judah is often associated with leadership and kingship, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>.

God often arrests human focus before revealing His plans (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11&#8211;12</a>). By saying &#8220;See,&#8221; the Lord is underlining that what follows is His initiative, worthy of undivided notice, much like <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> when John the Baptist proclaims, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have called by name</b><p>The phrase reveals a personal, sovereign summons. God does not merely select a skill set; He calls a person (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>). In <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a> the Holy Spirit says, &#8220;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul,&#8221; echoing the same divine prerogative. The call is purposeful, specific, and non-negotiable&#8212;an encouraging reminder that service in God&#8217;s work is rooted in His authority, not human self-appointment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bezalel</b><p>Bezalel steps into history as the Spirit-filled artisan who will craft the tabernacle&#8217;s most sacred pieces (<a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3&#8211;5</a>; 35:30&#8211;33). His story underscores that artistry can be holy service. Like the craftsmen who later built Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13&#8211;14</a>), Bezalel shows that God supplies both the vision and the ability. Paul echoes this in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;7</a>: &#8220;There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>son of Uri</b><p>Mentioning &#8220;son of Uri&#8221; roots Bezalel in a real family line. Scripture often highlights lineage to affirm credibility and continuity (<a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>). God&#8217;s call respects generational context; He works through households, fulfilling promises that the light of His lamp would shine &#8220;upon my head&#8221; (<a href="/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>). The detail assures us that God cares about where we come from even as He directs where we are going.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Hur</b><p>Hur is remembered for supporting Moses&#8217; hands during Israel&#8217;s battle with Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10&#8211;12</a>) and for helping govern the people when Moses ascended Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>). By linking Bezalel to Hur, God highlights a lineage of faithfulness. <a href="/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a> affirms, &#8220;The generation of the upright will be blessed,&#8221; reminding us that steadfast obedience can ripple through descendants, positioning them for unique Kingdom assignments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the tribe of Judah</b><p>Judah is the royal tribe prophesied to carry the scepter until Shiloh comes (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). From this line would emerge David (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18&#8211;22</a>) and ultimately Jesus, &#8220;the Lion of the tribe of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). Choosing Bezalel from Judah ties craftsmanship to kingship: the tribe destined for leadership also produces servants who beautify worship. <a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2&#8211;3</a> traces this tribe&#8217;s significance straight into the New Testament, underscoring that God weaves every detail into His redemptive storyline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a> shows God personally drawing attention (&#8220;See&#8221;), exercising sovereign authority (&#8220;I have called by name&#8221;), valuing individual gifting (Bezalel), honoring family heritage (son of Uri, son of Hur), and aligning the work with His larger redemptive plan (tribe of Judah). The verse reminds us that divine calling is intentional, relational, and embedded in God&#8217;s unfolding purposes from generation to generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">I have called by name.</span>--It is a high honour to be called of God <span class= "ital">by name. </span>He thus calls only those whom He appoints to some great work, as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm" title="And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
