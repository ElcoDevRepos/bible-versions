This was a standard contribution required from each individual as part of the census tax. The beka was used in the context of the tabernacle service, emphasizing the communal responsibility of supporting the worship and maintenance of the sanctuary.<p><b>that is, half a shekel</b><br>The half shekel was a specific amount set by God for the census tax, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. This amount was significant because it was affordable for everyone, ensuring that all Israelites, regardless of wealth, contributed equally to the tabernacle. This reflects the principle of equality before God and the shared responsibility of the community.<p><b>according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard measure used in the tabernacle, ensuring consistency and fairness in contributions. This standardization highlights the importance of integrity and honesty in dealings related to worship and offerings. The sanctuary shekel was slightly heavier than the common shekel, underscoring the sacredness of the contributions.<p><b>from everyone twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was considered the age of maturity and responsibility in Israelite society. Those who were twenty and older were eligible for military service and were expected to contribute to the community's needs. This age requirement for the census tax underscores the role of adult males in the religious and civic life of Israel.<p><b>who had crossed over to be numbered</b><br>This phrase refers to the act of being counted in the census, which was a significant event for the Israelites. Crossing over to be numbered indicates a formal inclusion in the community of God's people. It also reflects the transition from the wilderness journey to becoming a structured nation under God's covenant.<p><b>a total of 603,550 men</b><br>This number represents the total count of Israelite men eligible for military service, excluding women, children, and the Levites. The large number signifies the growth of the Israelite nation since their descent into Egypt. It also foreshadows the military campaigns they would undertake in the conquest of Canaan. This census is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and the census.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who were counted in the census and contributed to the building of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites, constructed according to divine instructions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary_shekel.htm">Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>The standard unit of currency used in the sanctuary, which was used to measure the contributions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The counting of the Israelite men aged twenty and older, which was used to determine the amount of silver collected.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_contribution.htm">The Importance of Contribution</a></b><br>Each person was required to give a half-shekel, symbolizing equal responsibility and participation in the community of faith.

Back in <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a> the Lord had already commanded this very amount as the atonement money for every Israelite. There it served two purposes:<p>&#8226; It reminded each person that his life was ransomed by God, not by his own merit (<a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; It ensured that rich and poor stood on equal footing&#8212;no sliding scale, just the same small silver piece for all (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p>By repeating the figure here, the text ties the offering directly to the earlier decree and underlines that God&#8217;s instructions were carried out to the letter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Half a shekel according to the sanctuary shekel</b><p>The &#8220;sanctuary shekel&#8221; was the official standard kept at the tabernacle (<a href="/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>). By weighing every coin against that benchmark, the people guarded against inflation, counterfeits, or local variations. This underscores two truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8212;not culture&#8212;sets the measure of what is acceptable (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Accuracy in worship matters; shortcuts or substitutions are out of bounds (<a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13-14</a>).<p>Silver purchased the tabernacle&#8217;s bases and hooks (<a href="/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27-28</a>), so the very floor and connectors of God&#8217;s dwelling literally rested on the ransom paid by the people&#8212;a vivid pointer to the future redemption in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everyone twenty years of age or older</b><p>Twenty marked adulthood for Israel&#8217;s males, the age when a man could serve in the army (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>).

Each man literally &#8220;passed over&#8221; in front of Moses and Aaron to give his coin (<a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-14</a>). The phrase highlights:<p>&#8226; Personal involvement&#8212;no proxy payments, echoing <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, where every believer appears individually before Christ.<p>&#8226; Orderly administration&#8212;God cares about details as much as He cares about devotion (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A total of 603,550 men</b><p>This tally matches the earlier census (<a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a>; 2:32) and roughly fits the exodus headcount of &#8220;about six hundred thousand men on foot&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The consistency testifies to the historic reliability of Scripture. It also demonstrates:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness in multiplying Abraham&#8217;s descendants as promised (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The sheer logistical miracle of sustaining such a multitude in the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>).<p>In addition, every silver base under the tabernacle poles could be traced back to a specific man who had been counted, illustrating how individual obedience contributes to the stability of God&#8217;s house (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/38-26.htm">Exodus 38:26</a> captures more than a ledger entry. A single beka&#8212;half a shekel&#8212;paid by each adult male under the sanctuary standard speaks of equal ransom, precise obedience, individual accountability, and the collective strength of God&#8217;s redeemed people. The verse verifies God&#8217;s earlier commands, stresses His meticulous provision, and quietly foreshadows the perfect, once-for-all redemption later secured by Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">A bekah for every man.</span>--The word "bekah" means simply <span class= "ital">a half, </span>but appears to have been restricted in its use to the half-shekel.
