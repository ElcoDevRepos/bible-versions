The boundary signifies the holiness of God and the separation between the divine and the human. This boundary is a physical representation of the spiritual separation caused by sin. The mountain, identified as Mount Sinai, is traditionally located in the Sinai Peninsula, though its exact location is debated. The setting of boundaries is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's holiness and the need for reverence (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>).<p><b>and tell them, &#8216;Be careful not to go up on the mountain or touch its base.</b><br>This command underscores the seriousness of approaching God without proper mediation or preparation. The mountain is a sacred space, and touching it without permission is a violation of divine order. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for purity when approaching Him (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>). The warning to not even touch the base of the mountain highlights the absolute sanctity of God's presence.<p><b>Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.</b><br>The severe penalty for touching the mountain illustrates the gravity of disobedience and the holiness of God. This echoes the principle found throughout Scripture that the wages of sin is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The death penalty here is not just a legalistic measure but a theological statement about the consequences of sin and the need for atonement. This foreshadows the ultimate need for a mediator, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who bridges the gap between a holy God and sinful humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The holy mountain where God descended to give the Ten Commandments to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now at the foot of Mount Sinai.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_command.htm">God's Command</a></b><br>The directive given by God to Moses to set boundaries around Mount Sinai to maintain its sanctity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boundary.htm">The Boundary</a></b><br>A physical and spiritual demarcation set by God to protect the holiness of the mountain and the people from His consuming presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_holiness.htm">Reverence for God's Holiness</a></b><br>God's holiness demands respect and reverence.

The boundary around Sinai declares that access to God is precious, protected, and possible only on His terms&#8212;a lesson perfectly met in Jesus, who removes the fence for all who come to the Father through Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt set bounds.</span>--Here was another formal and mechanical direction, having for its object to deepen and intensify the lesson of God's unapproachable majesty and holiness. Moses was required to "set bounds to the people," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to make a substantial fence between the camp and the base of Sinai, which should prevent both animals and men from coming in contact with the mountain. Modern travellers generally observe how abruptly the rocky precipice of Ras Sufsafeh rises from the plain in front of it, so that in many places it is quite possible to stand on the plain and yet touch the mountain. The idea that <span class= "bld">a </span>line of natural mounds now to be seen near the base of Sinai represents the "bounds" of Moses (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine, </span>p. 43) is unsatisfactory, since the "bounds" of Moses were most certainly artificial ones. It is, however, possible that his "bounds" may have followed the line of the natural barrier.<p><span class= "bld">That ye go not up into the mount.</span>--Unless it had been forbidden, there might have seemed to be no reason why pious Israelites might not have ascended the height, to draw near to God in prayer. It is a praiseworthy feeling which breathes in the words, "Nearer, my God, to thee;" but the nation was not fit for close approach.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt set bounds</span>. The erection of a fence or barrier, between the camp and the mountain - not necessarily all round the mountain - seems to be meant. This barrier may have run along the line of low alluvial mounds at the foot of the cliff of Ras Sufsafeh, mentioned by Dean Stanley (Sinai and Palestine, p. 43), but cannot have been identical with them, since it was an artificial fence. <span class="cmt_word">That ye go not up into the mount</span>. Curiosity might have tempted some to ascend the mount, if it had not been positively forbidden under the penalty of death; carelessness might have brought many into contact with it, since the cliff rises abruptly from the plain. Unless the fence had been made, cattle would, naturally, have grazed along its base. To impress the Israelites with a due sense of the awful majesty of God, and the sacredness of everything material that it brought into close relations with him, the mount itself was declared holy - none but Moses and Aaron might go up into it; none might touch it; even the stray beast that approached it must suffer death for its unwitting offence (ver. 13<span class="cmt_word">). Whosoever toucheth the mount</span>. The mountain may be "touched" from the plain - it rises so abruptly. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be surely put to death</span>. A terrible punishment, and one which, to modern ideas, seems excessive. But it was only by terrible threats, and in some cases by terrible punishments (<a href="/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>), that the Israelites could be taught reverence. A profound reverence lies at the root of all true religious feeling; and for the education of the world, it was requisite, in the early ages, to inculcate the necessity of this frame of mind in some very marked and striking way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/19-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you are to set up a boundary</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7713;&#183;bal&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
