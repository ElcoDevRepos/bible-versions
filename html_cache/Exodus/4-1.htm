This moment occurs at the burning bush, a significant theophany where God reveals Himself to Moses. Moses' response indicates his hesitation and doubt, a common human reaction when faced with a daunting task. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God choosing imperfect individuals to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>&#8220;What if they do not believe me</b><br>Moses anticipates skepticism from the Israelites, reflecting a lack of confidence in his own authority and the message he is to deliver. This concern is rooted in his past experiences, as he had previously fled Egypt after killing an Egyptian (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11-15</a>). The question highlights the challenge of faith and belief, a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's messengers often face disbelief (e.g., the prophets, Jesus in His hometown in <a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>).<p><b>or listen to my voice?</b><br>Listening in biblical terms often implies obedience. Moses fears that the Israelites will neither heed his words nor follow his leadership. This concern is echoed throughout the Bible, where God's people frequently struggle to listen and obey His commands (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of not just hearing God's word but acting upon it.<p><b>For they may say,</b><br>Moses anticipates the objections of the Israelites, showing his awareness of their potential doubts. This reflects a broader biblical narrative where God's people often question His messengers (e.g., the Israelites questioning Moses and Aaron in <a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>). It also foreshadows the Israelites' frequent complaints and lack of faith during their wilderness journey.<p><b>&#8216;The LORD has not appeared to you.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a challenge to Moses' divine commission. The Israelites' potential disbelief in God's appearance to Moses highlights the need for signs and wonders to authenticate his mission, which God subsequently provides (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-9</a>). This skepticism parallels the New Testament, where Jesus' authority is questioned, and He performs miracles as signs of His divine mission (<a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>). Moses serves as a type of Christ, a mediator between God and His people, prefiguring Jesus' role as the ultimate mediator.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

The verse sets up God&#8217;s gracious response&#8212;signs that will validate His messenger&#8212;demonstrating that divine mission is sustained not by human confidence but by unmistakable acts of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Behold.</span>--Some render the word here used by "perhaps" (LXX., Aben-Ezra, Saadia, &c); but it does not appear to have anywhere this meaning. Moses meant to express a positive conviction that he would not be listened to. His faith was weak.<p><span class= "bld">They will say, The Lord hath not appeared.</span>--It is very probable that the people would have said this if Moses had not had any credentials to produce. It is even possible that they did say it. There had been no appearance of Jehovah to any one for above four hundred years, and they might well think that the age of miracles was past. Miracles cluster around certain crises in God's dealings with man, ceasing alto gether between one crisis and another. They were suspended for above 500 years between the time of Daniel and the appearance of the angel to Zacharias.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - The reluctance of Moses to undertake the part of leader, indicated by his first reply at his first calling, "Who am I that I should go?" etc. (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>), was not yet overcome. God had promised that he would succeed; but he did not see how he could succeed, either with the people or with Pharaoh. It was not enough for him that God had declared, "They (the people) shall hearken unto thy voice" (<span class="accented">ib.</span> 18); he does not, cannot believe this, and replies: "Behold, they will not believe, neither hearken unto my voice" (<a href="/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1</a>). This was plain want of faith; but not unnatural, and not, in God's sight, inexcusable. God therefore condescended to the human weakness of his servant, and proceeded to show him how he intended that he should persuade the people of his mission. He should persuade them by producing the credentials of miracles (vers. 2-9). But the laggard heart finds yet a further objection. Moses feels that he labours under a personal defect, which (he thinks) is an absolute disqualification. He is "slow of speech and of a slow tongue" (ver. 10), has always been wanting in eloquence, and does not find himself any the more eloquent since God has been speaking with him. In vain does Jehovah promise to "be with his mouth" (ver. 12); Moses' last word indicates all the old feeling of self-distrust. "Send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (ver. 13). Then at last the anger of the Lord is kindled against Moses, and God inflicts on him a sort of punishment - degrades him; as it were - deposes him from the position of sole leader, and associates Aaron with him in such sort that Aaron must have appeared, both to the Israelites and to the Pharaoh, as the chief leader rather than Moses. (See <a href="/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2, 10, 19</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-6.htm">Exodus 8:6, 17</a>, etc.) At this point the interview between Moses and Jehovah ends, and the action of the Exodus commences. Moses obtains leave to quit Midian, and quits it - retires to Egypt, after escaping from a dangerous sickness on the way (vers. 24-26), is met by Aaron and takes him into his counsels, summons the elders and exhibits before them his miraculous powers, persuades them, and is finally accepted as having, with Aaron, a mission from God, both by the elders and the people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they will not believe</span>. Attempts have been made to soften down this contradiction of God's words in <a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>, and to represent Moses as merely saying, "What if the people will not hearken, etc. What shall I do then?" (So the LXX., Geddes, Boothroyd, and others.) But the phrase is really emphatic and peremptory. As Rosenmuller says: "Vox est negantis et detrac-tantis officium." <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath not appeared to thee</span>. It is quite probable that the Israelites would have so spoken, if Moses had had no sign to show. There had been no appearance of Jehovah to anyone for above four hundred years. And the Israelites, who had not seen Moses for forty years, would not know whether he was a veracious person or not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
