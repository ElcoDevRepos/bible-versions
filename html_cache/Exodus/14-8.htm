The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in Exodus, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His purposes. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the heart was seen as the center of will and decision-making. The hardening signifies a divine judgment, allowing Pharaoh to act according to his own stubbornness, which ultimately leads to God's glory being displayed through the deliverance of Israel. This act also serves as a demonstration of God's power over the gods of Egypt, as Pharaoh was considered a deity himself.<p><b>so that he pursued the Israelites</b><br>Pharaoh's pursuit of the Israelites is a direct consequence of his hardened heart. Historically, the Egyptians had a powerful military, and their pursuit would have been a formidable threat to the fleeing Israelites. This pursuit sets the stage for the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, a pivotal event in Israel's history that is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a symbol of God's deliverance and faithfulness. The pursuit also highlights the tension between human free will and divine sovereignty, as Pharaoh's actions fulfill God's plan for Israel's liberation.<p><b>who were marching out defiantly</b><br>The Israelites' defiant march signifies their newfound freedom and confidence in God's deliverance. This defiance can be seen as an act of faith, trusting in God's promise to lead them to the Promised Land. Culturally, this defiance is significant as it represents a break from centuries of slavery and oppression in Egypt. The term "defiantly" suggests a boldness and courage that comes from their trust in God's protection. This moment foreshadows the future challenges and tests of faith the Israelites will face in the wilderness, as well as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who actively intervenes in the events of history to fulfill His purposes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh,_king_of_egypt.htm">Pharaoh, King of Egypt</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened by God, leading him to pursue the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now being led out by Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, representing a place of bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites leaving Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all events, including the hearts of rulers.
