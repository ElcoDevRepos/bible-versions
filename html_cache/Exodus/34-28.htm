The number forty is symbolic in the Bible, often associated with periods of testing, trial, and preparation. For example, the Israelites wandered in the desert for forty years (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>), and Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This time frame underscores the importance and solemnity of the covenant being established. It also emphasizes Moses' unique role as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<p><b>without eating bread or drinking water</b><br>Moses' fasting during this period is a supernatural event, as it is humanly impossible to survive without food and water for forty days. This miraculous fast signifies Moses' complete dependence on God and his total dedication to the divine mission. It also prefigures the fasting of Jesus, who similarly went without food for forty days and nights, highlighting a connection between Moses as a type of Christ, both serving as mediators of a covenant.<p><b>He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant</b><br>This phrase refers to the act of inscribing the Ten Commandments on stone tablets, which Moses did under God's direction. The tablets symbolize the permanence and unchanging nature of God's law. The covenant mentioned here is the Mosaic Covenant, a foundational aspect of Israel's identity and relationship with God. It established the terms by which the Israelites were to live as God's chosen people, setting them apart from other nations.<p><b>the Ten Commandments</b><br>The Ten Commandments are a central element of the Mosaic Law, serving as a moral and ethical foundation for the Israelites. They are divided into two sections: the first four commandments focus on the relationship between God and humanity, while the last six address interpersonal relationships. These commandments are reiterated in <a href="/deuteronomy/5.htm">Deuteronomy 5</a> and are foundational to Judeo-Christian ethics. They also foreshadow the teachings of Jesus, who summarized the law as love for God and love for neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).

The long time is, at first sight, surprising, since there were now no instructions to be given. But we learn from Deuteronomy (<a href="/context/exodus/9-18.htm" title="Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.">Exodus 9:18-19</a>) that it was required for an earnest and prolonged intercession by Moses on behalf of his nation, which ultimately prevailed with God, and induced Him to put away His "anger and hot displeasure."<p><span class= "bld">He did neither eat bread, nor drink water.</span>--A similar fast had been kept on the previous occasion (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm" title="When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. Fasts of this extraordinary duration are only recorded of Moses, of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm" title="And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.">1Kings 19:8</a>), and of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm" title="And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.">Matthew 4:2</a>).

As on the former occasion (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). The patience and faith of the people was tested by this second long delay. Happily, they stood the test; and on Moses' final descent from Sinai the Israelites were found expectant and obedient (vers. 30-32). <span class="cmt_word">He did neither eat bread nor drink water</span>. This was so also on the former occasion (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. The near presence of God sustained the vital powers and made food unnecessary. Moses, Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and our Lord have alone accomplished a fast of this duration. Modern parodies are not held by scientific men to belong to the category of established facts. <span class="cmt_word">He wrote upon the tables</span>. It has been argued from this expression that Moses wrote the words on the second tables; and it would be natural so to understand the passage, had nothing else been said on the subject. But in ver. 1 we are told that "God said, I will write upon these tables;" and the same is repeated in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>. Moreover in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>, it is distinctly declared "He" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) "wrote on the tables according to the first writing."
