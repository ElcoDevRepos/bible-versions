The design of the lampstand, with its branches, is reminiscent of a tree, possibly symbolizing the Tree of Life from Genesis. The number six, representing the branches, is often associated with humanity, as man was created on the sixth day. The lampstand itself, made of pure gold, signifies purity and divinity, pointing to the holiness required to approach God. The branches extending from the central shaft can be seen as a representation of the unity and diversity within the body of believers, with Christ as the central vine (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><b>three on one side and three on the other.</b><br>The symmetry of the lampstand, with three branches on each side, emphasizes balance and order, reflecting God's nature as a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). The number three is often associated with divine completeness and perfection, seen in the Trinity. This design may also foreshadow the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The lampstand's structure, with its central shaft and branches, can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and the source from which all spiritual life and light emanate. The menorah's light was to burn continually, symbolizing the perpetual presence and guidance of God, much like the eternal light of Christ in the lives of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the Tabernacle, including the design of the lampstand, directly from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God communicated with Moses and provided the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lampstand.htm">The Lampstand (Menorah)</a></b><br>A sacred object within the Tabernacle, symbolizing the light of God and His presence among His people.

Nothing was left to human improvisation; obedience meant crafting all six.<p>- These extensions allowed additional lamps, ensuring fuller light inside the Holy Place (<a href="/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>; 27:20&#8211;21). In the same way, Jesus calls His people to &#8220;let your light shine before men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>), reflecting the original, God-given source.<p>- The number &#8220;six&#8221; points to man&#8217;s work within God&#8217;s plan&#8212;created on the sixth day (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26&#8211;31</a>) and reliant on divine provision for true illumination (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the sides of the lampstand</b><p>- The branches did not stand alone; they rose out of the central shaft. Connection kept every lamp supplied by the same reservoir of pure oil (<a href="/leviticus/24-1.htm">Leviticus 24:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>- This pictures the unity of God&#8217;s people drawing life from one root, as Jesus teaches, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>- Orientation &#8220;from the sides&#8221; maintained balance and symmetry, mirroring the orderly character of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>- The construction was hammered from one piece of gold (<a href="/exodus/25-36.htm">Exodus 25:36</a>), showcasing strength through unity&#8212;no weak joints, no mixed metals (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three on one side</b><p>- The first trio of branches symbolically covers half the lampstand&#8217;s outreach.
