His role was to communicate God's will and instructions, as seen throughout the Exodus narrative. This phrase indicates Moses is continuing a message from God, emphasizing his role as a spokesperson.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening</b><br>This promise of meat refers to the quail that God provided for the Israelites. Quail migration patterns in the Sinai Peninsula make this provision plausible, as large flocks would land exhausted after crossing the Mediterranean. This event demonstrates God's ability to provide miraculously and His responsiveness to the needs of His people, despite their complaints.<p><b>and bread to fill you in the morning,</b><br>The bread refers to manna, a miraculous food that appeared each morning. Manna is described as small, round, and white, tasting like wafers made with honey. This daily provision required the Israelites to trust God for their sustenance, teaching reliance on Him. Manna is a type of Christ, the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>), symbolizing spiritual nourishment.<p><b>for He has heard your grumbling against Him.</b><br>The Israelites' grumbling reflects a lack of faith and gratitude, despite witnessing God's power in the plagues and the Red Sea crossing. This grumbling is a recurring theme in the wilderness journey, highlighting human nature's tendency to doubt and complain. God's response shows His patience and mercy, yet also sets the stage for future discipline due to continued unbelief.<p><b>Who are we?</b><br>Moses and Aaron, as leaders, deflect the focus from themselves to God. This rhetorical question emphasizes that they are merely servants of God, not the source of the Israelites' provision or the target of their complaints. It underscores the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and authority.<p><b>Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This statement clarifies that the Israelites' complaints, though directed at Moses and Aaron, are ultimately against God. It serves as a warning about the seriousness of grumbling against divine provision and leadership. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to do all things without grumbling (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a>), recognizing that discontentment is ultimately directed at God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
