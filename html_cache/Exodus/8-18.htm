These magicians had previously replicated some of the earlier signs, such as turning staffs into serpents and water into blood, using their secret arts. This phrase highlights the limitations of human and demonic power when confronted with the divine power of God. The inability of the magicians to replicate this plague signifies a turning point, demonstrating that the power of God surpasses all earthly and spiritual forces. This event foreshadows the ultimate defeat of evil powers, as seen in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ triumphs over sin and death.<p><b>but they could not</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the sovereignty and supremacy of God over all creation. The magicians' failure to produce gnats marks the first time they are unable to mimic a plague, indicating that God's power is unmatched. This inability serves as a testament to the authenticity of Moses and Aaron as God's chosen messengers. It also prefigures the ultimate victory of God over false gods and idols, as seen throughout the Bible, including the defeat of Baal's prophets by Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>. The phrase underscores the futility of relying on human wisdom and power in opposition to God's will.<p><b>And the gnats remained on man and beast</b><br>The presence of gnats on both humans and animals signifies the pervasive nature of this plague, affecting all aspects of Egyptian life. This infestation would have caused significant discomfort and disruption, highlighting the severity of God's judgment. The mention of both man and beast reflects the comprehensive impact of sin and the need for divine intervention. This phrase can be seen as a type of the pervasive nature of sin, which affects all of creation, and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ, who restores and reconciles all things to God. The gnats' persistence serves as a reminder of the consequences of hardening one's heart against God's commands, as Pharaoh did.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
