The prohibition against touching signifies the separation between the divine and the profane. In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical contact with sacred objects or places was often restricted to prevent defilement. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for purity when approaching Him.<p><b>but he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows</b><br>The prescribed methods of execution&#8212;stoning or shooting with arrows&#8212;indicate the seriousness of the offense. Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Israel, often used for severe transgressions against God's law. The use of arrows suggests a need to maintain distance, reinforcing the idea that the mountain is a holy place that must not be defiled by human touch.<p><b>whether man or beast, he must not live.</b><br>This clause underscores the absolute nature of the command. Both humans and animals are subject to the same penalty, highlighting the comprehensive scope of God's holiness. The inclusion of animals suggests that the sanctity of the mountain is so great that even unintentional breaches by creatures are intolerable. This reflects the broader biblical principle that all creation is accountable to God's standards.<p><b>Only when the ram&#8217;s horn sounds a long blast</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, is a significant instrument in biblical tradition, often used to signal important events or divine interventions. The long blast serves as a divine signal that the people may approach, indicating a temporary suspension of the prohibition. This use of the shofar connects to other biblical instances where it marks moments of revelation or judgment, such as the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>).<p><b>may they approach the mountain.</b><br>The permission to approach the mountain is conditional and time-bound, emphasizing the need for obedience to God's instructions. This approach is not casual but is a divinely orchestrated event, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The mountain, as the site of divine revelation, foreshadows other significant biblical mountains, such as Mount Zion, and ultimately points to the access to God made possible through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Law to Moses and the Israelites.

To stop him and seize him, another person must have transgressed the bounds, and so have repeated the act which was forbidden.

Instead of seizing him, they were to kill him with stones or arrows from within the "bounds," and the same was to be done, if any stray beast approached the mountain. <span class="cmt_word">When the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount</span>. By translating the same Hebrew phrase differently here and in verse 12, the A. V. avoids the difficulty which most commentators see in this passage. According to the apparent construction, the people are first told that they may, on no account, ascend the mountain (ver. ,12), and then that they may do so, so soon as the trumpet sounds long (ver. 13). But they do not ascend at that time (ver. 19), nor are they allowed to do so - on the contrary, Moses is charged anew to prevent it (ver. 21-25); nor indeed do <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">people</span> ever ascend, but only Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy eiders (<a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1, 2</a>). What, then, is the permission here given? When we scrutinise the passage closely, we observe that the pronoun "they" is in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">emphatic</span>, and, therefore, unlikely to refer to "the people" of ver. 12. To whom then does it refer? Not, certainly, to "the Elders" of ver. 7, which would be too remote an antecedent, but to those chosen persons who are in the writer's mind, whom God was about to allow to ascend. Even these were not allowed to go up until summoned by the prolonged blast of the trumpet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/19-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb -
