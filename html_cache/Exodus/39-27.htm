The priesthood was established by God to serve as mediators between Him and the people. Aaron, as the first high priest, and his sons, who would follow in his footsteps, were set apart for this sacred duty. This lineage is significant as it underscores the hereditary nature of the priesthood in Israel, which was a divine appointment rather than a human decision. The priesthood of Aaron is a type of the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>.<p><b>they made tunics of fine linen</b><br>The tunics were garments made specifically for the priests, crafted from fine linen. Linen was a symbol of purity and righteousness, which is fitting for those who served in the presence of God. The use of fine linen also indicates the importance and sacredness of the priestly role. In the ancient Near East, linen was a valuable material, often associated with wealth and status, but in the context of the priesthood, it symbolized holiness and separation unto God. The tunics can be seen as a foreshadowing of the righteousness of Christ, which clothes believers, as mentioned in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.<p><b>the work of a weaver</b><br>This phrase highlights the craftsmanship and skill involved in creating the priestly garments. The work of a weaver implies a level of artistry and precision, reflecting the care and attention to detail that God required for those who served Him. The weaver's work signifies the intricate and intentional design of God's plan for His people, much like the detailed instructions given for the construction of the Tabernacle. This craftsmanship can be seen as a metaphor for the divine workmanship in believers, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are referred to as God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
