It was used by the priests for ceremonial washing before they performed their duties, symbolizing purification and the need for holiness when approaching God. The use of bronze, a durable and reflective material, signifies judgment and strength. The basin's construction follows the detailed instructions given to Moses on Mount Sinai, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands in worship practices.<p><b>from the mirrors of the women</b><br>The mirrors mentioned here were likely made of polished bronze, as glass mirrors were not common in the ancient Near East. These mirrors were personal items, indicating a significant sacrifice by the women who donated them. This act of giving up personal possessions for the service of God reflects a heart of devotion and willingness to contribute to the communal worship life of Israel. It also highlights the role of women in the religious life of the community, showing their active participation and dedication.<p><b>who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting were likely involved in some form of ministry or service, although the exact nature of their duties is not specified. Their presence at the entrance suggests a role in maintaining the sanctity and order of the worship space. This service can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of the priesthood of all believers, where both men and women are called to serve God.

Bronze was the metal ordinarily employed for the purpose, and was in common use in Egypt, where mirrors were bronze plates, round or oval, with a handle, like our fire-screens. The Etruscan women employed similar articles in their toilets, and had them often delicately chased with engravings.<p><span class= "bld">Of the women assembling.</span>--It would seem that these women--the women wont to frequent the "tent of meeting" which Moses had recently set up (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7</a>), and to flock thither in troops--offered voluntarily for the service of God the mirrors, which were among the most highly prized of their possessions. Moses, to mark his approval of their devotion, formed their offerings into the most honourable of all the brazen vessels, and recorded the fact to the women's credit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the looking-glasses of the women</span>. This interesting fact has not been previously mentioned. Bronze plates, circular or oval, admitting of a high polish, were used by the Egyptian women as mirrors from a very early date, and may be seen in the Egyptian collection of the British Museum. They have handles like those of our fire-screens, generally also of bronze. It was natural that the Hebrew women should possess similar articles, and should have taken care to bring them with them out of Egypt. The sacrifice of them for a sacred purpose is rather to be ascribed to their own serf-denying piety than to any command issued by Moses (Spencer). <span class="cmt_word">Which assembled</span>. Literally, "who came by troops." Women assembled themselves by troops at the entrance of the "tent of meeting" set up lay. Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>), as at a later date we find Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9-12</a>) and other women who were less worthy (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>) doing. The women who showed this zeal were those that made the sacrifice of their mirrors for God's service. There is no reason to suppose (with Hengstenberg and others) that they constituted a regular "order." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/38-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next, he made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
