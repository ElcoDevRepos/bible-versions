In the context of Exodus, God is preparing Moses for his mission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. This direct speech underscores the personal relationship between God and His chosen leaders, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, such as with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and later with the prophets.<p><b>If they refuse to believe you</b><br>Here, God anticipates the skepticism of the Israelites. This reflects a common biblical theme where God's messengers often face doubt and disbelief, as seen with prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-8</a>). It also foreshadows the disbelief Jesus would encounter (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>). The conditional "if" suggests God's awareness of human free will and the potential for resistance to divine messages.<p><b>or heed the witness of the first sign</b><br>The "first sign" refers to the miraculous transformation of Moses' staff into a serpent (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>). Signs and wonders are a recurring method God uses to authenticate His messengers and messages, as seen with Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). This sign serves as a tangible demonstration of God's power, intended to validate Moses' divine commission.<p><b>they may believe that of the second</b><br>The "second sign" involves Moses' hand becoming leprous and then being healed (<a href="/exodus/4-6.htm">Exodus 4:6-7</a>). This sign not only demonstrates God's power over health and disease but also symbolizes purification and restoration, themes central to the biblical narrative of redemption. The progression from one sign to another indicates God's patience and willingness to provide multiple evidences of His power and presence, similar to how Jesus performed various miracles to reveal His identity (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

(Comp. <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm" title="They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.">Psalm 105:27</a>, where Moses and Aaron are said to have proclaimed "the <span class= "ital">words </span>of God's signs.")

They were then to be shown the second, which would be much more astonishing to them, having no parallel in their experience. This would persuade the greater number. As some, however, might still doubt, a third sign was provided. God is patient with all reasonable doubt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the first sign</span>. Some understand "the voice of Moses as he gave them the first sign;" but it is better to regard the sign itself as speaking to them. According to the sacred writers everything that can teach us anything - day, night, the heavens, the firmament, the beasts, the fowls of the air, the fishes, nay, the very stones - have a voice. They teach us, speak to us, declare to us, cry out aloud, lift up their voice, shout, sing, proclaim God's will, whether man will hear or whether he will forbear. (See <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-3</a>; <a href="/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7, 3</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>; <a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>, etc.) Equally, or rather much more, must a miracle be regarded as having a voice.
