Moses is often seen as a mediator between God and the Israelites, a role that foreshadows Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The divine initiative here underscores God's sovereignty and His desire to establish a covenant with His people.<p><b>Come up to Me on the mountain and stay here</b><br>Mount Sinai, also known as Horeb, is a significant location in biblical history, representing a place of divine revelation. The mountain is a symbol of God's holiness and transcendence. Moses' ascent signifies a call to holiness and separation, paralleling the believer's call to draw near to God (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). The command to "stay here" suggests a period of waiting and preparation, reflecting the importance of patience and obedience in receiving God's word.<p><b>so that I may give you the tablets of stone</b><br>The tablets of stone are a tangible representation of God's covenant with Israel, containing the Ten Commandments. This act of giving the law on stone signifies permanence and divine authority. The use of stone tablets also connects to ancient Near Eastern practices where important decrees were inscribed on durable materials. This foreshadows the new covenant, where God's laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>with the law and commandments I have written</b><br>God Himself is the author of the law, highlighting its divine origin and authority. The law and commandments serve as a moral and ethical guide for the Israelites, setting them apart as God's chosen people. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's word as a source of life and guidance (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). The writing by God's hand underscores the personal nature of His covenant with His people.<p><b>for their instruction</b><br>The purpose of the law is instructional, meant to teach the Israelites how to live in a way that pleases God. It serves as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), revealing humanity's need for a Savior. The law's role in instruction is foundational for understanding God's character and His expectations for His people, pointing ultimately to the fulfillment of the law in Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who calls Moses to receive His law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to mediate His covenant and receive His commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The holy mountain where God reveals His law to Moses, symbolizing divine authority and presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tablets_of_stone.htm">Tablets of Stone</a></b><br>The physical manifestation of God's law, representing His covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_and_commandments.htm">The Law and Commandments</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to guide the moral and spiritual life of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_invitation.htm">Divine Invitation</a></b><br>God invites us into His presence to receive His guidance and instruction, just as He called Moses to the mountain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_law.htm">The Importance of God's Law</a></b><br>The law given to Moses is foundational for understanding God's holiness and our need for a Savior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_relationship.htm">Obedience and Relationship</a></b><br>Our relationship with God is deepened through obedience to His commandments, which are given for our instruction and well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_in_christ.htm">The Fulfillment in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus fulfills the law, and through Him, we receive the grace to live according to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/internalization_of_god's_word.htm">Internalization of God's Word</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to internalize God's commandments, allowing the Holy Spirit to write them on our hearts.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_24_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 24:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_24_12_God_s_law_s_daily_role.htm">How does Exodus 24:12 emphasize the importance of God's law for daily life?

But "<span class= "ital">quid prosunt leges sine moribus</span>?" It was necessary for the sustentation of the religious life of the people that a sacred polity should be instituted, a form of worship set up, and regulations established with regard to all the externals of religion--holy persons, holy places, rites, ceremonies, vestments, incense, consecration. Moses was directed to ascend into the mount, and hold prolonged communion with God, in order that he might learn the mind of God with respect to all these things. His prolonged stay for "forty days and forty nights" (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>) was necessary to give him a full and complete knowledge of all the details so elaborately set forth in Exodus 25-30, and again in Exodus 35-40, which thenceforth constituted the essentials of the external worship of Israel, whereby the minds and habits of the people were moulded and impressed in a far more efficacious way than could ever have been done by a mere set of abstract propositions, appealing only to the intellect. "<span class= "ital">Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures, Quam qu? sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus." </span>The Decalogue and the Book of the Covenant had no doubt a considerable share in forming the character of the Hebrew nation; but a larger share must be assigned to the ritual and ceremonial which Moses was now instructed to set up, and which forms the main subject of the remainder of the Book.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Come up to me into the mount, and be there.</span>--After the sacrificial meal, the seventy-four persons engaged in it had descended into the plain of Er-Rahah, and possibly spent some time there, before a second summons came to Moses. This time he was directed to ascend accompanied only by his minister, Joshua (<a href="/exodus/24-13.htm" title="And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.">Exodus 24:13</a>), and was warned that his stay was to be a prolonged one in the words, "And <span class= "ital">be there."</span><p><span class= "bld">And I will give thee tables of stone . . . --</span>It is remarkable that these are not expressly said, either here or in <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>, to have contained the ten commandments.

And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>; and with respect to the second tables, the same is affirmed in <a href="/exodus/34-28.htm" title="And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.">Exodus 34:28</a>. The fiction of a double decalogue is thus precluded. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - MOSES' ENTRY INTO THE CLOUD, AND FORTY DAYS' COMMUNE WITH GOD. It was necessary now that Moses should receive full directions for the external worship of God, the sanctuary, and the priesthood. Every religion has something tangible and material about it - holy places, holy things, rites, ceremonies, rules, forms, regulations. If man sets himself to devise these things of his own head, he may very easily go wrong, and find his elaborate inventions "an offence" to God. To avoid this - to secure the result that all should be pleasing and acceptable to "the High and Holy One which inhabiteth eternity," it was thought fitting that "patterns" should be shown to Moses of all that was to be made for the worship (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>), and exact details given him with respect to the material, size, shape, and construction of each. The results are put before us in seven chapters (chs. 25-31.). For the purpose of allowing ample time for the communications which had to be made and of securing that undivided attention which was requisite in order that all should remain fixed in the memory, God summoned his servant to a long and solitary colloquy, on the mountain summit whereon the cloud rested (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), apart from all his people. Moses, of course, obeyed; but before ascending, arranged with the elders that in his absence Aaron and Hur should have the direction of affairs, and decide all doubtful questions (ver. 14). He then went up the mountain, accompanied for part of the way by Joshua, who is now spoken of as his "minister," or "attendant" (ver. 13). Joshua probably remained with him for six days, while Moses waited for a summons to enter the cloud. On the seventh day the summons came: and Moses, leaving Joshua, entered the cloud, and was hid from the sight of all men. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come up to me</span>. Moses, apparently, had descended again into the plain, with Aaron and the seventy elders, after the festival was over. (See ver. 14, and compare <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>.) He is now commanded to reascend, <span class="cmt_word">and be</span> <span class="cmt_word">there</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "And continue there" - foreshadowing the length of the stay. <span class="cmt_word">Tables of stone, and a law, and commandments</span>, etc. Literally, "Tables of stone, and <span class="accented">the</span> law and the commandments which I have written." The three expressions alike refer to the Decalogue, which alone God <span class="accented">wrote</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest teach them</span>. Rather," to teach them." God wrote the commandments on stone, in order to inculcate them with the greater force upon his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/24-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
