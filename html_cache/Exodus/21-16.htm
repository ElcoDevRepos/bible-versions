In the ancient Near Eastern context, kidnapping was a serious crime, often associated with slavery or forced servitude. The biblical law here reflects the high value placed on human life and freedom, aligning with the broader biblical principle that every person is made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). This commandment underscores the sanctity of human life and the importance of protecting individuals from exploitation and harm.<p><b>must be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment of death for kidnapping highlights the gravity of the offense. In the context of the Mosaic Law, capital punishment was reserved for the most serious crimes, indicating that kidnapping was seen as a direct attack on the social order and the well-being of the community. This reflects the principle of justice and retribution found throughout the Old Testament, where the punishment is meant to fit the crime (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). The severity of the penalty serves as a deterrent and underscores the importance of upholding justice and protecting the vulnerable.<p><b>whether he sells him</b><br>This clause addresses the potential outcome of kidnapping, where the victim is sold into slavery. The selling of a kidnapped person into slavery was a common practice in the ancient world, and this law explicitly condemns it. The prohibition against selling a kidnapped person aligns with the broader biblical condemnation of unjust slavery and human trafficking. It reflects the biblical theme of liberation and freedom, as seen in the Exodus narrative, where God delivers the Israelites from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p><b>or the man is found in his possession</b><br>This phrase indicates that the crime of kidnapping is punishable regardless of whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper's possession. The law ensures that the perpetrator is held accountable in all circumstances, emphasizing the protection of the victim's rights and dignity. This comprehensive approach to justice is consistent with the biblical emphasis on righteousness and the protection of the innocent. It also reflects the principle that intent and action are both subject to divine and legal scrutiny, as seen in other biblical laws that address both the act and the intent behind it (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Exodus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law, who were being formed into a covenant community under God's guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the law to Moses, including the commandments and ordinances.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kidnapper.htm">Kidnapper</a></b><br>The individual who unlawfully takes another person, as described in this law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/victim.htm">Victim</a></b><br>The person who is kidnapped, highlighting the crime's severity and the need for justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_human_life.htm">The Sanctity of Human Life</a></b><br>This law underscores the value God places on human life and personal freedom.

Because each person bears God&#8217;s image, stealing a life is an offense so grave that only death satisfies divine justice. Whether the kidnapper aims to sell the victim or merely keep him, the law makes no distinction&#8212;the perpetrator forfeits his own life. The verse affirms the sanctity of human freedom, the equality of all before God&#8217;s law, and the seriousness with which the Lord defends the vulnerable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that stealeth a man</span>. Kidnapping, or stealing men to make them slaves, was a very early and very wide-spread crime. Joseph' s brothers must be regarded as having committed it (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>); and there are many traces of it in the remains of antiquity. (See Herod. 4:183; Strab. 7. p. 467; Sueton. <span class="accented">Octav</span>. &sect; 32; etc.) Most kidnapping was of foreigners; and this was a practice of which the laws of states took no cognizance, though a certain disrepute may have attached to it. But the kidnapping of a fellow-country-man was generally punished with severity. At Athens it was a capital offence. At Rome it made a man infamous. We may gather from <a href="/deuteronomy/24-7.htm">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>, that the Mosaic law was especially levelled against this lena of the crime, though the words of the present passage are general, and forbid the crime altogether. Man-stealing, in the general sense, is now regarded as an offence by the chief civilised states of Europe and America, and is punished by confiscation of the stolen goods, and sometimes by imprisonment of the man-stealers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whoever kidnaps</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;n&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1589.htm">Strong's 1589: </a> </span><span class="str2">To thieve, to deceive</span><br /><br /><span class="word">another man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">must be put to death,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whether he sells him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4376.htm">Strong's 4376: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sell</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or the man is found</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nim&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his possession.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/21-16.htm">OT Law: Exodus 21:16 Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him (Exo.
