The altar, central to Israelite worship, represents a place of sacrifice and communion with God. This command for regular offerings underscores the need for consistent devotion and obedience. The practice of daily offerings is a reminder of God's constant presence and the need for ongoing atonement and fellowship with Him. This concept of regularity in worship is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to pray without ceasing (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>).<p><b>each day:</b><br>The daily nature of the offering highlights the perpetual need for atonement and the Israelites' dependence on God's mercy. It reflects the rhythm of life centered around worship and obedience. This daily practice can be seen as a precursor to the Christian discipline of daily prayer and devotion, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a continual relationship with God. The daily offerings also foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides eternal atonement for sin.<p><b>two lambs that are a year old.</b><br>The use of lambs in the offering is significant, as lambs are often associated with innocence and purity. A year-old lamb is in its prime, symbolizing the best and most valuable offering to God. This requirement points to the necessity of giving God our best in worship and sacrifice. The lamb is a type of Christ, the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), who was without blemish and offered Himself for the sins of the world. The dual offering of two lambs each day may also symbolize completeness and the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, which covers all sin for all time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions from God on Mount Sinai regarding the consecration of the priests and the offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, who were to carry out the sacrificial offerings as part of their priestly duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The place of sacrifice in the Tabernacle where the daily offerings were to be made, symbolizing the presence of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daily_sacrifice.htm">The Daily Sacrifice</a></b><br>The continual offering of two lambs each day, one in the morning and one at twilight, as a perpetual reminder of God's covenant and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_regular_worship.htm">The Importance of Regular Worship</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were commanded to offer sacrifices daily, Christians are called to engage in regular worship and devotion to God.

At the same time incense was to be burnt upon the golden altar before the vail, as a figure of the perpetual prayer that it behoved the nation to send up to the Throne of Grace for a continuance of the Divine favour.
