The act of bringing them forward signifies their selection and calling by God for a special purpose. In the broader context of Exodus, this is part of the establishment of the Levitical priesthood, which plays a crucial role in the religious life of Israel. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>. The act of bringing forward also symbolizes the presentation of individuals before God, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present themselves as living sacrifices.<p><b>and clothe them with tunics</b><br>Clothing the sons of Aaron with tunics is a significant act of consecration and preparation for their priestly duties. The tunics were part of the sacred garments described in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, designed for glory and beauty, signifying the holiness and dignity required of those who serve in God's presence. This act of clothing is symbolic of being covered in righteousness, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where God clothes His people with garments of salvation. The tunics also serve as a reminder of the need for purity and sanctity in service to God, paralleling the New Testament call for believers to "put on the new self" (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>), created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.
