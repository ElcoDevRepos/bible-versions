The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, his wife after Sarah's death. This connection to Abraham places Reuel within the broader narrative of God's covenant people. The daughters' return to Reuel signifies a familial and cultural structure where daughters were under the authority and protection of their father. This reflects the patriarchal society of the time, where family lineage and leadership were significant.<p><b>he asked them,</b><br>Reuel's inquiry indicates a level of concern and involvement in his daughters' daily activities. It suggests a familial relationship where communication and accountability are valued. This interaction also sets the stage for Moses' introduction to Reuel's family, which will have significant implications for Moses' future.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you returned so early today?&#8221;</b><br>The question implies that the daughters' early return was unusual, suggesting that their daily tasks, likely related to shepherding, typically took longer. This early return is due to Moses' intervention, where he helped them water their flock.
