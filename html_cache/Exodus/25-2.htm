The Israelites, having recently been delivered from Egypt, are now being asked to contribute to the construction of a sacred space where God will dwell among them. This offering is not just a material contribution but a spiritual act of worship and obedience. The concept of offerings is deeply rooted in the ancient Near Eastern culture, where offerings were made to deities as acts of devotion and appeasement. In the biblical context, offerings are a way for the Israelites to acknowledge God's sovereignty and express gratitude for His deliverance and provision.<p><b>You are to receive My offering from every man whose heart compels him.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the voluntary nature of the offering. Unlike other ancient cultures where offerings might be demanded or coerced, God desires offerings that come from a willing heart. This reflects the principle that true worship and service to God must be motivated by love and devotion, not obligation. The phrase "whose heart compels him" suggests an internal prompting, aligning with the biblical theme that God values the heart's intention over mere external compliance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This voluntary giving foreshadows the New Testament teaching on cheerful giving (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). It also points to the nature of Christ's sacrifice, which was given willingly and out of love for humanity (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive His laws and instructions, including the building of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that God instructed the Israelites to build as a place of worship and His dwelling among them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and is now giving them instructions for worship and community life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offering.htm">The Offering</a></b><br>A voluntary contribution from the Israelites, consisting of materials needed for the construction of the Tabernacle, given by those whose hearts are moved to give.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/voluntary_giving.htm">Voluntary Giving</a></b><br>God desires offerings that come from a willing heart, not out of compulsion.
