The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It was a central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence with His people. The bull, a significant and valuable animal, represents a sin offering, indicating the seriousness of the atonement process. The presentation at the front of the Tent signifies the offering being made directly before God, emphasizing the need for purity and holiness in approaching Him.<p><b>and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head</b><br>The act of laying hands on the bull's head is a symbolic gesture of identification and transference. Aaron and his sons, who are being consecrated as priests, are identifying with the bull, transferring their sins and the sins of the people onto the animal. This act signifies substitutionary atonement, where the bull takes on the penalty of sin on behalf of the people. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself the sins of humanity. The laying on of hands is a recurring biblical theme, seen in other contexts such as the ordination of leaders and the healing of the sick, symbolizing the impartation of blessing, authority, or responsibility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
