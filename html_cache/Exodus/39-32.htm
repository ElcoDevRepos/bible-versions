The tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting, served as the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The completion signifies obedience and dedication to God's commands, reflecting the importance of following divine instructions precisely. The tabernacle's construction involved skilled artisans and the use of precious materials, symbolizing the value and holiness of God's dwelling place. This completion also prefigures the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity through Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the faithfulness and obedience of the Israelites in executing God's commands. It highlights the importance of adhering to divine instructions without deviation, a theme prevalent throughout the Pentateuch. The Israelites' obedience here contrasts with their earlier disobedience, such as the incident with the golden calf (Exodus 32). This obedience is a model for believers, illustrating the blessings and presence of God that follow when His people live according to His will. The phrase also underscores Moses' role as a faithful mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who perfectly fulfills the Father's will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and tasked with constructing the tabernacle according to God's instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the commandments and instructions from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God would dwell among His people, serving as a central place of worship and sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Another term for the tabernacle, emphasizing its role as a place where God would meet with Moses and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who provided the detailed instructions for the construction of the tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' completion of the tabernacle as commanded by God underscores the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_among_his_people.htm">God's Presence Among His People</a></b><br>The tabernacle symbolizes God's desire to dwell among His people, reminding us of His continual presence in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_worship.htm">Attention to Detail in Worship</a></b><br>The meticulous construction of the tabernacle teaches us to approach worship with reverence and care, honoring God with our best.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_in_action.htm">Community in Action</a></b><br>The collective effort of the Israelites in building the tabernacle highlights the importance of community and cooperation in fulfilling God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_of_christ.htm">Foreshadowing of Christ</a></b><br>The tabernacle points to Jesus, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with humanity, encouraging us to seek a deeper relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_39_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 39:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_39_32_Obedience_to_God_s_plan.htm">How does Exodus 39:32 demonstrate obedience to God's detailed instructions for the Tabernacle?

Just as creation was finished on the sixth day (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-3</a>), the Tabernacle&#8212;a microcosm of God&#8217;s ordered world&#8212;now stands ready for His presence.<p>- Completion means readiness for divine fellowship: &#8220;There I will meet with the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43</a>). Until everything was finished, God&#8217;s glory could not fill the sanctuary (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>).<p>- The title &#8220;Tent of Meeting&#8221; reminds us that the project&#8217;s purpose is not aesthetic but relational. Every board, curtain, and clasp points to a God who desires to dwell among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><p>- Obedience is highlighted eight times in this chapter (e.g., <a href="/exodus/39-1.htm">Exodus 39:1, 5, 7</a>). Repetition drives home that the people followed the exact pattern revealed on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>).<p>- Their obedience is comprehensive&#8212;covering craftsmanship (<a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>), sacrificial offerings (<a href="/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-31</a>), and even the garments &#8220;woven with skill&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/28-3.htm">Exodus 28:3</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s commands came through Moses; the people&#8217;s willingness to submit to that leadership models healthy spiritual order (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>- This verse anticipates the divine inspection: &#8220;Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded&#8212;so Moses blessed them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-43.htm">Exodus 39:43</a>). Obedience brings blessing and the assurance of God&#8217;s approval.<p>- The phrase &#8220;did everything&#8221; sets a benchmark that later generations too often failed to meet (<a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-12</a>). Here, however, the nation shines in wholehearted compliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32</a> celebrates a finished sanctuary and a faithful people.
