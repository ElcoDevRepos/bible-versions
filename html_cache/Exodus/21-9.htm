This reflects the patriarchal structure of the time, where family heads made significant decisions. The choice of a servant for a son indicates a blending of social classes, which was not uncommon in biblical times. This provision ensures that the servant is treated with dignity and respect, highlighting the importance of family integrity and social justice within the Mosaic Law.<p><b>he must deal with her as with a daughter</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the requirement for the father to treat the servant with the same care and respect as he would his own daughter. It underscores the biblical principle of equality and protection for those in vulnerable positions. This provision ensures that the woman is not merely seen as property but as a valued member of the family. The treatment as a daughter implies full integration into the family, with rights and privileges, reflecting God's concern for justice and compassion. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching of believers being adopted as sons and daughters of God, highlighting the theme of inclusion and familial love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant_girl.htm">Hebrew Servant Girl</a></b><br>The context of this verse involves a Hebrew servant girl who may be selected by her master for marriage to his son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The individual who has the authority to arrange the marriage of the servant girl to his son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/son.htm">Son</a></b><br>The master's son, who is the intended husband of the servant girl.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_society.htm">Israelite Society</a></b><br>The cultural and legal backdrop of ancient Israel, where these laws were given to ensure justice and protection for vulnerable individuals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mosaic_law.htm">Mosaic Law</a></b><br>The broader legal framework given by God through Moses, which includes various civil, ceremonial, and moral laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_and_dignity_of_individuals.htm">Value and Dignity of Individuals</a></b><br>This law underscores the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their social status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_integration.htm">Family Integration</a></b><br>The requirement to treat the servant girl as a daughter upon marriage to the son highlights the importance of family integration and acceptance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_care_for_the_vulnerable.htm">God&#8217;s Justice and Care for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>This law reflects God's concern for the vulnerable and marginalized, ensuring they are protected and valued within society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_covenant.htm">Marriage as a Covenant</a></b><br>The verse reinforces the idea of marriage as a covenant relationship that requires commitment and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_timeless_principles.htm">Cultural Context and Timeless Principles</a></b><br>While the cultural context of this law is ancient, the principles of justice, dignity, and family are timeless and applicable today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_21_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 21:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_9_Fairness_and_respect_guide.htm">How does Exodus 21:9 guide us in treating others with fairness and respect?

Should he decide that she become the betrothed of his own son, the relationship instantly shifts from master&#8211;servant to prospective father-in-law and daughter-in-law.<p>&#8226; This affirms the sanctity of marriage and the family line: the girl may have entered the household as a servant, but once chosen for the son she is on the path to covenant marriage, the same covenant that began with Adam and Eve (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) and was protected in Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It also safeguards her dignity. Instead of leaving her future uncertain, the law provides her with a stable, honorable role within the family (compare <a href="/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10&#8211;11</a>, where a kinsman-redeemer likewise protects Ruth&#8217;s future).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must deal with her</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He&#8221; now refers to the father who made the original purchase.
