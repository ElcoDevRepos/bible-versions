The use of "deal shrewdly" indicates a calculated plan to suppress the Israelites, who were seen as a threat due to their rapid multiplication. This echoes the serpent's cunning in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where deceit and manipulation are used to achieve a desired outcome. The Pharaoh's fear-driven policy contrasts with God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation.<p><b>or they will increase even more</b><br>The concern over the Israelites' increasing numbers highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). This growth is seen as a divine blessing, yet it becomes a source of fear for the Egyptians. The tension between divine blessing and human fear is a recurring theme in the Bible, illustrating how God's plans often transcend human understanding and control.<p><b>and if a war breaks out</b><br>This phrase suggests a fear of potential conflict, possibly with neighboring nations or internal uprisings. Historically, Egypt was a powerful empire, but it faced threats from surrounding regions. The Pharaoh's concern reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of preemptively dealing with potential threats to maintain power and stability. This fear of war underscores the political and military tensions of the time.<p><b>they may join our enemies</b><br>The possibility of the Israelites allying with Egypt's enemies reveals the Pharaoh's paranoia and distrust. This fear of betrayal is reminiscent of later biblical narratives, such as the alliances and conflicts during the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. It also foreshadows the Israelites' eventual role in God's plan to establish a kingdom that transcends earthly alliances.<p><b>fight against us</b><br>The fear of the Israelites turning against the Egyptians highlights the potential for internal rebellion. This concern is rooted in the Egyptians' awareness of the Israelites' growing strength and numbers. It reflects a broader biblical theme of the oppressed rising against their oppressors, as seen in the eventual Exodus from Egypt, which is a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin.<p><b>and leave the country</b><br>The fear of the Israelites leaving Egypt points to the economic and labor implications for the Egyptians. The Israelites were a significant labor force, and their departure would have had a substantial impact on Egypt's economy. This foreshadows the eventual Exodus, where God delivers His people from bondage, symbolizing spiritual liberation. The departure from Egypt is a precursor to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who felt threatened by the growing population of the Israelites and sought to oppress them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob living in Egypt, whose increasing numbers caused fear among the Egyptians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were living and multiplying, leading to the Egyptians' fear of their potential power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The potential adversaries of Egypt that Pharaoh feared the Israelites might join in case of war.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The event and strategy initiated by Pharaoh to subdue the Israelites through forced labor and harsh treatment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_control.htm">Fear and Control</a></b><br>Pharaoh's fear led to oppressive control.

The Egyptians themselves would perhaps suppose a closer connection between them and the other Eastern races than really existed.<p><span class= "bld">Get them up out of the land.</span>--The Pharaohs of the nineteenth dynasty were excessively jealous of the withdrawal from Egypt of any of their subjects, and endeavoured both to hinder and to recover them. Immigration was encouraged, emigration sternly checked. The loss of the entire nation of the Hebrews could not be contemplated without extreme alarm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come on</span>. The "Come then" of Kalisch is better. <span class="cmt_word">Let us deal wisely</span>. "The children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light." Severe grinding labour has often been used as a means of keeping down the aspirations of a people, if not of actually diminishing their numbers, and has been found to answer. Aristotle (Pol. 5:9) ascribes to this motive the building of the Pyramids and the great works of Polycrates of Samos, Pisistratus of Athens, and the Cypselidae of Corinth. The constructions of the last Tarquin are thought to have had the same object (Liv. 1:56; Niebuhr, 'Roman History,' vol. 1. p. 479). <span class="cmt_word">Lest, when there falleth out any war</span>, <span class="cmt_word">they join also to our enemies</span>. 'At the accession of the nineteenth dynasty, though there was peace, war threatened. While the Egyptians, under the later monarchs of the eighteenth dynasty, had been quarrelling among themselves, a great nation upon their borders "had been growing up to an importance and power which began to endanger the Egyptian supremacy in Western Asia" (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 2). Both Rameses I. and his son Seti had almost immediately after their accession to engage in a war, which was rather defensive the, offensive, with the Khita, or Hittites, who were the great power of Syria (<span class="accented">ib</span>. pp. 9, 15, 16). At the commencement of his reign, Seti may well have feared a renewed invasion like that of the Hyksos, which would no doubt have been greatly helped by a rising of the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">And so get them up out of the land</span>. Literally, "And go up out of the land." The Pharaoh already fears that the Israelites will quit Egypt. As men of peaceful and industrious habits, and in some cases of considerable wealth (Joseph. 'Ant. Jud.' 2:9, &sect; 1), they at once increased the strength of Egypt and the revenue of the monarch. Egypt was always ready to receive refugees, and loth to lose them. We find in a treaty made by Rameses II., the son of Seti, with the Hittites, a proviso that any Egyptian subjects who quit the country, and transfer themselves to the dominion of the Hittite king, shall be sent back to Egypt ('Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 30). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Come,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1445;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
