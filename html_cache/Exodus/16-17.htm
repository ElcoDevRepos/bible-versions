The Israelites' compliance reflects their reliance on divine provision during their wilderness journey. This act of gathering manna was a test of faith and obedience, as God provided specific instructions on how much to gather and when. The Israelites' actions here can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of living by faith and trusting in God's daily provision, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, "Give us this day our daily bread."<p><b>Some gathered more,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the varying needs and responses among the Israelites. The gathering of more manna could reflect larger family sizes or greater appetites, but it also serves as a reminder of God's abundant provision. The act of gathering more than needed was addressed by God, as any excess would spoil, teaching the Israelites to trust in God's daily provision rather than hoarding resources. This principle is echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-15.htm">2 Corinthians 8:15</a>, which references the manna story to illustrate the importance of equality and sharing within the Christian community.<p><b>and some less.</b><br>This phrase indicates that some Israelites gathered less manna, possibly due to smaller family sizes or lesser needs. It underscores the sufficiency of God's provision, as everyone had enough according to their needs. This reflects the biblical principle of contentment and reliance on God's provision, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, "And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus."

The phrase points back to Moses&#8217; command in <a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a> to &#8220;Gather as much of it as each one needs.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Obedience is immediate; they trusted God&#8217;s word without delay, just as Noah &#8220;did all that God commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Abraham &#8220;went as the LORD had told him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Their action reveals faith in God&#8217;s daily provision, echoing <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which urges wholehearted trust rather than leaning on human understanding.<p>&#8211;

He supplied enough abundance that no one was limited by shortage (compare <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>, where He promises to &#8220;open the floodgates of heaven&#8221;).<p>&#8211; It also affirms individual responsibility: the larger the family, the more diligent their gathering (see <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a> about providing for one&#8217;s household).<p>&#8211; The scene anticipates Jesus feeding the five thousand, where the disciples collected twelve baskets of leftovers (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12-13</a>), underscoring God&#8217;s capacity to give &#8220;far more abundantly&#8221;
