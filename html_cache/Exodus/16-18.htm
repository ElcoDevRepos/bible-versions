This measurement was used to ensure that each person received an equal portion of manna, the miraculous food provided by God during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness. The use of the omer highlights the importance of fairness and equality in God's provision, ensuring that each family had enough to meet their daily needs.<p><b>he who gathered much had no excess</b><br>This phrase illustrates the miraculous nature of God's provision. Despite the varying amounts gathered, the outcome was always perfectly sufficient. This reflects the principle of divine sufficiency, where God provides exactly what is needed, neither more nor less. It also serves as a reminder of the futility of hoarding and the importance of trusting in God's daily provision, as seen in the Lord's Prayer: "Give us this day our daily bread" (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p><b>and he who gathered little had no shortfall</b><br>This demonstrates God's equitable distribution of resources, ensuring that even those who gathered less still had enough. It underscores the theme of God's care and provision for all His people, regardless of their ability or effort. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of equality in the body of Christ, where each member is given what they need to contribute to the whole (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the sufficiency of God's provision. It reflects the principle of contentment and reliance on God for daily needs, a theme echoed throughout Scripture. The Israelites' experience with manna is a type of Christ, the Bread of Life, who provides spiritual sustenance to all who believe in Him (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>).
