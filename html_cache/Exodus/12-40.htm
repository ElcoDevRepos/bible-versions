This time began with the arrival of Jacob and his family during a famine, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>. The Israelites initially settled in the land of Goshen, a fertile area suitable for their livestock. Over time, they grew from a family into a large nation. This period is significant as it marks the transition from the patriarchal age to the formation of a distinct people group, setting the stage for the Exodus.<p><b>was 430 years.</b><br>The 430 years is a key chronological marker in biblical history. This duration is often debated, with some interpretations suggesting it includes the time from Abraham's covenant with God to the Exodus. However, the straightforward reading here focuses on the Israelites' time in Egypt. This period saw the Israelites' transformation from favored guests to enslaved people, leading to their eventual deliverance. The number 430 also connects to <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>, where Paul discusses the law given 430 years after the promise to Abraham, highlighting the continuity of God's plan. This period foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, as the Exodus is a type of salvation, with Moses as a type of Christ leading his people to freedom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were living in Egypt during this period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where they lived for 430 years before the Exodus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, marking the end of their 430-year sojourn and the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_over_time.htm">God's Faithfulness Over Time</a></b><br>The 430 years in Egypt remind us of God's faithfulness to His promises, even over long periods.

The time is required by the genealogy of Joshua (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-22.htm">1 Chronicles 7:22-27</a>). It is in remarkable accordance with the traditions that Joseph was the minister of Apspi, and that the Jews went out under Menephthah. If not absolutely required for the multiplication of the race from "seventy souls" to above two millions, it is at any rate more in accord with that fact than the alternative number, 215.
