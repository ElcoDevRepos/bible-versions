The Egyptians had witnessed the power of God through the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. Moses appeals to God's concern for His own name and glory, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9-11</a>). The reputation of God among the nations is crucial, as it reflects His character and the truth of His promises.<p><b>&#8216;He brought them out with evil intent,</b><br>Moses argues that if God were to destroy the Israelites, the Egyptians might misinterpret His actions as malevolent. This phrase underscores the importance of God's intentions being understood as good and just. The deliverance from Egypt was a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, and any perception of evil intent would contradict His nature as revealed in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>, where God declares His plans for welfare and not for evil.<p><b>to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth&#8217;?</b><br>The mountains refer to the wilderness area where the Israelites were journeying. This phrase emphasizes the severity of the potential judgment. The idea of being wiped from the face of the earth echoes the language of total destruction, reminiscent of the flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>. It highlights the seriousness of Israel's sin with the golden calf and the potential consequences of breaking the covenant with God.<p><b>Turn from Your fierce anger</b><br>Moses intercedes on behalf of the people, asking God to turn away from His anger. This reflects the biblical theme of intercession, where a mediator pleads for mercy. It foreshadows the ultimate intercessor, Jesus Christ, who mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The concept of God's anger is consistent with His holiness and justice, yet His willingness to relent shows His mercy and grace.<p><b>and relent from doing harm to Your people.</b><br>Moses appeals to God's covenant relationship with Israel, referring to them as "Your people." This phrase underscores the special status of Israel as God's chosen nation, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The request for God to relent is a plea for mercy, highlighting the tension between justice and mercy that is ultimately resolved in the New Testament through the sacrifice of Christ, who takes upon Himself the punishment for sin, allowing God to be both just and the justifier (<a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

God&#8217;s deliverance was meant to proclaim His power (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>); Moses appeals to that purpose so it will not be undermined.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth&#8217;?</b><p>&#8226;
