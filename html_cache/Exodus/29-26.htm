In the context of Aaron's ordination, this act is part of the consecration ceremony for the priesthood. The ram is a significant animal in sacrificial rituals, symbolizing strength and substitution. The ordination of Aaron and his sons marks the establishment of the Levitical priesthood, which plays a crucial role in mediating between God and the Israelites. This act of taking the breast signifies the setting apart of the priesthood for holy service.<p><b>and wave it before the LORD as a wave offering</b><br>The wave offering is a ritual act where the offering is moved back and forth before the LORD, symbolizing the presentation and dedication of the offering to God. This act of waving signifies acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the offering's consecration to Him. The wave offering is a type of peace offering, which emphasizes fellowship and communion with God. It is a gesture of submission and gratitude, recognizing God's provision and blessing.<p><b>and it will be your portion</b><br>This phrase indicates that the breast of the ram, after being waved before the LORD, is designated as a portion for the priests. In the sacrificial system, certain parts of the offerings were given to the priests as their sustenance, as they had no inheritance of land like the other tribes of Israel. This provision underscores God's care for those who serve Him and highlights the principle of sharing in the blessings of the offerings. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel.
