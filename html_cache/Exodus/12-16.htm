The sacred assembly signifies a holy convocation, a gathering of the Israelites to worship and focus on God. This assembly marks the start of a week-long observance commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. The concept of a sacred assembly is rooted in the idea of setting apart time for God, reflecting the Sabbath principle of rest and worship. It emphasizes the importance of community worship and collective remembrance of God's deliverance.<p><b>and another on the seventh day</b><br>The seventh day marks the conclusion of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, bookending the festival with another sacred assembly. This structure highlights the importance of both the beginning and the end of the festival, reinforcing the theme of completion and rest. The seventh day is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing perfection and completion, as seen in the creation narrative. This day of assembly serves as a reminder of God's provision and the completion of the Israelites' journey from slavery to freedom.<p><b>You must not do any work on those days</b><br>This command underscores the sanctity of the sacred assemblies, aligning with the broader biblical principle of Sabbath rest. By refraining from work, the Israelites were to focus solely on worship and reflection, acknowledging God's sovereignty and provision. This cessation of labor is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the Sabbath commandment and other festival observances, emphasizing trust in God's provision rather than human effort.<p><b>except to prepare the meals&#8212;that is all you may do</b><br>The allowance for meal preparation indicates the practical needs of the people while maintaining the day's sanctity. This exception highlights the balance between spiritual observance and daily necessities. It reflects the understanding that while worship and rest are paramount, God also acknowledges human needs. This provision can be seen as a precursor to Jesus' teaching on the Sabbath, where He emphasizes mercy and necessity over strict legalism, as in <a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12:1-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who conveyed God's instructions regarding the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and were preparing for their exodus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they were about to be delivered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>The event marking God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, commemorated by the sacrifice of a lamb and the marking of doorposts with its blood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A seven-day festival beginning with the Passover, during which the Israelites were to eat bread without yeast, symbolizing their hasty departure from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_time.htm">Sacred Time</a></b><br>The importance of setting aside time for worship and reflection is emphasized.

The seven following days were to be "days of unleavened bread." On the first of these, the fifteenth of Abib (<a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD: seven days you must eat unleavened bread.">Leviticus 23:6</a>), there was to be a "holy convocation," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a general gathering of the people to the door of the sanctuary for sacrifice, worship, and perhaps instruction. (Comp. <a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm" title="And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.">Nehemiah 8:1</a>.) The term "convocation" implies that the people were summoned to attend; and the actual summons appears to have been made by the blowing of the silver trumpets (<a href="/numbers/10-2.htm" title="Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.">Numbers 10:2</a>). On the seventh day, the twenty-first of Abib, was to be another similar meeting. "No manner of work" was to be done on either of these two days; or rather, as explained in <a href="/context/leviticus/23-7.htm" title="In the first day you shall have an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:7-8</a>, "no servile work."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the first day there shall be an holy convocation</span>. After the Paschal meal on the evening of the 14th of Abib, there was to be a solemn assembly of the people on the next day for religions worship. The name "convocation;" applied to these gatherings, seems to show that originally the people were <span class="accented">summoned</span> to such meetings, as they still are by the <span class="accented">muezzin</span> from the minarets of mosques in Mahommedan countries, and by bells from the steeples of churches in Christian ones. <span class="cmt_word">And on the seventh day</span>. On the 22nd of Abib - the seventh day after the first holy convocation on the 15th (see <a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4-8</a>). Only two of the Jewish festivals were of this duration - the feast of unleavened bread, and the feast of tabernacles (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 39-42). The Christian Church has adopted the usage for Christmas, Easter, Ascension, and Whitsuntide, where the last day of the week is known technically as "the octave." <span class="cmt_word">No manner of work shall be done in them</span>. Festival-days were in all countries days of abstention from the ordinary business of life, which could not conveniently be carried on conjointly with attendance at the services, meetings, processions, etc., wherein the festival consisted. But absolute cessation from all work was nowhere strictly commanded except among the Hebrews, where it appears to have been connected with the belief in God's absolute rest after the six days of creation. The command here given was solemnly repeated in the law (<a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
