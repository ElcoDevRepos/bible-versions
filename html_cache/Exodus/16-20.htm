Moses, as God's appointed leader, conveyed divine instructions, yet the people often struggled with trust and obedience. This disobedience reflects a broader pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where God's people frequently fail to heed His commands, leading to consequences. This lack of trust in God's provision is a central issue, as seen in other instances such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32).<p><b>some people left part of it until morning,</b><br>The manna was given as a daily provision, symbolizing God's continual care and the need for daily reliance on Him. By leaving part of it until morning, the people demonstrated a lack of faith in God's promise to provide fresh manna each day. This act of keeping manna overnight can be seen as a metaphor for hoarding or relying on one's own understanding rather than trusting in God's timing and provision. It parallels the Lord's Prayer in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches to ask for "daily bread" (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>), emphasizing daily dependence on God.<p><b>and it became infested with maggots and began to smell.</b><br>The physical corruption of the manna serves as a tangible consequence of disobedience. This decay symbolizes the futility of human efforts apart from God's instructions. The imagery of maggots and odor underscores the immediate and unpleasant results of not following God's commands. It also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly provisions and the importance of spiritual sustenance, as later echoed in Jesus' teaching that He is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>So Moses was angry with them.</b><br>Moses' anger reflects righteous indignation at the people's lack of faith and disobedience. As a leader, Moses bore the responsibility of guiding the Israelites and was often frustrated by their repeated failures to trust God. This anger is not merely personal but represents God's own displeasure with the people's actions. Moses' role as an intercessor and leader foreshadows Christ, who also expressed righteous anger at sin and disbelief (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>). Moses' leadership challenges prefigure the ultimate leadership and mediation of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
