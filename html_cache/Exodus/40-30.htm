It was crafted from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting (<a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>). This act of placing the basin signifies the importance of purification before approaching God, emphasizing the need for cleanliness and holiness in worship.<p><b>between the Tent of Meeting and the altar</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. The altar referred to here is the bronze altar used for burnt offerings. The strategic placement of the basin between these two significant structures highlights its role in the sacrificial system. Priests were required to wash their hands and feet before performing sacrifices or entering the Tent of Meeting, symbolizing spiritual cleansing and preparation for service (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>).<p><b>and put water in it for washing;</b><br>The act of filling the basin with water underscores the practical and symbolic function of the laver. Water is a recurring symbol of purification and life throughout Scripture. In the New Testament, water is associated with baptism and the cleansing power of Jesus' sacrifice (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>). The washing ritual foreshadows the ultimate cleansing from sin provided through Christ, who is the living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who was instructed by God to set up the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the basin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basin.htm">The Basin (Laver)</a></b><br>A large bronze basin used for ceremonial washing, symbolizing purification and readiness to serve God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The place of sacrifice, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were to follow His commandments and maintain purity in worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purification.htm">Symbolism of Purification</a></b><br>The basin represents the need for spiritual cleansing before approaching God.

The water is not optional; it embodies God&#8217;s provision for purity.<p>&#8226; Later images of spiritual washing echo this moment: Jesus speaks of being &#8220;clean because of the word&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>), Paul writes of &#8220;the washing of water with the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>), and Titus points to &#8220;the washing of regeneration&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal water anticipates the living water Christ offers (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), showing that God always supplies what He commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for washing</b><p>&#8226; Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet &#8220;so that they will not die&#8221; when they approach (<a href="/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19-21</a>). Purity is life-or-death serious.<p>&#8226; The requirement highlights personal responsibility: before serving others, priests address their own uncleanness&#8212;mirrored in Jesus&#8217; call to Peter, &#8220;Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Old Testament ceremony points forward: believers draw near &#8220;having our bodies washed with pure water&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>). <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a> asks, &#8220;Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? He who has clean hands and a pure heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Washing therefore pictures ongoing confession and cleansing (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>), not a one-time event but a continual habit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/40-30.htm">Exodus 40:30</a> captures a crucial truth: before anyone can minister or meet with God, cleansing is essential. Moses places the bronze basin exactly where God said, fills it with water, and dedicates it to washing. Situated between sacrifice and sanctuary, the laver teaches that forgiveness and fellowship are inseparable from purity. The priests&#8217; literal washing foreshadows the spiritual cleansing every believer receives and continues to practice through the Word and by the Spirit, ensuring that worship remains holy and intimate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">And he set the laver between the tent . . . and the altar.</span>--On the bronze laver and its position in the Tabernacle, see the Notes on <a href="/exodus/30-18.htm" title="You shall also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash with: and you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and you shall put water therein.">Exodus 30:18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">set the laver.</span> As directed in ver. 7.
