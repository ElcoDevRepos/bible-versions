The context is a legal case within the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites after their exodus from Egypt. The law aimed to maintain order and justice within the community. Fighting among men could disrupt societal harmony, and the law sought to address the consequences of such actions.<p><b>strike a pregnant woman</b><br>The involvement of a pregnant woman highlights the vulnerability of both the woman and her unborn child. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, women were often seen as needing protection, and pregnancy added an additional layer of concern. The law here reflects a protective stance towards women and the unborn, emphasizing the value of life and the need for careful consideration of actions that could harm them.<p><b>and her child is born prematurely</b><br>This phrase indicates a premature birth resulting from the altercation. The Hebrew term used can imply a miscarriage or premature birth, and the interpretation has been debated among scholars. The focus is on the outcome of the altercation affecting the unborn child, which underscores the importance of the unborn life in biblical law.<p><b>but there is no further injury</b><br>The absence of further injury suggests that the premature birth did not result in lasting harm to the mother or child. This distinction is crucial in determining the legal consequences. The law differentiates between outcomes, showing a nuanced approach to justice that considers the extent of harm caused.<p><b>he shall surely be fined</b><br>The imposition of a fine indicates a form of restitution, a common legal remedy in ancient Israel. The fine serves as a deterrent and a means of compensating for the wrongdoing. It reflects the principle of justice that requires offenders to make amends for their actions.<p><b>as the woman&#8217;s husband demands</b><br>The husband's role in demanding the fine reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where the husband acted as the representative and protector of his family. His involvement ensures that the compensation aligns with the perceived harm and family needs.<p><b>and as the court allows</b><br>The involvement of the court introduces a legal authority to ensure fairness and prevent excessive demands. This reflects the structured legal system within Israel, where judges or elders would oversee disputes and ensure justice was served according to God's law. The court's role ensures that the fine is just and appropriate, balancing the husband's demands with legal standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_striving_together.htm">Men Striving Together</a></b><br>This refers to a conflict or fight between two or more men, which inadvertently affects a pregnant woman.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pregnant_woman.htm">Pregnant Woman</a></b><br>A woman carrying a child, who becomes involved in the conflict unintentionally.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_come_out.htm">Children Come Out</a></b><br>This phrase indicates a premature birth caused by the altercation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The woman's spouse, who has a role in determining the fine imposed on the offender.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Authorities who assess the situation and determine the appropriate penalty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_life.htm">Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>This passage emphasizes the value of both the mother and the unborn child, highlighting the importance of protecting life at all stages.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_and_consequences.htm">Responsibility and Consequences</a></b><br>Actions have consequences, and this law underscores the responsibility individuals have for unintended harm caused by their actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_authority.htm">Role of Authority</a></b><br>The involvement of judges illustrates the importance of impartial authorities in maintaining justice and order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/conflict_resolution.htm">Conflict Resolution</a></b><br>The passage encourages us to consider the impact of our conflicts on others and to seek peaceful resolutions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>The community, represented by the husband and judges, plays a role in ensuring justice, reminding us of our collective responsibility to uphold righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_21_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_22_Unborn_life_s_value.htm">How does Exodus 21:22 emphasize the value of unborn life in God's eyes?

The passage affirms that life in the womb matters, personal responsibility extends even to unintended harm, and God&#8217;s justice blends compassion with accountability.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22-25) A personal injury peculiar to women--a hurt producing miscarriage--is here considered. The miscarriage might cost the woman her life, in which case the man who caused it was to suffer death (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm" title="And if any mischief follow, then you shall give life for life,">Exodus 21:23</a>); or it might have no further ill result than the loss of the child. In this latter case the penalty was to be a fine, assessed by the husband with the consent of the judge (<a href="/exodus/21-22.htm" title="If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.">Exodus 21:22</a>). The death penalty, where the woman died, is clearly excessive, and probably belongs to the pre-Mosaic legislation, which required "life for life" in every case.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">If men strive, and hurt a woman with child.</span>--It is assumed that this hurt would probably take place through the interference of a pregnant wife in some strife wherein her husband was engaged. It would almost certainly be accidental.<p><span class= "bld">And yet no mischief follow</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>no further mischief--nothing beyond the loss of the child.<p>(22, 23) <span class= "bld">Life for life, eye for eye.</span>--It is a reasonable conjecture that the law of retaliation was much older than Moses, and accepted by him as tolerable rather than devised as rightful. The law itself was very widely spread. Traces of it are found in India, in Egypt, among the Greeks, and in the laws of the Twelve Tables. Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans approved it, and that it was believed to be the rule by which Rhadamanthus administered justice in the other world. There is, <span class= "ital">prima facie, </span>a semblance of exact rectitude and equality about it which captivates rude minds, and causes the adoption of the rule generally in an early condition of society. Theoretically, retaliation is the exactest and strictest justice; but in practice difficulties arise. How is the force of a blow to be measured? How are exactly similar burns and wounds to be inflicted? Is eye to be given for eye when the injurer is a one-eyed man? And, again, is it expedient for law to multiply the number of mutilated citizens in a community? Considerations of these kinds cause the rule to be discarded as soon as civilisation reaches a certain point, and tend generally to the substitution of a money compensation, to be paid to the injured party by the injurer. The present passage sanctioned the law of retaliation in principle, but authorised its enforcement in a single case only. In a later part of the Mosaic code the application was made universal (<a href="/context/leviticus/24-17.htm" title="And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 24:17-21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-21.htm" title="And your eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22-25.</span> - <span class="accented">Assault producing miscarriage. Retaliation</span>. Women in all countries are apt to interfere in the quarrels of men, and run the risk of suffering injuries which proceed from accident rather than design, one such injury being of a peculiar character, to which there is nothing correspondent among the injuries which may be done to man. This is abortion, or miscarriage. The Mosaic legislation sought to protect pregnant women from suffering this injury by providing, first, that if death resulted the offender should suffer death (ver. 23); and, secondly, that if there were no further ill-result than the miscarriage itself, still a fine should be paid, to be assessed by the husband of the injured woman with the consent of the judges (ver. 22). The mention of "life for life," in ver. 23, is followed by an enunciation of the general "law of retaliation," applied here (it would seem) to the special case in hand, but elsewhere (<a href="/leviticus/24-19.htm">Leviticus 24:19, 20</a>) extended so as to be a fundamental law, applicable to all cases of personal injury. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If men strive and hurt a</span> <span class="cmt_word">woman.</span> A chance hurt is clearly intended, not one done on purpose. <span class="cmt_word">So that her fruit depart from her</span>. So that she be prematurely delivered of a dead child. <span class="cmt_word">And no mischief follow</span>. "Mischief" here means "death," as in <a href="/genesis/42-4.htm">Genesis 42:4, 38</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-29.htm">Genesis 44:29</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall pay as the judges determine</span>. He was not to be wholly at the mercy of the injured father. If he thought the sum demanded was excessive, there was to be an appeal to a tribunal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
