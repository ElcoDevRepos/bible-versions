Their role was crucial in guiding the people through the wilderness. This phrase highlights the importance of leadership and obedience to God's chosen representatives. The Israelites, a large group estimated to be over a million people, were in a state of transition and needed clear guidance. This moment underscores the communal aspect of Israel's journey, where messages from God were delivered to the entire assembly, emphasizing unity and collective responsibility.<p><b>This evening you will know</b><br>The phrase "this evening" indicates a specific time when God would reveal His power and faithfulness. It sets the stage for an immediate demonstration of God's presence and provision. The use of "you will know" suggests a deeper understanding and recognition of God's sovereignty and involvement in their lives. This knowledge is not just intellectual but experiential, as the Israelites would witness a tangible sign of God's care. The timing also reflects the biblical pattern of God acting at appointed times, often in the evening, as seen in other scriptural events.<p><b>that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This statement reaffirms God's role as the deliverer of Israel, reminding them of the miraculous exodus from Egypt. It serves as a reminder of God's covenant faithfulness and His power over the false gods of Egypt. The emphasis on "the LORD" (YHWH) highlights His personal name, signifying a relationship with His people. This deliverance is a type of salvation, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. The exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, often referenced throughout the Bible as a symbol of God's redemptive power and faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
