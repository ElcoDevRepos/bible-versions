It symbolizes purification and the need for cleanliness before approaching God. The use of bronze, a durable and reflective material, may signify the enduring nature of God's requirements for holiness. The basin's placement and use highlight the importance of ritual purity in worship practices.<p><b>between the Tent of Meeting and the altar</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. The altar, specifically the bronze altar, was used for burnt offerings. Placing the basin between these two significant structures underscores its role as a mediator between sacrifice and divine presence. This positioning reflects the necessity of cleansing before entering into God's presence or offering sacrifices, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, which speaks of having clean hands and a pure heart.<p><b>and put water in it</b><br>Water in the basin was used by the priests for washing their hands and feet before performing their duties, as commanded in <a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>. This act of washing symbolizes spiritual cleansing and preparation for service. Water is a recurring symbol of purification throughout Scripture, seen in the New Testament with the concept of baptism (e.g., <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>).
