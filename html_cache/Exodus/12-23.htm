The LORD's action here is a direct intervention in human history, demonstrating His sovereignty and power. This event is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative, leading to the liberation of the Israelites from slavery. The judgment against the Egyptians also serves as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that He would judge the nation that enslaved his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>).<p><b>He will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe</b><br>The blood on the doorframe is the blood of a lamb, which the Israelites were commanded to apply as a sign of their faith and obedience. This act of marking the doorframes with blood is a type of Christ, foreshadowing the sacrificial death of Jesus, the Lamb of God, whose blood brings salvation and protection from spiritual death (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The specific instruction to place the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe symbolizes a complete covering, indicating total protection.<p><b>and will pass over that doorway</b><br>The term "pass over" is the origin of the Jewish festival of Passover, commemorating this event. It signifies God's mercy and grace in sparing the Israelites from the plague. This act of passing over is a demonstration of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, highlighting the theme of redemption that runs throughout Scripture. The Passover event is a precursor to the ultimate redemption through Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>so He will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down</b><br>The "destroyer" is often understood as an angel of death or a divine agent executing God's judgment. This protection from the destroyer underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the power of the blood as a means of salvation. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of divine protection for those who trust in God (<a href="/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10-11</a>). The sparing of the Israelites' firstborn is a testament to God's ability to distinguish between those who are His and those who are not, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the separation of the sheep and the goats (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who acts as both judge and protector in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, who are subject to God's judgment through the plagues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are instructed to mark their homes with lamb's blood to be spared from the final plague.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destroyer.htm">The Destroyer</a></b><br>A divine agent of judgment, often interpreted as an angel or a manifestation of God's wrath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>The event where God "passes over" the homes marked with blood, sparing the Israelites from the plague of the firstborn.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_obedience.htm">The Power of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' obedience in applying the blood was crucial for their protection.

The only important difference is, the new expression, "The Lord will not suffer the destroyer to come in," which has generally been regarded as implying, that the actual agent in the killing of the first-born was a "destroying angel." But it is to be noted that elsewhere Jehovah himself is everywhere spoken of as the sole agent; and that in the present passage the word used has the meaning of "destruction" no less than that of "destroyer." Bishop Lowth's idea of an opposition between God and the destroying angel (<span class="accented">Comment on Isaiah</span> 31:5) is scarcely tenable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">passes through</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
