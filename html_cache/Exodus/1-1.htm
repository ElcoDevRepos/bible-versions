The "sons of Israel" refers to the twelve tribes of Israel, foundational to the nation's identity. The listing of names signifies the importance of lineage and heritage in biblical history, underscoring the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham's descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p><b>who went to Egypt with Jacob</b><br>This part of the verse recalls the migration of Jacob and his family to Egypt, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>. This move was prompted by a severe famine and Joseph's position of power in Egypt. It marks the beginning of Israel's sojourn in Egypt, setting the stage for their eventual enslavement and the Exodus. The journey to Egypt was a pivotal moment in Israel's history, fulfilling God's word to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p><b>each with his family</b><br>The mention of "each with his family" highlights the familial structure and unity of the tribes of Israel. It underscores the importance of family in maintaining cultural and religious identity, especially in a foreign land. This detail also foreshadows the multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt, as they grew from a family into a nation, fulfilling God's promise of numerous descendants (<a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_israel.htm">Sons of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the twelve sons of Jacob, who are the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel.

By naming names, tracing lineage, recording the move to Egypt under Jacob&#8217;s leadership, and noting each family unit, the verse announces that the unfolding drama is personal, purposeful, and anchored in God&#8217;s faithful, literal promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE ISRAELITES IN EGYPT, AND THEIR OPPRESSION BY A NEW KING.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now these are the names.</span>--The divisions between the <span class= "ital">"</span>books "of the Pentateuch are not arbitrary.

Literally, "And these are the names." Compare <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a>, where the phrase used is the same. We have here the first example of that almost <span class="accented">universal</span> practice of fife writers of the Historical Scriptures to connect book with book in the closest possible way by the simple copulative "and." (Compare <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>, <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.) This practice, so unlike that of secular writers, can only be explained by the instinctive feeling of all, that they were contributors to a <span class="accented">single</span> book, each later writer a continuator of the narrative placed on record by his predecessor. In the Pentateuch, if we admit a single author, the initial <span class="accented">vau</span> will be less remarkable, since it will merely serve to join together the different sections of a single treatise. <span class="cmt_word">Which came into Egypt</span>. The next two words of the original, "with Jacob," belong properly to this clause. The whole verse is best translated, "Now these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt with Jacob: they came every man with his household." So the LXX., Pagnini, Kalisch, Geddes, Boothroyd, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Every man and his household</span>. This is important in connection with the vexed question of the possible increase of the original band of so-called "Israelites" within the space of 430 years to such a number as is said to have quitted Egypt with Moses (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The "household" of Abraham comprised 318 adult males (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). The "households" of Jacob, his eleven sons, and his numerous grown-up grandsons, have been with reason estimated at "several thousands." (Kurtz, 'History of the Old Covenant,' vol. 2 p. 149, E.
