It signifies obedience and faith, as Moses acts according to God's command. The stretching out of the hand is symbolic of divine intervention and authority. This act parallels other instances where Moses uses his staff to perform miracles, such as striking the rock to bring forth water (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). It also foreshadows the miracles of Jesus, who performed acts of power over nature, such as calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>and all that night the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind</b><br>The use of a "strong east wind" highlights God's control over natural elements. In the ancient Near East, winds were often seen as instruments of divine power. The east wind, in particular, is mentioned in other biblical contexts as a force of judgment or deliverance (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>, <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>). This event emphasizes God's sovereignty and His ability to use creation to fulfill His purposes. The timing, "all that night," suggests a process that required faith and patience from the Israelites.<p><b>that turned it into dry land</b><br>The transformation of the sea into dry land is a miraculous event that underscores God's power to make a way where there seems to be none. This act of creating dry land is reminiscent of the creation narrative in Genesis, where God separates the waters to form dry ground (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). It symbolizes new beginnings and deliverance, as the Israelites are about to embark on a journey to the Promised Land. This event is also a type of baptism, representing the transition from slavery to freedom, as later referenced in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>.<p><b>So the waters were divided</b><br>The division of the waters is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative, marking the definitive act of liberation for the Israelites. It serves as a powerful testament to God's faithfulness and His covenant with His people. This miraculous division is echoed in other biblical accounts, such as the crossing of the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>), reinforcing the theme of God's deliverance. Theologically, it prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who provides a way for humanity to cross from death to life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.

If we imagine the Bitter Lakes joined to the Red Sea by a narrow and shallow channel, and a south-east wind blowing strongly up this channel, we can easily conceive that the water in the Bitter Lakes might be driven northward, and' held there, while the natural action of the ebb tide withdrew the Red Sea water to the southward. A portion of the channel might in this way have been left dry, and have so continued until the wind changed and the tide began to flow. It is true that Scripture does not speak of the ebb and flow of the tide, since in them there was nothing unusual; but an Egyptian tradition distinctly stated that "Moses waited for the ebb tide in order to lead the Israelites across." (Artipanus, ap. Euseb. <span class= "ital">Pr?p. Ev</span>., 9:27.) Whether the whole effect was purely natural, or whether (as in so many other cases) Goa used the force of nature so far as it could go, and further supernaturally increased its force, we are not told, and may form what opinion we please.<p><span class= "bld">The waters were divided.</span>--The waters of the Bitter Lakes were for a time separated completely from those of the Red Sea. By gradual elevation and desiccation the channel over which the Israelites passed has probably now become dry land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses stretched out his hand</span>. As commanded by God (ver. 16). Compare the somewhat similar action of Elijah and Elisha, when they divided the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind</span>. The LXX. translate "a strong south wind" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>); but the Hebrew <span class="accented">kadim</span> is certainly "east" rather than "south." It is not, however, "east" in the sense of due east, but would include all the range of the compass between N.E. and S.E. If we suppose the Bitter Lakes to have been joined to the Red Sea by a narrow and shallow channel, the action of a south-east wind, by driving the water of the Lakes northward, may have easily produced the effect described in the text. A simultaneous ebb of the lower gulf would have further facilitated the passage. <span class="cmt_word">The waters were divided</span>. Water remained in the upper extremity of the Gulf, now the site of the Bitter Lakes, and also, of course, below Suez. The portion of the sea dried up lay probably between the present southern extremity of the Bitter Lakes and Suez. By the gradual elevation and desiccation of the region, it has passed into permanent dry land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/14-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stretched out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
