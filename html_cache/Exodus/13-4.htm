God is not speaking of an idea or a parable; He is acting in time and space, just as He promised (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often underscores &#8220;today&#8221; to impress urgency and call people to immediate faith&#8212;&#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/bsb/exodus/13.htm">Exodus 13</a>, &#8220;today&#8221; signals that Israel&#8217;s long-awaited deliverance has arrived. What had been foretold to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>) is happening now, reinforcing God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; This anchoring in the present invites every generation to remember God&#8217;s salvation as a living reality, much like Joshua later said, &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the month of Abib</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Abib&#8221; marks the first month of Israel&#8217;s calendar, corresponding to early spring (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). By naming the month, God establishes a perpetual anniversary: the Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread will always occur in Abib (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing aligns with new growth in the fields, symbolizing fresh beginnings. Just as barley heads ripen in Abib, Israel is emerging from slavery into new life&#8212;a theme echoed when Jesus rose &#8220;on the first day of the week,&#8221; opening a new covenant (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Pinpointing the month also guards against mythologizing the exodus. It ties the event to a verifiable season, confirming its historicity (<a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The calendar God gives His people places redemption at its center; every subsequent celebration or harvest counts forward from this foundational act (<a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are leaving</b><p>&#8226; The phrase captures a decisive break: Egypt&#8217;s chains are falling off &#8220;this very day&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-33</a>), fulfilling the promise that God would bring His people out &#8220;with a mighty hand&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Leaving&#8221; is not merely departing a location; it is leaving behind an identity as slaves to become a holy nation belonging to the Lord (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The exodus pattern&#8212;deliverance, journey, covenant&#8212;reappears throughout Scripture. Jesus speaks of His own &#8220;departure&#8221; (literally &#8220;exodus&#8221;) at the cross (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>), inviting believers to follow Him out of bondage to sin (<a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; By commanding Israel to commemorate their exit annually (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3, 8</a>-10), God ensures each generation personally identifies with this liberation, echoing Paul&#8217;s charge: &#8220;For freedom Christ has set us free&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/13-4.htm">Exodus 13:4</a> pinpoints the very moment God turns promise into history: &#8220;Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.&#8221; The immediacy of &#8220;today,&#8221; the seasonal marker &#8220;Abib,&#8221; and the action &#8220;you are leaving&#8221; combine to affirm that God&#8217;s salvation is literal, timely, and transformative.
