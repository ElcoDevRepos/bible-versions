After forty days on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), Moses must now carry the revealed word to the people who have already broken covenant.<p>&#8226; It reminds us that devotion to God always leads to action among people (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went down the mountain</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Went down the mountain&#8221; underscores that God&#8217;s law descends to meet humanity, rather than humanity climbing to attain it (cf. <a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical descent parallels the coming judgment: Moses leaves glory to face idolatry, foreshadowing how Christ left heaven to deal with sin (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Sinai becomes the stage where holiness and human rebellion collide, setting up the dramatic confrontation in verses 19-20.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two tablets of the Testimony</b><p>&#8226; Moses carries &#8220;the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands.&#8221; &#8220;Testimony&#8221; (also <a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; 31:18) points to the covenant documents&#8212;God&#8217;s binding witness of His will.<p>&#8226; Tablets signify permanence; stone cannot be edited like parchment.

The entire conference between God and Moses being now ended, Moses hastened to descend from the mount, and interpose in the crisis that had arisen, he took carefully the two tables of stone, which he had received, in his two hands (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15</a>), and set out on his return to the camp. On the way, he fell in with Joshua, who must have been on the watch for his descent, and the two proceeded together. When a certain portion of the distance had been traversed, the sounds of the festivity which was going on in the camp reached their ears; and Joshua, mistaking the nature of the shouts, suggested that fighting was in progress (ver. 17). Moses, however, better instructed in the actual nature of the proceedings (vers. 7, 8), caught their character more correctly, and declared that what he heard was nothing but shouting (ver. 18). Soon afterwards, the camp came into sight - a disorderly crowd, half stripped of their garments (ver. 25), was singing choruses and dancing round the figure which Aaron had cast - the sights and sounds were those of a dissolute orgy - Moses was struck with horror and in the frenzy of his indignation, dashed the two tables to the ground and broke them into fragments (ver. 19). The people, he felt, were utterly unworthy of the holy laws which he had brought them - they had "altogether gone out of the way" - they had become "abominable" - at the moment he perhaps despaired of obtaining mercy for them, and expected their entire destruction. God had not as yet told him whether he would "turn from his fierce wrath," or not. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The two tables... were in his hand</span>. In <a href="/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15</a>, using greater particularity, Moses says that they were "in his two hands." One was in each hand probably. Written on both their sides. This is the case generally with Assyrian and Babylonian tablets, but not with Egyptian ones, which are moreover scarcely found at this early date. Here we seem to have again an indication that some of the Israelitic civilisation had come to them from "Ur of the Chaldees." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/32-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1508;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;p&#772;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
