The wheat and spelt were not destroyed because they had not yet matured. This detail underscores God's control over the natural world and His ability to protect certain elements even amidst judgment. Wheat and spelt were staple grains in ancient Egypt, essential for daily sustenance and economic stability. The preservation of these crops indicates a measure of mercy, allowing for future provision despite the devastation.<p><b>because they are late crops</b><br>Wheat and spelt are described as late crops, meaning they mature later in the growing season compared to barley and flax, which were destroyed by the hail. This agricultural detail provides insight into the timing of the plagues, likely occurring around February or March. The survival of these crops serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the precision of His judgments. It also foreshadows the continued opportunity for Pharaoh to repent, as the preservation of these crops suggests that God&#8217;s judgments are not yet final.
