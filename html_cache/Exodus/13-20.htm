This location is significant as it marks the beginning of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. Succoth, meaning "booths" or "temporary shelters," symbolizes the transient nature of their journey and reliance on God's provision. Historically, Succoth is believed to be located in the eastern Nile Delta, a region that was fertile and suitable for initial encampment. This departure signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from bondage, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>.<p><b>and camped at Etham</b><br>Etham is described as being on the edge of the wilderness, indicating a transition from the more settled areas of Egypt to the desolate and challenging terrain of the wilderness. The exact location of Etham is uncertain, but it is thought to be near the eastern border of Egypt, possibly in the region of the modern-day Suez Canal. This encampment represents a critical point in the journey, as the Israelites are moving closer to the Red Sea crossing, a pivotal event in their deliverance. The name Etham may mean "fortress," suggesting a place of strength or protection, which is fitting as God was their protector.<p><b>on the edge of the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness mentioned here is likely the Wilderness of Shur, a barren and inhospitable area that the Israelites would soon traverse. This phrase highlights the beginning of a period of testing and reliance on God for sustenance and guidance. The wilderness journey is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing purification and preparation for entering the Promised Land. It foreshadows the 40 years of wandering due to the Israelites' disobedience and lack of faith, as recounted in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>. The wilderness experience also serves as a type of Christ's own time in the wilderness, where He was tempted and emerged victorious, as described in <a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/succoth.htm">Succoth</a></b><br>The first encampment of the Israelites after leaving Egypt, symbolizing the beginning of their journey of faith and reliance on God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/etham.htm">Etham</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites camped on the edge of the wilderness, representing a transitional phase between leaving Egypt and entering the unknown.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A place of testing and reliance on God, where the Israelites would learn to trust in His provision and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_guidance.htm">Trust in God's Guidance</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites followed God's lead from Succoth to Etham, we are called to trust in His direction for our lives, even when the path is uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transition_and_growth.htm">Transition and Growth</a></b><br>The move from Succoth to Etham symbolizes transitions in our spiritual journey.

Having witnessed the Lord&#8217;s deliverance through the Passover night, Israel moves when He says move (<a href="/exodus/12-50.htm">Exodus 12:50&#8211;51</a>). Their departure fulfills God&#8217;s pledge made to Abraham centuries earlier (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13&#8211;14</a>) and demonstrates that the deliverance is not merely spiritual but physical, historical, and observable.

Succoth may have been at or near Tel Dafneh, about fifteen miles from Tanis, and Etham near the modern Ismailia, on the verge of the desert. Dr. Brugsch's identification of Etham with the Egyptian <span class= "ital">Khetam</span> is highly improbable, since the Hebrew <span class= "ital">aleph</span> never replaces the Egyptian <span class= "ital">kh,</span> which is a very strong guttural. E-tham would mean "the house of Turn," and point to a temple of the Sun-god, who was specially worshipped in the Eastern Delta, at Heliopolis, Patumus, and elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they took their journey from Succoth and encamped in Etham</span>. On the probable position of Etham, see the "Introduction" to this book. The word probably means "House of Turn," and implies the existence at the place of a temple of the Sun-God, who was commonly worshipped as Tuna or Atum. The name, therefore, is nearly equivalent to Pithom (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>), which means "City of Turn;" but it is not likely that Moses designated the same place by two distinct appellations. The site of Etham, moreover, does not agree with that of the Patumos of Herodotus (2:158), which is generally allowed to be Pithom. <p> CHAPTER 13:21, 22 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/13-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5265.htm">Strong's 5265: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull up, the tent-pins, start on a, journey</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from Succoth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mis&#183;suk&#183;k&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5523.htm">Strong's 5523: </a> </span><span class="str2">Succoth -- a city East of the Jordan, also a place in Egypt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and camped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2583.htm">Strong's 2583: </a> </span><span class="str2">To incline, to decline, to pitch a, tent, gen, to encamp</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at Etham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_864.htm">Strong's 864: </a> </span><span class="str2">Etham -- a place in Egypt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on the edge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(biq&#183;&#7779;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7097.htm">Strong's 7097: </a> </span><span class="str2">End, extremity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the wilderness.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;b&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4057.htm">Strong's 4057: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pasture, a desert, speech</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/13-20.htm">OT Law: Exodus 13:20 They took their journey from Succoth (Exo.
