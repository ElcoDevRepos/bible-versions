The mention of a "purchased" slave indicates a legal transaction, suggesting ownership and integration into the household. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption, where God "purchases" His people from slavery to sin. The concept of being bought and belonging to a new master parallels the New Testament teaching of believers being bought with a price (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>).<p><b>may eat of it</b><br>The "it" refers to the Passover meal, a significant event in Israelite history commemorating their deliverance from Egypt. Eating the Passover was a sign of inclusion in the covenant community. This inclusion of a purchased slave highlights the expansive nature of God's covenant, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith community, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>after you have circumcised him</b><br>Circumcision was the physical sign of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It was a prerequisite for participation in the Passover, symbolizing purification and commitment to God. This requirement underscores the importance of covenant identity and purity before partaking in holy observances. In the New Testament, circumcision of the heart becomes the focus (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>), pointing to an inward transformation necessary for true inclusion in God's people. This transformation is fulfilled in Christ, who brings both Jews and Gentiles into one body through faith (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to observe the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Specifically, those who are bought with money, indicating a bondservant or slave in the household of an Israelite.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, required for participation in the Passover.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>A significant event where the Israelites were commanded to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood, leading to their deliverance from Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites are being delivered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_god's_covenant.htm">Inclusivity in God's Covenant</a></b><br>The requirement for circumcision before partaking in the Passover meal highlights the inclusivity of God's covenant.

including a slave who is born in your household or acquired with money&#8230; shall be circumcised.&#8221; Even before the exodus, Abraham&#8217;s household slaves were enfolded into covenant life.<p>&#8226; By mentioning a &#8220;slave,&#8221; God reminds Israel that redemption and belonging come by His covenant, not by social status. <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> carries the principle forward: &#8220;there is neither slave nor free&#8230; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has been purchased</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;who has been purchased&#8230;&#8221; underscores ownership that transfers the slave into the master&#8217;s covenant household.<p>&#8226;

A hireling is temporary; a purchased slave is a permanent member of the household and therefore may share its worship.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the image hints at redemption. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a> reminds believers, &#8220;you were bought at a price,&#8221; echoing the Passover motif of being claimed by God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may eat of it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;may eat of it&#8230;&#8221; grants full participation in the Passover meal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3&#8211;11</a> outlines the meal itself; it was more than food&#8212;it proclaimed salvation.<p>&#8226; By eating, the slave shares the same protection described in <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>: &#8220;when I see the blood, I will pass over you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; New-covenant fulfillment shines in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>: &#8220;For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.&#8221; Everyone purchased by Christ&#8217;s blood shares the deliverance prefigured in Egypt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after you have circumcised him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;after you have circumcised him&#8221; preserves the covenant sign given to Abraham.<p>&#8226; Circumcision marked entry into God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>); without it, participation in Passover was impossible (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a> records a later national circumcision before celebrating Passover in Canaan, tying the two rites together.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a> speaks of a &#8220;circumcision made without hands,&#8221; showing the outward sign&#8217;s deeper spiritual reality in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44</a> teaches that the blessings of God&#8217;s redemptive meal reach anyone incorporated into His covenant&#8212;yes, even a slave&#8212;once the covenant sign is received. Social standing does not hinder fellowship; purchased and marked as belonging, the slave eats the same lamb and enjoys the same deliverance. The verse foreshadows the wider redemption accomplished in Christ, where all who are &#8220;bought at a price&#8221; are welcomed to the table of salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">Every man's servant.</span>--Slaves born in the house were required to be circumcised on the eighth day, like Israelites (<a href="/genesis/17-13.htm" title="He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.">Genesis 17:13</a>). Bought slaves were allowed their choice. It is noticeable that the circumcised slave was to be admitted to full religious equality with his master.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man's servant that is bought for money</span>. Or "every man's slave." The Mosaic Law found servitude existing, and left it existing, only guarding against its extreme <span class="accented">abuses</span> (<a href="/exodus/21-20.htm">Exodus 21:20-27</a>). It put no check on the traffic in slaves. <span class="cmt_word">When thou hast circumcised him</span>. The Jewish commentators say, that the desire of the slave to receive the rite and become a Jew is here implied. But it would seem rather, that opposition and refusal is not thought of as possible (see <a href="/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13, 17</a>). The case is like that of baptism among the barbarous nations, where no sooner was the king converted than a general order went forth for the baptism of his subjects, which no one thought of resisting. <span class="cmt_word">Then shall he eat thereof</span>. It was a principle of the Jewish law that the slaves should be admitted to complete religious equality with the native Israelites.
