These garments set Aaron and his sons apart for their priestly duties, symbolizing holiness and the need for purity when approaching God. The garments included the ephod, breastpiece, robe, tunic, turban, and sash, each with specific significance and symbolism.<p><b>whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It was the central place of worship and sacrifice, representing God's presence with His people. The priests' entry into this sacred space required them to be ritually clean and properly attired, emphasizing the holiness of God and the reverence required in His service.<p><b>or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place</b><br>The altar and the Holy Place were integral parts of the Tabernacle. The altar was used for sacrifices, which were central to the Israelites' worship and atonement for sin. The Holy Place contained the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altar of incense, each with its own symbolic meaning. The priests' ministry in these areas was a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice and His role as our High Priest, who intercedes for us before God.<p><b>so that they will not incur guilt and die</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of approaching God without the proper preparation and attire. The holiness of God demanded that those who served Him be consecrated and follow His commands precisely. Failure to do so could result in death, as seen in the cases of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). This highlights the gravity of sin and the need for atonement, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>This is to be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants</b><br>The command for the priests to wear these garments was not temporary but a lasting ordinance for Aaron's lineage. This established the Aaronic priesthood, which continued until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. The permanence of this statute points to the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel and foreshadows the eternal priesthood of Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament priestly system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

Literally," when they go into the tent of meeting - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the place where God and the high priest were to meet. <span class="cmt_word">The holy place</span>. The "holy place" seems in this passage to include the court of the tabernacle, wherein the altar was situated. <span class="cmt_word">That they bear not iniquity</span>. To "bear iniquity" is to incur guilt, or have sin imputed to one. If even through forgetfulness a priest entered the sanctuary without this necessary article of clothing, and so risked an unseemly, exposure of his person, he was to be accounted guilty, and punished by death. This was to be a "statute for ever," and to apply both to the high priest and the ordinary priests.
