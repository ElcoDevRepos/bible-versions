The priests, specifically Aaron and his sons, were to present offerings to God. This act of taking the offerings from their hands signifies the transfer of the offering from the people to God, mediated by the priests. It highlights the priestly function as intermediaries between God and the Israelites, a role that foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and burn them on the altar</b><br>Burning the offerings on the altar was a central part of the sacrificial ritual. The altar, located in the Tabernacle's courtyard, was the designated place for sacrifices. The act of burning symbolizes the complete dedication and surrender of the offering to God. This process of burning also signifies purification and atonement, as the fire consumes the offering, representing God's holiness and the need for sin to be dealt with.<p><b>atop the burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, was a foundational sacrifice in the Israelite worship system. It was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total devotion to God. Placing the other offerings atop the burnt offering indicates that all sacrifices are built upon the foundation of complete surrender to God. This can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, which is the foundation of our faith and relationship with God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>as a pleasing aroma before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "pleasing aroma" is a recurring motif in the Old Testament, signifying God's acceptance of the offering. It reflects the idea that the sacrifice, when offered in obedience and faith, is pleasing to God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), indicating divine satisfaction and acceptance.<p><b>it is a food offering to the LORD</b><br>The term "food offering" underscores the idea of the offering as sustenance, not for God in a literal sense, but as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment and fellowship. In the ancient Near Eastern context, sharing a meal was a sign of covenant and relationship. This offering symbolizes the covenant relationship between God and His people, pointing forward to the ultimate fellowship with God through Christ, who is the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is receiving instructions from God on how to consecrate Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, who are being consecrated for their service to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices are made to God, symbolizing His presence and the people's worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is giving these instructions to Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burnt_offering.htm">The Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice that is completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_sacrifice.htm">The Significance of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The act of burning offerings on the altar signifies complete devotion and surrender to God.
