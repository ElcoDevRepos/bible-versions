Bezalel, from the tribe of Judah, and Oholiab, from the tribe of Dan, represent the unity of Israel's tribes in this divine task. Their mention highlights the importance of God-given skills and talents in fulfilling His purposes. The inclusion of "every skilled person" emphasizes the communal effort and the diversity of gifts within the community, reflecting the New Testament teaching on the body of Christ in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>.<p><b>are to carry out everything commanded by the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions.

This obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the principle that God's work must be done in God's way.<p><b>who has given them skill and ability</b><br>The skills and abilities of Bezalel, Oholiab, and the other craftsmen are portrayed as gifts from God. This divine endowment is a reminder that all talents and abilities are ultimately sourced from God, as seen in <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>. It also reflects the biblical principle that God equips those He calls, as seen in the lives of figures like Moses and David.<p><b>to know how to perform all the work</b><br>The phrase indicates not just the possession of skill but the understanding and wisdom to apply it effectively. This mirrors the biblical concept of wisdom, which is more than knowledge; it is the practical application of knowledge in accordance with God's will. <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> states that the Lord gives wisdom, and this wisdom is essential for carrying out His work.<p><b>of constructing the sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary, or Tabernacle, was the dwelling place of God among His people, a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem.

The entire section is little more than a repetition of those chapters, differing from them merely in recording as done that which had in them been ordered to be done. The minute exactness of the repetition is very remarkable, and seems intended to teach the important lesson, that acceptable obedience consists in a complete and exact observance of God's commandments in all respects down to the minutest point.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3</span> and 8-38. - THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK, AND THE SUPERFLUOUS LIBERALITY OF THE PEOPLE - THE LATTER HAS TO BE RESTRAINED (vers. 3-7). Bezaleel and Aholiab felt that the time for action was now come. They at once addressed themselves to their task. Moses delivered into their hands all the various offerings which the people, rich and poor, had brought in (<a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>); and skilled workmen were immediately called upon to shape it for the designed uses. The fact of the work being commenced did not stop the inflow of gifts. More and yet more continued to be brought "every morning" (ver. 3). At last it became clear that the supply had exceeded the demand; and the workmen reported so to Moses (vers. 4, 5), who thereupon commanded that the offerings should cease (ver. 6). The progress of the work is then reported in detail, and in the following order: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The covering for the tabernacle (vers. 8-13); <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The goats' hair covering for the tent above the tabernacle (vers. 14-18);
