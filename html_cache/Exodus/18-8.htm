This relationship highlights the broader family ties within the ancient Near East. Moses' recounting to Jethro signifies the importance of sharing God's works with others, especially those outside the immediate covenant community, reflecting the evangelistic aspect of Israel's mission.<p><b>all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel&#8217;s sake</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over the mightiest empire of the time, Egypt. The plagues and the eventual Exodus were acts of divine judgment and deliverance, showcasing God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This narrative foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who conquers sin and death for the sake of His people.<p><b>all the hardships they had encountered along the way</b><br>The journey from Egypt to Sinai was fraught with challenges, including lack of water, food, and the threat of enemies like the Amalekites.
