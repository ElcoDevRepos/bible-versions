In the context of the Israelites, this stirring of the heart signifies a divine prompting, reflecting a willing and generous spirit. The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of one's being, including emotions and will. This mirrors the New Testament teaching in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where God loves a cheerful giver. The stirring of the heart can be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit's work in believers, prompting them to act according to God's will.<p><b>and whose spirit prompted him</b><br>The spirit here refers to the inner motivation and willingness to contribute to God's work. This phrase emphasizes the personal and spiritual nature of the offering, as opposed to a mere obligation. It suggests a deep, internal conviction, aligning with the idea that true worship and service to God must come from within. This can be connected to the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people, enabling them to follow His decrees.<p><b>came and brought an offering to the LORD</b><br>The act of bringing an offering signifies obedience and devotion to God. In the historical context, offerings were a central part of worship and covenant relationship with God. This act of giving is a precursor to the sacrificial system that would be fully realized in the person of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice. The offerings for the Tabernacle were tangible expressions of faith and commitment to God's covenant.<p><b>for the work on the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the portable sanctuary where God dwelled among His people. It was a central place of worship and symbolized God's presence and guidance. The construction of the Tabernacle was a communal effort, requiring the contributions and skills of the entire community. This foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church as the body of Christ, where each member contributes to the whole (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>for all its services</b><br>This phrase refers to the various functions and rituals performed in the Tabernacle, including sacrifices, offerings, and priestly duties. These services were essential for maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. They point forward to the ultimate service of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled and surpassed these rituals through His life, death, and resurrection, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>.<p><b>and for the holy garments</b><br>The holy garments were worn by the priests, particularly the high priest, and were essential for their service in the Tabernacle. These garments symbolized purity, holiness, and the special role of the priests as mediators between God and the people. The high priest's garments, especially, foreshadowed the role of Jesus Christ as our High Priest, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The detailed instructions for these garments underscore the importance of approaching God with reverence and purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Moses dismissed the people; but they soon began to return, bringing their offerings with them. There was a general, if not a universal, willingness Men and women alike "brought bracelets (brooches?), and earrings, and rings, and armlets - all articles of gold," and offered them to the Lord (ver. 22). Others brought blue and purple and scalier and fine linen, and goats' hair and rams' skins dyed red, and badger (or rather, seal) skins (ver. 23). Silver and bronze and shittimwood were contributed by others (ver. 24). The women, who were the only spinners, brought their spun yarn of blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen, and their yarn of goats' hair (vers. 25, 26); while the richest class of all - "the rulers" - gave, as their contribution, the onyx stones for the ephod, the jewels for the high-priest's breastplate, and the oil needed for the light, together with rare spices for the anointing ointment and the incense (vers. 27, 28).
