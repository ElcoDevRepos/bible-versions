The coupling from bottom to top signifies a strong, unified structure, symbolizing the unity and strength of God's covenant with Israel. The Tabernacle, as a whole, represents God's dwelling among His people, prefiguring the incarnation of Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The meticulous design reflects God's order and precision, emphasizing His holiness and the need for Israel to approach Him with reverence.<p><b>and fitted into a single ring</b><br>The use of a single ring to fit the boards together highlights the importance of unity and cohesion in the structure. This can be seen as a metaphor for the unity of the body of Christ, the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>. The ring ensures stability and integrity, much like the unity of believers ensures the strength and witness of the Church. The ring also signifies completeness and eternity, pointing to the eternal nature of God's covenant and His unending presence with His people.<p><b>These will serve as the two corners</b><br>The corners of the Tabernacle are crucial for its stability and form. In biblical symbolism, corners often represent strength and protection (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). The two corners here may also symbolize the dual nature of Christ as both divine and human, serving as the foundation of the faith. Additionally, the corners can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the cornerstone of the Church (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>), providing the essential support and alignment for the spiritual structure of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were instructed to build the Tabernacle as a place of worship during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among His people during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave Moses the instructions for the Tabernacle and the Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/precision_in_obedience.htm">Precision in Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle remind us of the importance of following God's commands precisely.

The same thorough, intentional workmanship appears in God&#8217;s later commands for the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>) and foreshadows how He binds His people &#8220;rooted and built up in Him&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Bottom-to-top coupling pictures a life anchored at its foundation (Christ&#8212;<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>) and aligned all the way to its highest point (seeking the things above&#8212;<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fitted into a single ring</b><p>&#8211; The phrase continues: &#8220;and fitted into a single ring.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A central ring linked the two boards so they did not twist or drift apart.

Literally, this guaranteed stability for the portable sanctuary. Spiritually, it showcases God&#8217;s meticulous care to unite and steady His dwelling&#8212;first the tent in the wilderness, ultimately His people in Christ&#8212;so that from foundation to pinnacle everything holds together in perfect strength and harmony.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">They shall be coupled together beneath.</span>--The corner boards were to be coupled to the others in two places, below and above, in each place by means of one ring.
