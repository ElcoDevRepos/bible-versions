The altars refer to the places of worship used by the Canaanites for their pagan rituals. The directive to tear them down underscores the importance of removing any temptation to idolatry and ensuring the purity of worship dedicated solely to Yahweh. This act symbolizes a complete rejection of Canaanite religious practices and a commitment to the covenant relationship with God. The destruction of altars is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the need for exclusive devotion to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>, <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>).<p><b>smash their sacred stones</b><br>Sacred stones, or "standing stones," were often used in Canaanite religious practices as symbols of deities or as memorials for significant events. The command to smash these stones highlights the need to eliminate any physical representation of false gods, which could lead the Israelites astray. This action is a physical demonstration of the spiritual warfare against idolatry and the need to uphold the holiness of God. The destruction of these stones is a reminder of the first and second commandments, which prohibit the worship of other gods and the making of idols (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>and chop down their Asherah poles</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the worship of the goddess Asherah, a prominent deity in the Canaanite pantheon. These poles were often placed near altars and were integral to fertility rites and other pagan ceremonies. The command to chop them down signifies the eradication of any influence that could corrupt the Israelites' worship of Yahweh. This act is not only about physical destruction but also about purifying the land from spiritual defilement. The removal of Asherah poles is echoed in the reforms of faithful kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who sought to restore true worship in Israel (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-14.htm">2 Kings 23:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the commandments from God on Mount Sinai.

God does not merely forbid alliance with pagan culture; He demands decisive separation (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>). The contrast is sharp: instead of blending in, Israel is called to active, visible holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must tear down their altars</b><p>Altars were the primary sites where Canaanites sacrificed to false gods. God orders Israel to dismantle them completely.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a> restates the same duty: &#8220;You must tear down their altars&#8230; burn their idols with fire.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gideon obeyed this command in miniature when he demolished Baal&#8217;s altar in <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>, proving that true worship of Yahweh cannot coexist with idolatry.<p>&#8226; King Josiah later did the same on a national scale (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12-15</a>).<p>God&#8217;s people must not tolerate neutral ground where false worship can be resurrected; every idol&#8217;s platform must be removed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Smash their sacred stones</b><p>&#8220;Sacred stones&#8221; (pillars) marked worship sites and memorialized pagan deities.

Now, after the Israelites had displayed their idolatrous leanings, it is added that they are likewise to destroy the "altars" and the "groves." Altars were common among all the idolatrous nations, sometimes attached to temples (<a href="/1_kings/16-32.htm" title="And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.">1Kings 16:32</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/21-4.htm" title="And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.">2Kings 21:4-5</a>), sometimes separate from them (<a href="/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.">Numbers 23:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.">Numbers 23:29</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10-11</a>), and were used for much the same purposes as the Hebrew altars: <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>for sacrifices, bloody and unbloody, and for burning incense. "Groves"--here mentioned for the first time--were peculiar to a limited number of nations, as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Ph?nicians, Syrians, and a few others. They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or stone, or both, imitative of vegetable forms, and probably emblematic of the productive powers of nature. The worship connected with the "groves" was of a peculiarly gross and licentious character. The very name, <span class= "ital">asherah, </span>was a modification of Ashtoreth, or Astarte. It is remarkable that nothing is said of destroying Canaannite temples--an indication that as yet they did not exist, and a mark of the high antiquity of the book. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall destroy their altars</span>, etc. This command is more sweeping than the corresponding one in the "Book of the Covenant" (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>), which expressly mentions only the "images." Here the destruction of idol-altars and idol-groves is further commanded. On idol-altars, see <a href="/numbers/23-1.htm">Numbers 23:1, 29</a>; <a href="/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Groves</span> are here for the first time mentioned. They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or metal, or both, more or less imitative of trees, and regarded as emblems of the Oriental nature-deities, especially Baal and Astarte or Ashtoreth. The word translated "grove" (<span class="accented">asherah</span>) is a modification of the name Ashtoreth.
