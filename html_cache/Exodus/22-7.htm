The cultural context emphasizes community trust and responsibility. The act of giving goods for safekeeping indicates a relationship of trust and mutual respect, which is foundational in a covenant community. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>and they are stolen from the neighbor&#8217;s house</b><br>The mention of theft from a neighbor's house highlights the vulnerability of personal property and the importance of community integrity. In ancient Israel, homes were not as secure as modern dwellings, making theft a significant concern. This situation underscores the need for laws to protect property and maintain social order. The commandment "You shall not steal" (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>) is directly related, emphasizing the moral and legal implications of theft.<p><b>the thief, if caught, must pay back double</b><br>This restitution principle serves as both a deterrent and a means of justice. The requirement to pay back double reflects the biblical concept of restitution, which goes beyond mere punishment to restore what was lost and compensate for the wrongdoing. This principle is seen in other parts of the Mosaic Law, such as in <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>, where restitution includes an additional fifth of the value. The idea of restitution is also a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He not only pays the penalty for sin but restores and reconciles believers to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_giver.htm">The Giver</a></b><br>The individual who entrusts money or goods to a neighbor for safekeeping.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbor.htm">The Neighbor</a></b><br>The person who receives the money or goods to keep them safe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thief.htm">The Thief</a></b><br>The individual who steals the entrusted money or goods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>The location where the goods or money are kept for safekeeping.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_restitution.htm">The Event of Restitution</a></b><br>The act of the thief repaying double if caught.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_trust_and_responsibility.htm">Principle of Trust and Responsibility</a></b><br>Trust is a foundational element in relationships.

Conversely the trustee required to be safe-guarded against incurring loss if the property intrusted to his care suffered damage or disappeared without fault of his. The Mosaic legislation provided for both cases. On the one hand, it required the trustee to exercise proper care, and made him answerable for the loss if a thing intrusted to him was stolen and the thief not found. Embezzlement it punished by requiring the trustee guilty of it to "pay double." On the other hand, in doubtful cases it allowed the trustee to clear himself by an oath (<a href="/exodus/22-10.htm" title="If a man deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:">Exodus 22:10</a>), and in clear cases to give proof that the loss had happened through unavoidable accident (<a href="/exodus/22-12.htm" title="And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner thereof.">Exodus 22:12</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep.</span>--The practice of making deposits of this kind was widespread among ancient communities, where there were no professional bankers or keepers of warehouses. The Greeks called such a deposit <span class= "greekheb">????????????</span><span class= "ital">. </span>It was usually made in money, or at any rate in the precious metals. A refusal to restore the thing deposited was very rare, since a special nemesis was considered to punish such conduct (Herod, vii. 86). However, at Athens it was found necessary to have a peculiar form of action for the recovery of deposits (<span class= "greekheb">????????????? ????</span>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-13.</span> - LAW OF DEPOSITS. - Deposition of property in the hands of a friend, to keep and guard, was a marked feature in the life of primitive societies, where investments were difficult, and bankers unknown. Persons about to travel, especially merchants, were wont to make such a disposition of the greater part of their movable property, which required some one to guard it in their absence. Refusals to return such deposits were rare; since ancient morality regarded such refusal as a crime of deep dye (Herod. 7:86). Sometimes, however, they took place; and at Athens there was a special form of action which might be brought in such cases called <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>.
