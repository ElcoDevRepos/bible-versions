Jethro, a Midianite priest, offers advice on leadership and delegation. This interaction highlights the importance of seeking counsel and valuing wisdom from others, regardless of their background. The relationship between Moses and Jethro also underscores the significance of family ties and respect for elders, which is a recurring theme in biblical texts (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>, <a href="/proverbs/19-20.htm">Proverbs 19:20</a>).<p><b>and did everything he said.</b><br>Moses' obedience to Jethro's advice reflects his willingness to implement practical solutions for the well-being of the Israelites. This action demonstrates effective leadership and the ability to adapt, qualities that are essential for guiding a large community. The implementation of Jethro's advice leads to the establishment of a judicial system, which is a precursor to the more formalized legal structures found later in the Torah. This decision also foreshadows the delegation of responsibilities seen in the New Testament, such as the appointment of deacons in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>.
