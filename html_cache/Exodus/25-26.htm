Gold, a precious metal, symbolizes purity, divinity, and kingship, often associated with God's holiness and glory. The use of gold in the Tabernacle reflects the heavenly reality it represents, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described as being made of pure gold. The table, known as the Table of Showbread, held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and fellowship with His people. The rings were functional, allowing the table to be carried with poles, emphasizing the mobility of the Israelites and God's presence with them during their journey.<p><b>and fasten them to the four corners</b><br>The placement of the rings at the four corners of the table indicates stability and balance, ensuring that the table could be securely carried. The number four often represents universality or completeness in the Bible, as seen in the four corners of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). This could symbolize the comprehensive nature of God's provision and presence, extending to all aspects of life. The corners also suggest a sense of order and structure, reflecting God's orderly nature in creation and His instructions for worship.<p><b>at its four legs</b><br>The mention of the table's four legs highlights its practical design, ensuring it stands firm and stable. The legs support the table, just as God's promises and covenant support His people. The table's design, including its legs, was divinely ordained, emphasizing that every detail in the Tabernacle had spiritual significance. The legs also allowed the table to be elevated, signifying the elevation of God's provision and the sacredness of the offerings placed upon it. This elevation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is lifted up as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), providing spiritual sustenance and eternal life to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were to construct the Tabernacle as a place of worship and dwelling for God's presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that the Israelites built according to God's instructions, serving as a place of worship during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Law and the instructions for the Tabernacle from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle, including the gold rings, emphasize the importance of following God's commands precisely.
