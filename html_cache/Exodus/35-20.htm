The term "congregation" emphasizes the unity and collective identity of the people as God's chosen nation. Historically, this gathering would have included men, women, and possibly children, all of whom were part of the covenant community. The Israelites were camped at the base of Mount Sinai during this period, having been delivered from Egypt and receiving the Law from God. This collective action underscores the communal nature of their faith and obedience.<p><b>withdrew from the presence of Moses.</b><br>Moses served as the mediator between God and the Israelites, often conveying God's commands and instructions to the people. The act of withdrawing indicates that the people had received a message or command from Moses and were now leaving to act upon it. This moment follows Moses' instructions regarding the construction of the Tabernacle, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The withdrawal signifies their readiness to contribute materials and skills for the Tabernacle's construction, demonstrating their obedience and willingness to participate in God's plan. This action can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of the church as the body of Christ, where each member contributes to the whole.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness.
