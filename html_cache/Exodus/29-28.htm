Aaron and his sons, representing the Levitical priesthood, are set apart for service to God. This provision underscores the principle that those who serve at the altar should share in the offerings (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>). The priesthood of Aaron is a type of Christ's eternal priesthood, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where Jesus is described as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek.<p><b>as a regular portion from the Israelites</b><br>The term "regular portion" indicates a perpetual statute, emphasizing the ongoing support for the priesthood. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the people are responsible for sustaining the spiritual leaders. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to support those who teach the Word (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>).<p><b>for it is the heave offering</b><br>The heave offering, a specific type of offering, involved lifting a portion of the sacrifice as a symbolic gesture of presenting it to God. This act of elevation signifies the offering's dedication to the Lord. The heave offering is part of the broader sacrificial system that points to Christ's ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>the Israelites will make to the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal aspect of worship, where the entire nation participates in offerings to God. It reflects the covenantal identity of Israel as a people set apart for God's purposes. The collective responsibility of the Israelites to make offerings underscores the unity and shared faith of the community, a theme that resonates with the New Testament church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>from their peace offerings</b><br>Peace offerings, also known as fellowship offerings, were voluntary sacrifices expressing gratitude and communion with God. They symbolize reconciliation and fellowship, themes central to the New Testament message of peace with God through Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).
