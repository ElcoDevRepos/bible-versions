This reflects the inclusive nature of worship and service in the community of Israel. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, this joint participation underscores the unity and shared responsibility among the people of God. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither male nor female, but all are one (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>whose hearts prompted them</b><br>The phrase indicates a voluntary and heartfelt response, not one compelled by obligation. This reflects the biblical principle that God values offerings given willingly and cheerfully (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). The prompting of the heart suggests the work of the Holy Spirit, who moves individuals to act according to God's will. This voluntary spirit is a precursor to the New Covenant, where the law is written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>brought a freewill offering to the LORD</b><br>A freewill offering is one that is given voluntarily, beyond what is required by law. This type of offering is significant in that it demonstrates the Israelites' devotion and gratitude to God. It is an act of worship and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision. The concept of freewill offerings is seen throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>for all the work that the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do</b><br>This phrase refers to the construction of the Tabernacle, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The work commanded by the LORD through Moses included detailed instructions for building the Tabernacle and its furnishings, as outlined in earlier chapters of Exodus. This obedience to God's command is a demonstration of faith and trust in His plan. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, symbolizing God's presence among His people, and foreshadowing the incarnation of Jesus, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egypt and to communicate God's laws and instructions to them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who commanded the construction of the Tabernacle as a dwelling place among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that God instructed the Israelites to build as a place of worship and His dwelling among them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/freewill_offering.htm">Freewill Offering</a></b><br>Voluntary contributions made by the Israelites, motivated by a willing heart, for the construction of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/willing_hearts_in_service.htm">Willing Hearts in Service</a></b><br>The emphasis on "willing hearts" in <a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a> teaches us that God values the attitude and motivation behind our giving and service.
