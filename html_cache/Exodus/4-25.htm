The use of a flint knife is significant as it reflects ancient practices; flint was commonly used for circumcision in the ancient Near East due to its sharpness and availability. This act indicates a return to the covenantal practice commanded by God to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's covenant.<p><b>cut off her son&#8217;s foreskin</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants. The act of circumcision here is crucial as it signifies inclusion in the covenant community. The urgency of the act suggests that Moses had neglected this important covenantal sign, which was necessary for his son to be part of God's chosen people. This neglect could have been due to Moses' time in Midian, where such practices might not have been observed.<p><b>and touched it to Moses&#8217; feet</b><br>The phrase "touched it to Moses&#8217; feet" is subject to various interpretations. Some scholars suggest that "feet" is a euphemism for genitals, indicating a symbolic act of transferring the covenantal sign to Moses. This act may represent Zipporah's intercession, averting God's wrath from Moses by fulfilling the covenantal requirement. It underscores the seriousness of covenantal obedience and the role of intercession.<p><b>&#8220;Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,&#8221; she said.</b><br>Zipporah's statement, "a bridegroom of blood," reflects the gravity and the life-and-death nature of the covenant. The term "bridegroom of blood" may indicate the cost of entering into a covenant relationship with God, which often involves sacrifice and bloodshed, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. This phrase also highlights the tension between cultural practices and divine mandates, as Zipporah, a Midianite, is confronted with the Hebrew covenantal requirement. The blood signifies purification and consecration, themes that are central to the sacrificial system and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the ultimate bridegroom who shed His blood for the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zipporah.htm">Zipporah</a></b><br>The wife of Moses, daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest.

An uncircumcised male was to be &#8220;cut off from his people&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>), so God&#8217;s threat to Moses is completely consistent with His word.<p>&#8226; By performing the rite herself, Zipporah shows that obedience sometimes requires stepping into an uncomfortable role (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18-19</a> where Abigail acts decisively to prevent judgment).<p>&#8226; The cutting of flesh points to the costliness of covenant: blood must be shed (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> echoes this truth throughout Scripture).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and touched it to Moses&#8217; feet</b><p>&#8226; The touch applies covenant blood to the one under threat, paralleling the Passover lamb&#8217;s blood applied to doorframes in <a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a> to avert judgment.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Feet&#8221; often symbolize the whole person (<a href="/ruth/3-4.htm">Ruth 3:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a> where a coal touches the prophet&#8217;s lips); thus Zipporah symbolically covers Moses with atoning blood.<p>&#8226; This act satisfies God&#8217;s righteous requirement, and verse 26 reports, &#8220;So the LORD let him alone.&#8221; The sequence foreshadows Christ&#8217;s blood, which later covers believers completely (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,&#8221; she said</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Bridegroom&#8221; recalls the marriage covenant; Zipporah realizes that her union with Moses now hinges on blood covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Her words mix relief and reproach: relief that Moses&#8217; life is spared, and reproach that the cost was so high (similar tension in <a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a> where Joseph&#8217;s brothers feel guilt yet recognize deliverance).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/4-26.htm">Exodus 4:26</a> states she repeated the phrase, emphasizing how the episode etched covenant realities into their family memory, much like Israel would annually remember Passover.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25</a> displays the life-or-death seriousness of covenant obedience. Moses, destined to lead Israel, first had to align his household with God&#8217;s command. Zipporah&#8217;s quick, costly action applied covenant blood, shielding Moses from divine judgment and underscoring that deliverance always involves shed blood. The episode prepares readers for the broader Exodus story&#8212;where obedience, blood, and deliverance intertwine&#8212;culminating finally in the perfect Bridegroom whose blood secures an everlasting covenant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">A sharp stone.--</span>On the use of stone knives by the Egyptian <span class= "ital">paraschist?</span> see Herod. ii. 86.

Literally "a stone." Stone knives were commonly used in Egypt for making the incisions necessary when bodies were embalmed, and were regarded as purer than iron or bronze ones. Joshua ordered the preparation of stone knives for the circumcision of those born in the wilderness (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>); and the Jews seem to have used stone for circumcision for many ages, though before the compilation of the Talmud they had changed their practice. Cast it at his feet. Not, certainly, the child's feet, but her husband's, to whom at the same moment she addresses herself. A bloody husband. Literally, "a bridegroom of blood." The words are clearly a reproach; and the gist of the reproach seems to be that Moses was a husband who cost her dear, causing the blood of her sons to be shed in order to keep up a national usage which she regarded as barbarous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Zipporah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ip&#183;p&#333;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6855.htm">Strong's 6855: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zipporah -- 'bird', Moses' wife</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
