The laver was made of bronze and filled with water, serving as a place for ceremonial washing. This act of washing symbolizes purification and readiness to serve God, emphasizing the importance of holiness and cleanliness in worship.<p><b>Moses, Aaron, and his sons</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet, and Aaron, the high priest, along with his sons, who served as priests, were the primary figures responsible for the spiritual leadership and rituals of Israel. Their roles were crucial in mediating between God and the people. This highlights the importance of leadership in maintaining the covenant relationship with God. Aaron and his sons' priestly duties foreshadow the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates the new covenant.<p><b>washed their hands and feet</b><br>The act of washing hands and feet was a requirement for the priests before they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19-21</a>. This ritual cleansing was a physical representation of spiritual purity and readiness to perform sacred duties. It underscores the necessity of approaching God with reverence and purity, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>.
