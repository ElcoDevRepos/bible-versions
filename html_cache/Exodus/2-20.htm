It reflects the hospitality customs of the ancient Near East, where welcoming strangers was a significant cultural practice. The inquiry shows concern and curiosity about Moses, who had helped his daughters at the well. This moment foreshadows Moses' future integration into Jethro's family and the Midianite community.<p><b>their father asked.</b><br>Reuel's role as the father of the seven daughters highlights the patriarchal structure of the family unit during this period. As the head of the household, he is responsible for the well-being and decisions concerning his family. This interaction sets the stage for Moses' eventual marriage to Zipporah, one of Reuel's daughters, and his time in Midian, which becomes a formative period in his life.<p><b>Why did you leave the man behind?</b><br>This question underscores the expectation of hospitality and gratitude. In the cultural context, it would have been customary to invite a benefactor into one's home as a gesture of thanks and to establish a relationship. The daughters' initial oversight in not inviting Moses reflects their surprise and urgency in returning home, but also sets up the opportunity for Moses to be welcomed into their family.<p><b>Invite him to have something to eat.</b><br>Sharing a meal was a significant act of fellowship and acceptance in ancient cultures. It symbolized peace, friendship, and the beginning of a relationship. This invitation not only provides Moses with sustenance but also marks the beginning of his integration into the Midianite community. This act of hospitality is reminiscent of other biblical instances where sharing a meal signifies covenant and community, such as Abraham's hospitality to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. Moses' acceptance of this invitation leads to his eventual role as a shepherd in Midian, a period of preparation for his future leadership of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>At this point in the account, Moses has fled Egypt after killing an Egyptian and has arrived in Midian.
