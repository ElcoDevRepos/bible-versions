This summoning indicates a direct confrontation between the ruler of Egypt and the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine figures, and their commands were expected to be obeyed without question. The midwives' actions demonstrate civil disobedience in the face of unjust laws, highlighting a theme of faithfulness to God over earthly authority. This moment foreshadows the later defiance of Moses against Pharaoh.<p><b>and asked them,</b><br>The act of questioning the midwives shows Pharaoh's frustration and disbelief. In the ancient Near East, midwives held a crucial role in society, often respected for their skills and wisdom. This interrogation suggests that Pharaoh underestimated the resolve and faith of these women. The midwives' courage is reminiscent of other biblical figures who stood firm in their faith, such as Daniel in the lion's den.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you done this?</b><br>Pharaoh's question reveals his expectation of obedience and his surprise at their defiance. This phrase underscores the moral dilemma faced by the midwives, who chose to fear God rather than man. Their actions align with the biblical principle found in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, where Peter and the apostles declare, "We must obey God rather than men." The midwives' decision reflects a deep trust in God's sovereignty and protection.<p><b>Why have you let the boys live?&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's concern with the survival of the Hebrew boys highlights his fear of the growing Israelite population, which he perceived as a threat to his power. This fear led to his genocidal decree, reminiscent of Herod's massacre of the innocents in <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>, which sought to eliminate Jesus, the prophesied King. The preservation of the Hebrew boys, particularly Moses, who would later lead the Israelites out of Egypt, serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the deliverance and salvation brought by Jesus. The midwives' actions contribute to God's redemptive plan, demonstrating His providence and the triumph of His purposes over human schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who felt threatened by the growing population of the Israelites and ordered the Hebrew midwives to kill all newborn Hebrew boys.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_midwives.htm">Hebrew Midwives</a></b><br>Specifically, Shiphrah and Puah, who were ordered by Pharaoh to kill the male Hebrew infants but feared God and did not comply.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites_in_egypt.htm">Israelites in Egypt</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob who were living in Egypt and had grown numerous, causing concern for Pharaoh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were living in bondage and where the events of <a href="/bsb/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1</a> take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority whom the Hebrew midwives feared and obeyed over Pharaoh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_god_over_fear_of_man.htm">Fear of God Over Fear of Man</a></b><br>The Hebrew midwives demonstrate the importance of fearing God above human authorities.
