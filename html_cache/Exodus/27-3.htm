In the context of the tabernacle, bronze symbolizes judgment and endurance. The use of bronze for the altar's utensils signifies the enduring nature of God's judgment and the need for purification. This metal's presence in the tabernacle contrasts with the gold used in the Holy of Holies, indicating a transition from judgment to divine presence.<p><b>its pots for removing ashes,</b><br>The pots were essential for maintaining the altar's cleanliness, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity. Ashes, the remnants of burnt offerings, represent the consumed sin offering. The act of removing ashes signifies the continual need for cleansing and renewal, pointing to the ultimate cleansing through Christ's sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.<p><b>its shovels,</b><br>Shovels were used to handle the ashes and coals, emphasizing the practical aspects of worship and the need for order in the sacrificial system.

This highlights the importance of reverence and care in handling holy things.

This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>, where the prayers of the saints are symbolized by incense.
