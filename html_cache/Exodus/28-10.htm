The high priest's breastplate, or ephod, was adorned with two onyx stones on the shoulders, each engraved with the names of six tribes. This symbolizes the priest bearing the people before God, highlighting the intercessory role of the priesthood. The use of stones for engraving is consistent with ancient Near Eastern practices, where stones were often used for recording important information due to their durability.<p><b>and the remaining six on the other</b><br>The division of the names into two groups of six on separate stones signifies completeness and balance, representing the entirety of the Israelite community. This division also reflects the organizational structure of the tribes as they camped and traveled, often grouped in specific formations. The high priest carrying these stones signifies the unity and collective identity of the tribes before God.<p><b>in the order of their birth</b><br>The order of birth is significant as it reflects the patriarchal lineage and the historical narrative of the sons of Jacob, who became the twelve tribes of Israel. This order is a reminder of the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their fulfillment through their descendants. The birth order also emphasizes the historical and familial continuity of God's chosen people, linking back to Genesis and the foundational stories of the Israelite identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
