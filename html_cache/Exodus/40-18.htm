The tabernacle, also known as the "Tent of Meeting," served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It symbolizes God's desire to dwell with His people, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament with the incarnation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The act of setting up the tabernacle signifies obedience to God's detailed instructions and the beginning of a new phase in Israel's relationship with God.<p><b>he laid its bases</b><br>The bases, or sockets, were made of silver and served as the foundation for the tabernacle's structure (<a href="/exodus/26-19.htm">Exodus 26:19</a>). Silver in the Bible often symbolizes redemption, as seen in the silver shekels used for the atonement money (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>). The solid foundation of the tabernacle can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the foundation of the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p><b>positioned its frames</b><br>The frames, or boards, were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (<a href="/exodus/26-15.htm">Exodus 26:15-30</a>). Acacia wood is known for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing the incorruptible nature of Christ. The gold overlay represents His divinity. The positioning of the frames indicates the careful and precise nature of God's instructions, reflecting His order and holiness.<p><b>inserted its crossbars</b><br>The crossbars provided stability and unity to the structure of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26-28</a>). They can be seen as a symbol of the unity and strength found in the body of Christ, the Church. Just as the crossbars held the frames together, the Holy Spirit unites believers in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-4</a>).<p><b>and set up its posts</b><br>The posts were essential for supporting the curtains and the overall structure of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-32.htm">Exodus 26:32-37</a>). They represent the support and strength provided by God to His people. In a broader sense, the posts can be seen as a type of the apostles and prophets, who are foundational to the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The setting up of the posts signifies the completion and readiness of the tabernacle for worship and the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.

God had already declared, &#8220;Then I will dwell among the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>), so Moses&#8217; action is an act of faith and obedience that invites God&#8217;s promised presence. The timing&#8212;&#8220;on the first day of the first month&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-2.htm">Exodus 40:2</a>)&#8212;signals a new beginning for the nation, similar to how God later ties new seasons to completed works (<a href="/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He laid its bases</b><p>The bases were solid silver sockets into which the frames would stand (<a href="/exodus/26-19.htm">Exodus 26:19</a>; 36:24). By laying the bases first, Moses provided a firm, level foundation&#8212;a vivid picture of how God Himself is the believer&#8217;s &#8220;Rock&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The order matters: foundation precedes structure, just as doctrine precedes practice (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Each base was made from the redemption silver collected during the census (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>; 38:25-27), reminding Israel that God&#8217;s dwelling rests on a redeemed people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Positioned its frames</b><p>Frames (or boards) formed the walls (<a href="/exodus/26-15.htm">Exodus 26:15-17</a>). Moses &#8220;positioned&#8221; them exactly as God had shown him on the mountain (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>). Precise placement taught Israel that God&#8217;s worship is not improvised but revealed (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>). As those frames stood shoulder to shoulder, they pictured believers &#8220;being built together into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Inserted its crossbars</b><p>Crossbars ran through gold-plated rings to hold the frames tightly together (<a href="/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26-29</a>). Unity was literally built in. In the same way, God binds His people in covenant love (<a href="/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>). Without the crossbars, isolated boards would topple; with them, the structure stood strong&#8212;a reminder that &#8220;two are better than one&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>) and that the church is called to &#8220;maintain the unity of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Set up its posts</b><p>The posts supported the curtain entrance (<a href="/exodus/26-37.htm">Exodus 26:37</a>) and the inner veil (<a href="/exodus/26-32.htm">Exodus 26:32-33</a>). By setting them up, Moses prepared the place where sacrifices and intercession would occur (<a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6-7</a>). The posts held up the fabric that both invited and limited access&#8212;inviting because God was near, limiting because sin still separated (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). Ultimately, Christ would tear that veil (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), granting full, confident entry (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/40-18.htm">Exodus 40:18</a> shows Moses carefully following the Lord&#8217;s blueprint, moving from foundation to framework to finishing supports. Each step underscores obedience, order, unity, and redemption. The tabernacle&#8217;s construction points forward to Christ and His church, where God now dwells not in tents made by hands but in hearts made new by His Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Moses . . . fastened his sockets.</span>--The stability of the Tabernacle must have depended almost entirely upon the sockets.
