The term "congregation" refers to the assembly of the people of Israel, highlighting their identity as a chosen nation. This collective identity is significant throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel is called a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The unity of the congregation is also a precursor to the New Testament concept of the Church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>must celebrate it</b><br>The command to celebrate refers to the observance of the Passover, a pivotal event in Israel's history marking their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. This celebration is not optional but a divine mandate, underscoring its importance in the life of the Israelites. The Passover is a type of Christ, as it foreshadows Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The requirement for all to participate points to the inclusivity of God's salvation plan, later expanded to all nations through Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The celebration involves specific rituals and practices, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, which serve as a remembrance of God's deliverance and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the entire community of the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were living in Egypt at the time of the Exodus.
