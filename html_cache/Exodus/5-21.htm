In the context of ancient Israel, invoking the LORD's judgment was a serious matter, indicating that the foremen felt deeply wronged. The foremen were likely Israelites appointed by the Egyptians to oversee their fellow Hebrews. Their plea for divine judgment suggests they believed Moses and Aaron had acted wrongly by confronting Pharaoh, leading to increased burdens on the Israelites. This reflects a common biblical theme where leaders are held accountable before God for their actions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3-5</a>, where Samuel calls upon the LORD to witness his integrity.<p><b>&#8220;the foremen said,&#8221;</b><br>The foremen were intermediaries between the Egyptian taskmasters and the Hebrew slaves. Their role was crucial in maintaining order and ensuring the completion of labor. Historically, this reflects the Egyptian practice of using local leaders to manage labor forces, a method that allowed for more efficient control over large groups of people. The foremen's position was precarious, as they were caught between the demands of the Egyptians and the suffering of their own people.<p><b>&#8220;for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials;&#8221;</b><br>The metaphor of being a "stench" indicates a severe loss of favor and respect. In the ancient Near East, maintaining honor and avoiding shame were vital cultural values. The foremen's complaint suggests that Moses and Aaron's actions had brought disgrace upon the Israelites, making them detestable to Pharaoh and his court. This echoes the broader biblical narrative where God's people often face scorn and rejection from worldly powers, as seen in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>, where Jesus speaks of the world's hatred for His followers.<p><b>&#8220;you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!&#8221;</b><br>This hyperbolic expression underscores the perceived danger and increased oppression resulting from Moses and Aaron's confrontation with Pharaoh. The "sword" symbolizes the power and authority of the Egyptians to inflict harm. Historically, the Israelites were already under harsh conditions, but the demand to produce bricks without straw (<a href="/exodus/5-7.htm">Exodus 5:7-8</a>) intensified their suffering. This situation foreshadows the deliverance theme in Exodus, where God ultimately rescues His people from bondage, prefiguring the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Now hardship tempts them to view their deliverers as culprits.<p>- Yet Scripture presents the plea literally&#8212;God does see (<a href="/exodus/2-25.htm">Exodus 2:25</a>) and will indeed judge, vindicating His plan despite their frustration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the foremen said</b><p>- These overseers had just been beaten for failing to meet brick quotas (<a href="/exodus/5-14.htm">Exodus 5:14</a>). Their firsthand suffering gives weight to their protest.<p>- Their conversation with Moses happens &#8220;as they were leaving Pharaoh&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20</a>), illustrating how quickly emotional wounds can overflow into accusations.<p>- Like Job&#8217;s friends (<a href="/job/19-2.htm">Job 19:2</a>), they speak out of pain, reminding us that suffering often shapes speech more than sound theology.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials</b><p>- &#8220;A stench&#8221; conveys being detestable or loathsome, similar to Jacob&#8217;s complaint &#8220;You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the inhabitants of the land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>).<p>- Pharaoh now views Israel as rebellious, not oppressed.

What seems like a disastrous setback is the very road God uses to magnify His glory (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The foremen&#8217;s outburst captures the tension between immediate suffering and God&#8217;s promised salvation. They beg the LORD to judge Moses, blame him for worsening their reputation with Pharaoh, and fear fatal consequences. Scripture records their complaint honestly, yet the narrative soon proves that God has indeed &#8220;looked upon&#8221; His people and will judge Egypt, not Israel. Their cry of despair is real, but so is God&#8217;s faithful deliverance that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Ye have made our savour to be abhorred.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">to stink.</span> An idiom common to the Hebrews with the Egyptians (Comp. <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm" title="And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-4.htm" title="And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines.

The officers may have feared that their inability to enforce the Pharaoh's impracticable demands would ultimately lead to their execution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said unto them</span>. The officers were too full of their wrongs to wait until questioned. They took the word, and, without relating the result of their interview, implied it. The Lord look upon you, and judge, they said, meaning "the Lord (Jehovah) consider your conduct, and judge it" not exactly, "condemn it and punish it" (Keil and Delitzsch) - but "pass sentence on it," "judge whether it has been right or not." We make this appeal because ye have at any rate done us a great injury - ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh. (Note the mixed metaphor, which shows- perhaps rather that "in the eyes" had lost its original meaning, and come to signify no more than "with" or "in respect of," than that the literal meaning of making a person's savour to "stink" did not occur to the writer.) Nay, ye have done more - ye have put a sword in the hand of his servants to slay us. That is to say, "ye have armed them with a weapon wherewith we expect that they will take our lives." Either they will beat us to death - and death is a not infrequent result of a repeated employment of the bastinado - or when they find that punishment unavailing they will execute us as traitors. On the use of the bastinado as a punishment in Egypt, see Chabas, 'Melanges Egyptologiques,' 3me serie, vol. 1. pp. 100-6. <p> CHAPTER 5:22, 23 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;May the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">look upon you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1447;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;re)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and judge you,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yi&#353;&#183;p&#333;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
