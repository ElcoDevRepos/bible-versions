Blue dye was often derived from the murex snail, while purple was a symbol of royalty and wealth. Scarlet, a vivid red, was also a costly dye. Fine linen was a luxury fabric, often associated with purity and righteousness. These materials were used in the construction of the Tabernacle, symbolizing the beauty and holiness of God's dwelling place. The use of these colors and materials is echoed in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.<p><b>goat hair</b><br>Goat hair was a common material in the ancient world, used for making tents and garments due to its durability and availability. In the context of the Tabernacle, goat hair was used for the tent covering, providing protection and insulation. This practical material highlights the provision and care of God for His people, ensuring that His dwelling place was both beautiful and functional.<p><b>ram skins dyed red</b><br>Ram skins dyed red were used as an outer covering for the Tabernacle, symbolizing sacrifice and atonement. The red dye likely came from natural sources such as madder root or insects like the kermes. The ram, often associated with sacrifice (as seen in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a> with Abraham and Isaac), points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>or articles of fine leather</b><br>Fine leather, possibly referring to the hides of sea cows or other durable animals, was used for the outermost covering of the Tabernacle. This provided additional protection from the elements. The use of leather signifies the strength and resilience of God's covenant with His people, enduring through time and adversity.<p><b>brought them</b><br>The act of bringing these materials was a voluntary offering from the Israelites, demonstrating their willingness to contribute to the work of God. This communal effort reflects the principle of giving found in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where God loves a cheerful giver.
