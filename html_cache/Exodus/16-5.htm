In the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, this instruction highlights the importance of the Sabbath as a day of rest, as established in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>. The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>), emphasizing rest and reliance on God's provision.<p><b>when they prepare what they bring in</b><br>This preparation involved gathering and preparing the manna, the miraculous bread from heaven provided by God. The act of preparation underscores the need for human responsibility in cooperation with divine provision. It also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where food preparation was a daily task, and highlights the importance of planning and foresight in accordance with God's commands.<p><b>it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.</b><br>The doubling of the manna on the sixth day was a miraculous provision to ensure that the Israelites had enough food for the Sabbath without needing to gather it, thus observing the day of rest. This provision is a testament to God's faithfulness and care for His people. It also prefigures the concept of spiritual sustenance and rest found in Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The double portion can be seen as a type of the abundant life promised in Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>), and it foreshadows the eternal rest believers will enter (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The verse underscores God&#8217;s orderly provision, calls for intentional preparation, and demonstrates His sufficiency when His people follow His rhythms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">On</span> <span class= "bld">the sixth day</span>--i.e., <span class= "ital">the sixth day after the first giving of the manna </span>(Kalisch). Although in Babylonia, from a time certainly earlier than the Exodus, a Sabbath was observed on the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-eighth day of each month (Sayce: <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. vii., pp. 157-167), yet we have no evidence that the year was divided into weeks, much less that the several days of the week were known as the first, second, third, fourth, &c. In Egypt, the week of seven days was at this time unknown.<p><span class= "bld">They shall prepare.</span>--<span class= "bld">On </span>the method of preparation see <a href="/numbers/11-8.htm" title="And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.">Numbers 11:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">It shall be twice as much.</span>--Some suppose this to be a command--"Ye shall gather twice as much;" but it is more natural to take it as an announcement of a fact--"You will find that what you have gathered turns out to be twice as much." (So Kurtz, Kalisch, and Knobel.) A miraculous doubling of the quantity seems to be intended. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.">Exodus 16:22</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the sixth day</span>. That a period of seven days was known to the Hebrews as a week appears from the story of Jacob and Laban (<a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>). But there is no distinct evidence that the year was as yet divided into weeks, much less that the several days of the week were as yet distinguished as the first, second, third day, etc. "The sixth day," here probably means (as Kalisch says), "the sixth day after' the first supply of the manna. <span class="cmt_word">They shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">prepare</span>. The preparation would be, first, by measurement (ver. 18), and then by pounding and grinding (<a href="/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be double</span>. Some commentators suppose that in these words is implied an order that on the sixth day they should set themselves to gather a double quantity. But the natural meaning of the words is, that, having gathered the usual quantity, they should find, when they measured it, that, by miracle, the supply sufficient for one day was multiplied, so as to suffice for two. (So Kalisch, Knobel, Kurtz, and others.) This view is in harmony with verse 18, which tells of a miraculous expansion and diminution of the manna after it had been gathered, and with verse 22, which shows us "the rulers" surmised by the miracle of the sixth day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
