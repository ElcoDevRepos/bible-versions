Leaven, or yeast, is often symbolic of sin and corruption in the Bible (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The removal of leaven from the home represents the purging of sin from one's life. Historically, leaven was a small piece of dough left over from the previous batch, which would ferment and cause the new dough to rise. This process can symbolize how sin, if left unchecked, can permeate and affect the whole community or individual. The prohibition against leaven during this time underscores the need for purity and holiness as the Israelites prepared to leave Egypt, a land of idolatry and sin.<p><b>eat unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread, or matzah, is bread made without yeast, symbolizing purity and the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>). It is a reminder of their affliction and the urgency of their departure. In the New Testament, unleavened bread is also seen as a type of Christ, who is sinless and pure (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The consumption of unleavened bread during this feast is a call to remember God's deliverance and to live a life free from the corruption of sin.<p><b>in all your homes.&#8221;</b><br>The command to eat unleavened bread in all homes emphasizes the communal and familial aspect of the observance. It was not just a public or temple ritual but a practice to be observed within the household, signifying that the remembrance of God's deliverance and the call to holiness is personal and affects every aspect of life. This practice would have united the community in shared faith and obedience, reinforcing their identity as God's chosen people. The home-centered observance also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that faith and worship are not confined to a specific place but are to be lived out in daily life (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
