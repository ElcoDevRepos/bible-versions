The courtyard was an enclosed area surrounding the Tabernacle, providing a space for the congregation to gather and for the priests to perform their duties. This construction reflects the order and precision God commanded for His dwelling place, emphasizing the importance of holiness and separation from the common world. The courtyard's design also foreshadows the separation between God and humanity due to sin, which is ultimately reconciled through Jesus Christ.<p><b>The south side of the courtyard was a hundred cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, the south side of the courtyard measured approximately 150 feet or 45 meters. This specific measurement highlights the grandeur and significance of the Tabernacle as a place of worship. The precise dimensions underscore the importance of following God's instructions meticulously, as seen throughout the construction of the Tabernacle. This attention to detail is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law and the prophets with precision.<p><b>and had curtains of finely spun linen</b><br>The use of finely spun linen for the curtains signifies purity and righteousness, qualities that are essential for approaching a holy God. Linen was a valuable material, often associated with wealth and status, and its use in the Tabernacle indicates the reverence and honor due to God. The curtains served as a barrier, symbolizing the separation between the holy and the profane. In the New Testament, the tearing of the temple veil at Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) signifies the removal of this barrier, granting believers direct access to God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the courtyard.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>An integral part of the Tabernacle, serving as the outer area where the Israelites could come to worship and offer sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the instructions for building the Tabernacle as a place of worship and meeting with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for the construction of the Tabernacle, representing a place of testing and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle courtyard demonstrates the importance of following God's specific instructions.
