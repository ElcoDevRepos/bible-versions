Dew in the Bible often symbolizes divine blessing and provision (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>, <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>). The timing of the manna's appearance, after the dew evaporated, underscores the daily dependence on God for sustenance, reflecting the Israelites' need to trust in God's provision each day. This daily provision is echoed in the Lord's Prayer, "Give us this day our daily bread" (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p><b>there were thin flakes on the desert floor</b><br>The description of "thin flakes" suggests something delicate and unexpected, emphasizing the miraculous nature of manna. The desert, typically a place of scarcity, becomes a site of divine abundance. This transformation highlights God's power to provide in seemingly impossible circumstances. The desert setting also serves as a testing ground for the Israelites' faith and obedience, as they learn to rely on God's instructions for gathering manna (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-5</a>).<p><b>as fine as frost on the ground</b><br>The comparison to frost suggests a light, delicate substance, emphasizing the unique and supernatural quality of manna. Frost, which appears overnight and is temporary, parallels the daily provision and perishability of manna, which could not be stored for the next day except before the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/16-19.htm">Exodus 16:19-20, 23</a>-24). This imagery also points to the purity and freshness of God's provision.

There are two natural substances, quite distinct, with which it has been compared, and by some persons identified. One is a deposit from the air, which falls indifferently on trees, stones, grass, &c, and is generally thick and sticky, like honey, but under certain circumstances is "concreted into small granular masses." This bas been described by Aristotle (<span class= "ital">Hist. An., v. </span>22), Pliny (<span class= "ital">H. N., xi.</span> 12), Avicenna(p. 212), ?lian (<span class= "ital">Hist. An., xv.</span> 7), Shaw, Forskal, and others. It has been called <span class= "greekheb">????????</span> or "air-honey" (Athen. <span class= "ital">Deipn, xi.</span>, p. 500). It is collected by the Arabs, and eaten with their unleavened cakes as a condiment. It so far resembles the manna that it comes with the dew, is spread upon the ground generally, and melts when the sun's rays attain a certain power (?dmann: <span class= "ital">Misc. Collect., </span>vol. iv., p. 7). But it is never found in large quantities; it does not fall for more than two months in the year; and it is wholly unfit to serve as man's principal food, being more like honey than anything else. The other substance is a gum which exudes from certain trees at certain seasons of the year, in consequence of the punctures made in their leaves by a small insect, the <span class= "ital">Coccus manniparus. </span>It has been described at length by C. Niebuhr in his <span class= "ital">Description de l' Arabie </span>(pp. 128, 129); by Rauwolf (<span class= "ital">Travels, </span>vol. I., p. 94); Gmelin (<span class= "ital">Travels through Russia to Persia, </span>Part III., p. 28), and others. It is comparatively a dry substance, is readily shaken from the leaves, and consists of small yellowish ? white grains, which are hard, and have been compared to coriander seed by moderns (Rauwolf, <span class= "ital">50s.100</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The name "manna" attaches in the East to this latter substance, which is employed both as a condiment, like the "air-honey," and also as a laxative. The special points in which it differs from the manna of Scripture are its confinement to certain trees or bushes, its comparative permanency, for it "accumulates on the leaves" (Niebuhr, p. 129), and its unfitness for food. It has also, like the "air-honey," only a short season--the months of July and August.<p>The manna of Scripture in certain respects resembles the one, and in certain other respects the other of these substances, but in its most important characteristics resembles neither, and is altogether <span class= "ital">sui generis. </span>For (1) it was adapted to be men's principal nourishment, and served the Israelites as such for forty years; (2) it was supplied in quantities far exceeding anything that is recorded of the natural substances compared with it; (3) it continued through the whole of the year; (4) for forty years it fell regularly for six nights following, and ceased upon the seventh night; (5) it "bred worms" if kept to a second day, when gathered on five days out of the six, but when gathered on the sixth day continued good throughout the seventh, and bred no worms. The manna of Scripture must therefore be regarded as a miraculous substance, created <span class= "ital">ad hoc, </span>and not as a natural product. It pleased the Creator, however, to proceed <span class= "ital">on the lines </span>of Nature, so to speak, and to assimilate His new to certain of His old creations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the dew that lay was gone</span> <span class="cmt_word">up.</span> The moisture which lay upon the herbage soon evaporated, drawn up by the sun; and then the miracle revealed itself. There remained upon each leaf and each blade of grass a delicate small substance, compared here to <span class="cmt_word">hoar frost</span>, and elsewhere (<a href="/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>) to "coriander seed," which was easily detached and collected in bags or baskets. The thing was altogether a novelty to the Israelites, though analogous in some degree to natural processes still occurring in the country. These processes are of two kinds. At certain times of the year there is a deposit of a glutinous substance from the air upon leaves and even upon stones, which may be scraped off, and which resembles thick honey. There is also an exudation from various trees and shrubs, especially the tamarisk, which is moderately hard, and is found both on the growing plant and on the fallen leaves beneath it, in the shape of small, round, white or greyish grains. It is this last which is the manna of commerce. The Biblical manna cannot be identified with either of these two substances. In some points it resembled the one, in other points the other; in some, it differed from both. It came out of the air like the "air-honey," and did not exude from shrubs; but it was hard, like the manna of commerce, and could be "ground in mills" and "beaten in mortars," which the "air-honey" cannot. It was not a medicament, like the one, nor a condiment, like the other, but a substance suited to be a substitute for bread, and to become the main sustenance of the Israelitish people. It was produced in quantities far exceeding anything that is recorded of either manna proper, or air honey. It accompanied the Israelites wherever they went during the space of forty years, whereas the natural substances, which in certain points resemble it, are confined to certain districts, and to certain seasons of the year. During the whole space of forty years it fell regularly during six consecutive days, and then ceased on the seventh. It "bred worms" if kept till the morrow on all days of the week except one; on that one - the Sabbath - it bred no worms, but was sweet and good.
