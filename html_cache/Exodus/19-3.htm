This ascent is a recurring theme in Moses' life, symbolizing his unique role as a prophet and leader. The mountain, likely Mount Sinai, is a place of divine revelation, where God imparts His law and covenant. This act of going up to God highlights Moses' obedience and willingness to seek God's presence, a model for spiritual leadership.<p><b>and the LORD called to him from the mountain</b><br>The LORD calling to Moses emphasizes God's initiative in communication and revelation. It underscores the personal relationship between God and Moses, where God speaks directly to him. This divine call from the mountain signifies the holiness and authority of God's message. The mountain serves as a sacred space, set apart for divine encounters, reinforcing the idea of God's transcendence and immanence.<p><b>&#8220;This is what you are to tell the house of Jacob</b><br>The phrase "house of Jacob" refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel. It emphasizes the covenantal relationship established with the patriarchs, linking the present generation to the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This designation reminds the Israelites of their identity and heritage as God's chosen people, called to live according to His statutes.<p><b>and explain to the sons of Israel:</b><br>The term "sons of Israel" is synonymous with the Israelites, highlighting their collective identity as a nation. The instruction to "explain" indicates the importance of clear communication and understanding of God's commands. It underscores the role of Moses as a teacher and leader, responsible for conveying God's will to the people. This phrase also points to the necessity of passing down God's laws and teachings to future generations, ensuring the continuity of faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central human figure in this passage, Moses acts as the mediator between God and the Israelites.

AS Moses, having reached the foot of Sinai, was proceeding to ascend the mountain, where he looked to have special revelations from God, God called to him out of the mountain, and required a positive engagement on the part of the people, before he would condescend to enter into further direct relations with them. If, through gratitude for what had been done for them in the deliverance from Egypt, and since, they would solemnly engage to obey God and keep the covenant that he should make with them (verse 5), then a fresh revelation should be made, and fresh engagements entered into; but not otherwise. Moses communicated the message to the people through the alders, and received the solemn promise, which he carried back to God. "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses</span> <span class="cmt_word">went up unto God</span>. From the time of his call Moses had known that Israel was to serve God upon Sinai (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), and had regarded either one special peak, or the whole range as "the mount of God" - a place dedicated and set apart to Jehovah. It was natural, therefore, that, so soon as he reached the near vicinity of the mount, he should ascend it. The Lord <span class="cmt_word">called to him out of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Mount.</span> God often accepts the will for the deed, and spares his saints a needless toil. Here, as Moses was on his way, God anticipated him, and calling to him out of the mountain sent him back to the people with a message. <span class="cmt_word">The house of Jacob</span>.
