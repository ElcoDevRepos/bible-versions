Acacia trees were common in the Sinai region, making them a practical choice for construction. The number five often represents grace in biblical numerology, suggesting the grace of God in providing a means for His presence among His people. The posts served as a structural support for the curtain, which separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, emphasizing the holiness and separation of God from sin.<p><b>Overlay them with gold hooks</b><br>Gold in the tabernacle symbolizes divinity and purity, reflecting the divine nature of God. The overlaying of the posts with gold signifies the sanctity and glory of the tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt. The use of gold hooks indicates the importance of the curtain, as it was the barrier between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This separation highlights the need for mediation between God and humanity, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ as our High Priest.<p><b>And cast five bronze bases for them</b><br>Bronze, often associated with judgment and strength, was used for the bases, providing stability and support for the posts. The combination of gold and bronze in the tabernacle's construction reflects the balance of God's holiness and justice. The use of bronze bases also connects to the bronze altar, where sacrifices were made, pointing to the necessity of atonement for sin. The number five, repeated here, reinforces the theme of grace, as the bases uphold the posts that support the curtain, symbolizing the grace that upholds the law and the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/entrance_curtain.htm">Entrance Curtain</a></b><br>A specially designed curtain for the entrance of the Tabernacle, made with specific colors and materials.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/acacia_wood.htm">Acacia Wood</a></b><br>A durable wood used in the construction of the Tabernacle's posts, symbolizing strength and endurance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/embroiderer.htm">Embroiderer</a></b><br>The skilled artisan responsible for crafting the intricate designs on the curtain, highlighting the importance of beauty and craftsmanship in worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_colors.htm">Symbolism of Colors</a></b><br>The blue, purple, and scarlet yarns symbolize royalty, divinity, and sacrifice.

The materials and arrangement all point to Christ: incorruptible humanity, divine glory, the righteous barrier His sacrifice would ultimately remove, and the firm foundation of satisfied justice.

The two pillars nearest to the central one probably measured ten cubits, and stood in line with the two walls of the <span class="accented">mishkan</span>.
