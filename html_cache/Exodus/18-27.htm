This visit is significant as it highlights the importance of family ties and the sharing of wisdom. Jethro, a Midianite priest, had offered Moses valuable advice on leadership and governance, suggesting the delegation of responsibilities to capable men (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-23</a>). This advice was crucial for the effective management of the Israelite community. The phrase indicates a respectful and amicable parting, suggesting that Moses valued Jethro's counsel and presence. The act of sending Jethro on his way also reflects the cultural norms of hospitality and respect for elders in ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>and Jethro returned to his own land</b><br>Jethro's return to his own land, Midian, signifies the continuation of his life and duties as a priest and leader among his people. Midian was located in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, and its people were descendants of Abraham through his wife Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>). This connection to Abraham highlights the broader family ties among the peoples of the region. Jethro's departure also underscores the transient nature of his visit, which was primarily to offer support and guidance to Moses. The return to his land suggests a fulfillment of his role and responsibilities there, maintaining the balance between his duties to his family and his own community. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the diverse interactions and relationships between the Israelites and other groups in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Exodus, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

The time of Jethro's departure, and indeed of his entire visit, has been matter of controversy. Kurtz is of opinion that Jethro waited till the news of Israel's victory over Amalek reached him, before setting out from his own country. Hence he concludes, that "a whole month or more may easily have intervened between the victory over Amalek and the arrival of Jethro," whose arrival in that case "would not even fall into the very earliest period of the sojourn at Sinai, but after the promulgation of the first Sinaitic law." Those who identify Hobab with Jethro find in <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29-32</a> a proof that at any rate Jethro prolonged his visit until after the law was given, and did not "depart to his own land" before the removal of the people from the wilderness of Sinai to that of Paran, "in the 20th day of the second month of the second year" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, ver. 11). The position, however, of ch. 18, together with its contents - beth what it says and what it omits - are conclusive against this view. Jethro started on his journey when he heard "that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt" (ver. 1), not when he heard that Israel had been victorious over Amalek. His conversation with Moses (vers. 7-11) ranged over the entire series of deliverances from the night of the departure out of Egypt to the Amalekite defeat, but contained no allusion to the giving of the law. The occupation of Moses on the day after his arrival (ver. 13) is suitable to the quiet period which followed the Amalekite defeat, but not to the exciting time of the Sinaitic manifestations. It may be added that the practice of inculcating general principles on occasion of his particular judgments, of which Moses speaks (ver. 16), is suitable to the period anterior to the promulgation of the law, but not to that following it. The argument from <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29-32</a> fails altogether, so soon as it is seen that Jethro and Hobab are distinct persons, probably brothers, sons of Reuel (or Raguel), and brothers- in-law of Moses. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses let his father-in-law depart</span>. Literally, "dismissed him," "sent him away." This single expression is quite enough to prove that the Hobab, whom Moses made strenuous efforts to keep with him after Sinai was left, is not the Jethro whom he was quite content to let go<span class="cmt_word">. He went his way into his own land</span>. He returned to Midian, probably crossing the Elanitic gulf, which divided Midian from the Sinaitic region. The exact time of the departure is uncertain; but it was probably before the main events related in ch. 19. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/18-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#353;al&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his father-in-law {on his way},</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2859.htm">Strong's 2859: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, away in marriage, to contract affinity by marriage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and [Jethro] returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his own land.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/18-27.htm">OT Law: Exodus 18:27 Moses let his father-in-law depart and he (Exo.
