The "there" refers to the Tabernacle, a central place of worship and divine encounter. The Tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their desert wanderings, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This meeting signifies God's desire for intimacy and guidance, echoing His covenant promises. It parallels the New Testament concept of God dwelling among His people through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>and that place will be consecrated by My glory</b><br>The consecration of the Tabernacle by God's glory indicates a divine setting apart for holy purposes. "Glory" here refers to the visible manifestation of God's presence, often depicted as a cloud or fire (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). This consecration underscores the holiness required for worship and the seriousness of approaching God. It foreshadows the ultimate consecration through Christ, whose sacrifice sanctifies believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The concept of God's glory filling a place is also seen in the dedication of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>), reinforcing the continuity of God's presence with His people throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is speaking about His intention to meet with the Israelites.

The chapter terminates with a parenthetic insertion of various promises, intended to cheer the Israelites under the hard circumstances of their wanderings in the wilderness, and growing out of the mention of the tabernacle as "the tabernacle of meeting" (ver. 42). "There," says God, "He will meet, not only Moses, to speak to him, but also the children of Israel, to receive their offerings, hear their prayers, and grant their requests. There will he meet them, and there his glory shall be; and the tabernacle shall be thereby sanctified. He will sanctify both the tabernacle and the altar; he will sanctify, moreover, both Aaron and his sons; and he will dwell among the children of Israel, and be their God; and they shall know him." Very precious and gracious promises, made absolutely; though, as the result showed (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-18</a>), contingent on their obedience; and faithfully performed, as long as even a remnant was obedient, during a space of above seven hundred years from the Exodus to the Captivity! <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There will I meet the children of Israel</span>. Lay Israelites might not enter the tabernacle, and could only "meet God" at its entrance, when they brought their sacrifices to the altar. He promises, however, to meet them on these occasions with favour and. acceptance<span class="cmt_word">. The tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory</span>. Compare <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>. The presence of the Shechinah was the true sanctification of the tabernacle - all the rest was mere type and figure. God not only "put his name there," but put his presence there visibly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/29-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will also meet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#8216;a&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3259.htm">Strong's 3259: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fix upon, to meet, to summon, to direct, to engage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and that place will be consecrated</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;niq&#183;da&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6942.htm">Strong's 6942: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be set apart or consecrated</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by My glory.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7733;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3519.htm">Strong's 3519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Weight, splendor, copiousness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/29-43.htm">OT Law: Exodus 29:43 There I will meet with the children (Exo.
