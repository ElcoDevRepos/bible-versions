The act of bringing the people out of the camp signifies a transition from their ordinary lives to a sacred encounter with God. This movement from the camp to the mountain is symbolic of leaving behind the mundane to enter into a divine presence, similar to how believers are called to separate themselves from worldly concerns to focus on God (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>to meet with God</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose of the gathering: a direct encounter with the divine. The Israelites are about to experience a theophany, a visible manifestation of God, which is a rare and significant event in biblical history. This meeting is a fulfillment of God's promise to Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and establishes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It prefigures the ultimate meeting with God through Christ, who reconciles humanity to God (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>and they stood at the foot of the mountain</b><br>The mountain, identified as Mount Sinai, is a place of divine revelation and covenant. Geographically, Mount Sinai is traditionally located in the Sinai Peninsula, though its exact location is debated. Standing at the foot of the mountain signifies the people's readiness to receive God's law, which will be given in the form of the Ten Commandments. This position also underscores the holiness of God, as the people are not permitted to ascend the mountain, reflecting the separation between a holy God and sinful humanity. This separation is ultimately bridged by Christ, who provides access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage and to guide them through the wilderness.
