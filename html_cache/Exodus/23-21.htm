In the context of Exodus, this refers to the Angel of the Lord, who is often seen as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. The call to "pay attention" and "listen" echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which commands Israel to hear and obey the Lord. This highlights the necessity of heeding divine guidance, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-21</a>, where wisdom is gained through attentive listening.<p><b>do not defy him,</b><br>Defiance against the messenger is equated with defiance against God Himself. This reflects the seriousness of rebellion against divine authority, as seen in the rebellion of Korah in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. The cultural context of the ancient Near East often involved strict adherence to the words of a king's envoy, and here, the Angel is portrayed with similar authority. This command underscores the gravity of disobedience and the consequences that follow, as seen in the Israelites' wilderness wanderings due to their rebellion.<p><b>for he will not forgive rebellion,</b><br>The inability to forgive rebellion indicates the severity of sin against God's appointed messenger. In the Old Testament, rebellion against God often led to dire consequences, such as the Babylonian exile. This phrase underscores the holiness and justice of God, who cannot overlook sin. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that rejection of Christ, the ultimate messenger, results in judgment (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a>).<p><b>since My Name is in him.</b><br>The phrase "My Name is in him" signifies the divine authority and presence within the Angel. In biblical terms, a name represents character and essence. This is a profound statement of the Angel's identity, suggesting a unique unity with God. It prefigures the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who bears the name above all names (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) and embodies the fullness of God (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). This connection highlights the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>This passage refers to a divine messenger, often understood as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ or a special angelic presence representing God Himself.

This teaches us to hold God's name in high regard and live in a way that honors Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_rebellion.htm">Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>The warning against defying the Angel serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and rebellion against God.
