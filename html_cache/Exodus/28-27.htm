Gold, a precious metal, is often associated with royalty and divine nature, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple. The use of gold in the priestly garments signifies the sacredness of the priestly office and the glory of God.<p><b>and attach them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod</b><br>The ephod is a significant garment worn by the high priest, representing his role as a mediator between God and the people. The shoulder pieces of the ephod bear the names of the tribes of Israel, symbolizing the high priest carrying the people before God. The placement of the rings at the bottom of the shoulder pieces suggests a connection between the priest's service and the support of the entire community of Israel.<p><b>on its front, near its seam</b><br>The specific placement of the rings on the front of the ephod, near its seam, indicates precision and intentionality in the design of the priestly garments. This attention to detail reflects the order and structure inherent in God's instructions for worship and service. The seam may symbolize the joining together of different elements, much like the unity required among the tribes of Israel and the unity between God and His people.<p><b>just above its woven waistband</b><br>The woven waistband of the ephod serves both a functional and symbolic purpose. It secures the ephod to the high priest, ensuring that it remains in place during his duties. Symbolically, the waistband represents readiness and preparedness for service, akin to the biblical exhortation to gird oneself for action. The positioning of the rings just above the waistband highlights the interconnectedness of the priest's role, the garments, and the spiritual readiness required to serve God faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who was appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
