The use of poles and rings is consistent with the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/27-6.htm">Exodus 27:6-7</a>, highlighting the importance of mobility for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The altar's portability symbolizes the presence of God moving with His people, a theme that resonates throughout the Exodus narrative. The use of acacia wood for the poles, as specified earlier in Exodus, reflects the durability and availability of materials in the Sinai region. This design also prefigures the concept of God dwelling among His people, which is fully realized in the New Testament with the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>He made the altar with boards so that it was hollow.</b><br>The construction of the altar with boards, making it hollow, indicates a practical approach to its design, ensuring it was lightweight and easier to transport. This hollow structure would have allowed for efficient use of materials and facilitated the altar's function during sacrifices. The altar's design reflects the broader theme of God's provision and guidance, as He equips His people with what they need for worship. The hollow nature of the altar can also be seen as a metaphor for the human heart, which is meant to be filled with the presence of God. In a typological sense, the altar points to Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity, fulfilling the sacrificial system's requirements once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">The Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A central piece of the Tabernacle where sacrifices were made, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Law and instructions for worship through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of 40 years when the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, during which the Tabernacle was constructed and used.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The construction of the altar according to God's specific instructions highlights the importance of obedience in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The altar represents the need for atonement and points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mobility_and_presence.htm">Mobility and Presence</a></b><br>The design of the altar with poles for carrying signifies God's presence with His people wherever they go.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_reverence.htm">Holiness and Reverence</a></b><br>The altar's construction and use remind us of the holiness required in approaching God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_worship.htm">Community and Worship</a></b><br>The communal aspect of the altar's use underscores the importance of corporate worship and unity among believers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_38_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 38:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_38_7_Obedience_in_construction.htm">How does Exodus 38:7 demonstrate obedience to God's specific instructions for construction?

Together they foreshadow Christ, fully man yet able to endure divine judgment for sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>- Building with boards also made repairs feasible during forty years in the wilderness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that it was hollow</b><p>- A hollow interior reduced weight, easing transport. God never burdens His servants beyond what He supplies strength to bear (<a href="/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>).<p>- According to rabbinic tradition, priests could fill the hollow space with earth when the camp paused, complying with God&#8217;s earlier directive for &#8220;an altar of earth&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>).<p>- The cavity may also hint at the once-for-all fire of God that later fell on Elijah&#8217;s altar (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) and, ultimately, on Christ at Calvary, consuming the sacrifice so the sinner could go free.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/38-7.htm">Exodus 38:7</a> records careful, literal fulfillment of God&#8217;s blueprint: poles slid into rings on each side of a hollow, board-framed, bronze-covered altar so it could travel with Israel. The verse teaches that worship must follow God&#8217;s revealed order, rests on His gracious provision, and moves wherever His people go&#8212;truths fully realized in Jesus Christ, the final and mobile meeting place between God and humanity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/38-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he inserted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
