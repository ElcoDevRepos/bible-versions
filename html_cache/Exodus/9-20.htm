These individuals were part of the ruling class in Egypt, responsible for various administrative and governmental duties. Historically, Egypt was a powerful and advanced civilization, and its officials would have been well-educated and influential. The mention of Pharaoh's officials highlights the reach of God's influence, even among those who were not part of the Israelite community.<p><b>who feared the word of the LORD</b><br>The fear of the LORD here indicates a recognition of God's power and authority. This fear is not merely terror but a reverential awe and respect for God's commands and warnings. In the context of the plagues, it shows that some Egyptians acknowledged the reality and power of the God of Israel. This fear is similar to the fear of the LORD described in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which is the beginning of knowledge. It also foreshadows the eventual acknowledgment of God's power by the Egyptians during the Exodus.<p><b>hurried to bring their servants and livestock to shelter</b><br>This action demonstrates a practical response to the warning given by God through Moses. The officials' decision to protect their servants and livestock shows a belief in the impending judgment and a desire to preserve life and property. It reflects a contrast between those who heed God's warnings and those who do not, as seen in the broader narrative of the plagues. This act of taking shelter can be seen as a type of seeking refuge in God, akin to the protection offered by the blood of the Passover lamb, which is a type of Christ's sacrificial protection for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_officials.htm">Pharaoh's Officials</a></b><br>These are the Egyptian officials serving under Pharaoh.

It is a new fact that any of the Egyptians had been brought to "fear the word of Jehovah." Probably, the effect of the plagues had been gradually to convince a considerable number, not so much that Jehovah was the one True God as that he was a great and powerful god, whose chastisements were to be feared. Consequently there were now a certain number among the "servants of Pharaoh" who pro-fired by the warning given (ver. 19), and housed their cattle and herdsmen, in anticipation of the coming storm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/9-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Those among Pharaoh&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">officials</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;&#7695;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
