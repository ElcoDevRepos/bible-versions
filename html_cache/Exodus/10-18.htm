This phrase indicates a moment of transition where Moses departs from the royal court. The context here is the ongoing negotiation between Moses and Pharaoh regarding the release of the Israelites from slavery. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine figures in Egyptian culture, making Moses' boldness in confronting him significant. This departure signifies a moment of intercession, where Moses steps away from human authority to seek divine intervention.<p><b>and appealed to the LORD.</b><br>Moses' appeal to the LORD demonstrates his role as an intercessor for the people of Israel. This act of prayer highlights the relationship between Moses and God, where Moses consistently seeks God's guidance and intervention. Theologically, this reflects the biblical principle of reliance on God rather than human power. It also prefigures the mediatory role of Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity. The act of appealing to the LORD underscores the importance of prayer and dependence on God in times of crisis, a theme echoed throughout scripture, such as in the Psalms and the New Testament teachings on prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central human figure in this passage, Moses is the prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
