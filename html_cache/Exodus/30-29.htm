In the context of <a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30</a>, this refers to the anointing of the tabernacle and its furnishings, signifying their dedication to God. The Hebrew word for consecrate, "qadash," implies making something holy or sanctified. This process is a physical representation of spiritual purity and dedication. The consecration of objects in the tabernacle foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>so that they will be most holy</b><br>The term "most holy" indicates a level of sanctity that is above ordinary holiness. In the tabernacle, certain items were designated as "most holy," signifying their exclusive use in worship and service to God. This reflects the holiness of God Himself, who is utterly set apart from sin and impurity. The concept of "most holy" is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>). The holiness of these objects also points to the ultimate holiness of Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets.<p><b>Whatever touches them shall be holy</b><br>This phrase underscores the transformative power of holiness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the idea that holiness could be transferred through contact was significant. It highlights the seriousness of approaching God and His sacred objects with reverence. This principle is seen in the New Testament when Jesus touches the unclean and they become clean (<a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-42</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the call to purity and the transformative power of God's presence in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions from God on Mount Sinai regarding the construction and consecration of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, which included various holy items and altars that were to be consecrated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration.htm">Consecration</a></b><br>The act of making something sacred or holy, set apart for God's purposes.

Just as Isaiah&#8217;s lips were purified by a coal from the altar (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6&#8211;7</a>), so our lives are transformed by contact with the Lord through His Word and Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> commands Moses to set apart the tabernacle furnishings and priests with sacred oil, marking them as God&#8217;s exclusive possession. This consecration makes them &#8220;most holy,&#8221; reserved for divine service alone. Anything that touches these sanctified items becomes holy in turn, illustrating how God&#8217;s holiness both protects and transforms. The passage calls us to recognize the absolute authority of God&#8217;s Word, respect what He declares holy, and draw near so that His holiness can shape our lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/30-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to consecrate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qid&#183;da&#353;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
