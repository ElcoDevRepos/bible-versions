This phrase highlights their physical need for water, a basic necessity for survival. The wilderness journey was a test of faith, as God had previously provided for them through miraculous means, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the provision of manna. The lack of water serves as a recurring theme in the Israelites' journey, symbolizing spiritual thirst and dependence on God. This situation foreshadows Jesus' declaration as the "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>, offering spiritual sustenance.<p><b>and they grumbled against Moses</b><br>Grumbling against Moses reflects the Israelites' lack of faith and trust in God's provision. Moses, as God's appointed leader, often bore the brunt of the people's complaints. This behavior is a pattern seen throughout the Exodus narrative, where the Israelites frequently express dissatisfaction despite witnessing God's power and deliverance. The grumbling signifies a deeper spiritual issue of unbelief and rebellion, which is addressed in <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-11</a>, warning against hardening one's heart.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you brought us out of Egypt&#8212;</b><br>This question reveals the Israelites' short-sightedness and nostalgia for their past, despite the harsh conditions of slavery in Egypt. It underscores a common human tendency to romanticize the past when faced with present difficulties. The Exodus from Egypt is a central theme in the Bible, symbolizing salvation and deliverance. The Israelites' questioning of their liberation reflects a struggle to embrace their new identity as God's chosen people, a theme echoed in the New Testament as believers are called to leave behind their old lives (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?&#8221;</b><br>The mention of children and livestock emphasizes the severity of the situation, as the lack of water threatened the entire community's survival. This phrase highlights the Israelites' fear and desperation, which often led them to doubt God's intentions and care. The concern for future generations and their well-being is a recurring biblical theme, pointing to the importance of faith and obedience for the sake of posterity. The Israelites' fear contrasts with God's faithfulness, as He ultimately provides water from the rock, prefiguring Christ as the spiritual rock who sustains His people (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader appointed by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and guide them to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rephidim.htm">Rephidim</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites camped and experienced a lack of water, leading to their grumbling.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>Represents the period of testing and reliance on God for the Israelites as they journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grumbling.htm">Grumbling</a></b><br>The act of complaining against Moses, which reflects a deeper issue of distrust in God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The Israelites' grumbling reveals a lack of trust in God's ability to provide.

The verse warns against allowing present difficulty to rewrite the past and malign the God who saves. Remembering His prior provisions, resisting the pull of complaint, and believing He intends good for every member of His covenant family remain timeless lessons for all who journey with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">To kill us.</span>--This was no exaggeration.

Unless a supply could somehow or other have been provided speedily, the whole people must have been exterminated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people thirsted there for water.</span> There is probably no physical affliction comparable to intense thirst. His thirst was the only agony which drew from the Son of Man an acknowledgment of physical suffering, in the words "I thirst."

Thirst in the desert can scarcely be less horrible. <span class="cmt_word">The people murmured and said</span> When the worst comes on men, if they are alone, they bear it silently; but if they can find a scapegoat, they murmur.
