In the context of the plagues in Egypt, it underscores the contrast between those who heeded God's warnings and those who did not. The "word of the LORD" refers to the divine message delivered through Moses, which was a call to action to protect themselves from the impending plague. This reflects a broader biblical theme where ignoring God's word leads to consequences, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with Adam and Eve's disobedience. It also foreshadows the importance of faith and obedience in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes hearing and acting upon His words (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><b>left their servants and livestock in the field</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the tangible consequences of ignoring divine warnings. In ancient Egypt, livestock were vital to the economy and daily life, serving as a source of food, labor, and wealth. By leaving their servants and livestock in the field, those who disregarded God's warning exposed them to the deadly hailstorm, resulting in significant loss. This act of negligence can be seen as a lack of stewardship and care for what God has entrusted to them. It also serves as a parallel to spiritual neglect, where failing to heed God's word can lead to spiritual ruin. The imagery of leaving the field unprotected can be connected to Jesus' parable of the sower, where the seed that falls on rocky ground or among thorns fails to thrive (<a href="/mark/4-3.htm">Mark 4:3-20</a>), symbolizing the importance of a receptive heart to God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God's commands delivered through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God demonstrated His power through the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments sent by God upon Egypt, with the seventh being the plague of hail.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were living in Egypt and were the intended recipients of God's deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_heeding_god's_word.htm">The Importance of Heeding God's Word</a></b><br>Ignoring God's warnings leads to destruction.

Up in <a href="/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>, some Egyptians &#8220;feared the word of the LORD&#8221; and hustled their slaves and animals indoors. Now, &#8220;but those&#8221; points to the opposite group&#8212;a reminder that two very different responses always arise when God speaks (see <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24&#8211;27</a> where hearers either build on rock or sand).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warnings divide people: some heed, some don&#8217;t. The narrative invites us to locate ourselves: are we among the &#8220;some&#8221; or the &#8220;those&#8221;?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who disregarded the word of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Disregarded&#8221; shows deliberate neglect, not innocent ignorance. Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians had already confessed, &#8220;This is the finger of God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>), so the people knew whose word was at stake.<p>&#8226; Ignoring God&#8217;s word is never neutral; it is active rebellion (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7&#8211;12</a> warns that unbelief hardens the heart).<p>&#8226; The Lord gave clear, gracious advance notice of the coming hail (<a href="/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18&#8211;19</a>). Disregard after such clarity heightens accountability (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>left their servants and livestock</b><p>&#8226; What we treasure reveals our heart. By leaving both people and property exposed, these Egyptians valued convenience or skepticism over life itself.<p>&#8226; Earlier plagues hit frogs, gnats, and flies&#8212;now God targets what Egypt prizes economically (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, the livestock plague, and again here). The choice to ignore God endangers everything under one&#8217;s care (<a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast the centurion in <a href="/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1&#8211;10</a> who used authority to protect his servant; here, authority is misused through apathy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the field</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;field&#8221; becomes the place of judgment. Hail mixed with fire would soon strike there (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty extends outdoors and indoors. Safety is not about location but obedience (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail emphasizes immediacy: they left them right where they were, implying no intention to change course. Persistent disobedience tends to lock us in place (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21</a> exposes a heart posture, not just an ancient decision. When God graciously warns, some respond in reverent action, others shrug and leave life vulnerable. Disregarding the Lord&#8217;s word is active defiance that endangers people, possessions, and ultimately souls. The verse urges every reader to move from careless exposure in &#8220;the field&#8221; to humble shelter under God&#8217;s spoken truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that regarded not</span>. If there were men who believed in the power and truthfulness of Jehovah, there were probably more who did not believe. As Lot "seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law" (<a href="/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>), so Moses and Aaron appeared to the great mass of the Egyptians. As observed above, a hail-storm that could endanger life, either of man or beast, was beyond all Egyptian experience, and must have seemed almost impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/9-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but those who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">disregarded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1435;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;z&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5800.htm">Strong's 5800: </a> </span><span class="str2">To loosen, relinquish, permit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1445;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and livestock</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;n&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4735.htm">Strong's 4735: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something bought, property, livestock, acquisition</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the field.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7695;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7704.htm">Strong's 7704: </a> </span><span class="str2">Field, land</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/9-21.htm">OT Law: Exodus 9:21 Whoever didn't regard the word of Yahweh (Exo.
