The Canaanites were the inhabitants of this land, which included various tribes such as the Hittites, Amorites, and Jebusites. The land of Canaan is geographically located in the region that is now modern-day Israel and Palestine. This promise is rooted in the covenant God made with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>, where God promised to give his descendants this land. The deliverance into Canaan is a significant event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the beginning of a new chapter for the Israelites.<p><b>and gives it to you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine initiative and sovereignty in the Israelites' acquisition of the land. It is not by their own strength or merit that they receive the land, but as a gift from God. This reflects the biblical theme of grace, where God provides for His people out of His own goodness. The giving of the land is also a type of the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, where believers are said to have obtained an inheritance in Him.<p><b>as He swore to you and your fathers</b><br>This phrase highlights the covenantal nature of God's promise. The reference to "your fathers" points back to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;to whom God originally made the promise. This underscores the continuity of God's plan and His faithfulness across generations. The swearing of an oath by God is a solemn commitment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-18</a>, where God swears by Himself to bless Abraham and his descendants. This assurance of God's unchanging promise is a cornerstone of Israel's faith and is echoed in the New Testament, where God's promises are fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to bring His people into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are being led out of Egypt and into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanites.htm">The Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that God promised to give to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God swore to give to the forefathers of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The promise made by God to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) regarding the land and their descendants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.
