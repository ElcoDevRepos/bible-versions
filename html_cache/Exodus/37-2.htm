Gold, a precious and incorruptible metal, symbolizes purity and the glory of God. In the ancient Near East, gold was often associated with royalty and deity, underscoring the Ark's role as the earthly throne of God. This overlaying with gold also prefigures the divine nature of Jesus Christ, who is described as pure and without blemish.<p><b>both inside and out</b><br>Covering the Ark both inside and out with gold emphasizes the completeness and perfection required in the worship of God. This dual covering can be seen as a reflection of the inner and outer purity expected of believers, aligning with the biblical theme that God looks at the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also points to the comprehensive nature of Christ's righteousness, which covers believers entirely.<p><b>and made a gold molding around it</b><br>The gold molding around the Ark served both a decorative and functional purpose, preventing the cover from slipping. This molding can be seen as a type of the crown of thorns placed on Jesus' head, symbolizing His kingship and the suffering He endured. The molding also signifies the boundary between the holy and the profane, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, reminding believers of the separation between God's holiness and human sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the Ark of the Covenant.
