This act of returning to the LORD signifies a pattern of seeking divine guidance and intervention, a common theme throughout the Bible. It reflects the intimate relationship Moses had with God, where he could openly express his concerns and frustrations. This mirrors the practice of lament found in the Psalms, where believers bring their grievances before God.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people?</b><br>Moses questions God&#8217;s intentions, reflecting a moment of doubt and confusion. This echoes the human tendency to question divine plans when faced with adversity. The phrase "brought trouble" can be connected to the Hebrew word "ra'ah," which often denotes calamity or evil. This highlights the tension between God's promises and the current suffering of the Israelites. It also parallels the cries of the Israelites in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>, where they groan under slavery, prompting God to act.<p><b>Is this why You sent me?</b><br>Moses questions his mission and purpose, a common theme in the lives of biblical figures who face trials. This reflects the testing of faith and the struggle to understand God's timing and methods. Moses' doubt can be compared to the struggles of other prophets, such as Jeremiah, who also questioned their calling (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-9</a>). This phrase foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus Christ, who also faced moments of anguish and questioning in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), yet remained obedient to His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Moses, faithful yet frustrated, turns to the Lord with raw questions. The verse teaches that believers may experience intensified trials immediately after stepping out in faith. God invites candid dialogue, uses temporary hardship to advance His redemptive plan, and remains sovereign over every setback.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Moses returned unto the Lord.</span>--He could find nothing to say to the officers. The course of events had as much disappointed him as it had them All that he could do was to complain to God, with a freedom which seems to us almost to border on irreverence, but which God excused in him, since it had its root in his tender love for his people. Moses might perhaps have borne with patience a mere negative result--the postponement of any open manifestation of the Divine power--but the thought that he had increased the burthens and aggravated the misery of his countrymen was more than he could bear without complaining<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - The two brothers made no reply to the words of the officers. Perhaps their hearts were too full for speech; perhaps they knew not what to say. Whatever faith they had, it did no doubt seem a hard thing that their interference, Divinely ordered as it was, should have produced as yet nothing but an aggravation of their misery to the Israelite people. They could not understand the course of the Divine action. God had warned them not to expect success at once (<a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>); but he had said nothing of evil consequences following upon their first efforts. Thus we can well understand that the two brothers (and especially Moses, the more impetuous of them) were bitterly grieved and disappointed. They felt their cup of sorrow to be full - the reproaches of the officers made it overflow. Hence the bitterness of the complaint with which this chapter terminates, and which introduces the long series of precious promise, contained in the opening section of ch. 6. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses returned unto the Lord</span>. We are not to understand that Moses had forsaken God and now "returned" to him but simply that in his trouble he had recourse to God, took his sorrow to the Throne of Grace, and poured it out before the Almighty A good example truly, and one which Christians in all their trials would do well to follow. <span class="cmt_word">Lord, wherefore</span>, etc. The words, no doubt, are bold. They have been said to "approach to irreverence." But there are parallels to them, which have never been regarded as irreverent, in the Psalms: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why does thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?" (<a href="/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>) "How long wilt thou hide thyself? Where are thy former lovingkindnesses? Wherefore hast thou made all men for nought?" (<a href="/psalms/89-46.htm">Psalm 89:46</a>-9), and the like. Kalisch seems right in saying that "the desponding complaint of Moses was not the result of disbelief or doubt, but the effort of a pious soul struggling after a deeper penetration into the mysteries of the Almighty." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/5-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
