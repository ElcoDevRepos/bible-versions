In the context of <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, the Israelites had committed idolatry by worshiping the golden calf. Moses interceded on behalf of the people, pleading with God to spare them. The term "relented" does not imply a change in God's nature or character, as God is immutable (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). Instead, it reflects God's responsiveness to human repentance and intercession. This is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God responds to prayer and repentance, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a> when Nineveh repented and God withheld judgment.<p><b>from the calamity</b><br>The "calamity" refers to the severe judgment God had planned to execute on the Israelites for their sin of idolatry. This judgment was averted due to Moses' intercession. The concept of divine judgment is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing God's holiness and justice. However, God's willingness to relent from bringing calamity also highlights His mercy and grace, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where His mercies are described as new every morning.<p><b>He had threatened</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of God's warning to the Israelites. The threat of judgment serves as a deterrent to sin and a call to repentance. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience or disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The threat was not an empty one, as God is just and righteous, but it also shows that God communicates His intentions clearly, giving people the opportunity to repent.<p><b>to bring on His people</b><br>"His people" refers to the Israelites, whom God had chosen as His covenant people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Despite their rebellion, God remained committed to His covenant promises. This relationship is foundational to understanding the narrative of the Old Testament and God's redemptive plan. The phrase also points to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His people, even when they are unfaithful, as seen in the prophetic books like Hosea, where God&#8217;s enduring love for Israel is depicted despite their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.

He is personal, present, and deeply involved with His people. His very name carries the idea of self-existence and faithfulness, so whatever follows flows out of a God who &#8220;does not change&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). This verse reminds us that the coming action is not capricious; it is the deliberate choice of the sovereign LORD who remains completely consistent with His perfect character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Relented</b><p>&#8220;Relented&#8221; describes a real, purposeful shift in God&#8217;s announced course&#8212;nothing fickle, but a genuine turning from judgment to mercy. Scripture regularly shows the LORD doing this when intercession is offered or repentance is demonstrated:<p>&#8226; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>&#8212;God &#8220;relented from the disaster He had threatened.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>&#8212;if a nation turns, God &#8220;will relent.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/106-45.htm">Psalm 106:45</a>&#8212;He &#8220;remembered His covenant &#8230; and relented.&#8221;<p>In <a href="/bsb/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, Moses intercedes (verses 11-13), appealing to God&#8217;s promises. God&#8217;s relenting reveals His consistent character: justice that is ready to show mercy when a mediator steps in. He is not changing in essence; He is expressing a different facet of His unchanging righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the calamity</b><p>The &#8220;calamity&#8221; was no idle threat. After the golden calf, God said, &#8220;My anger may burn against them and consume them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). Sin always invites real consequences (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>). The magnitude of the threatened judgment underscores both Israel&#8217;s guilt (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>) and the depth of God&#8217;s mercy when He withholds it. His holiness demands punishment, yet His compassion makes room for pardon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He had threatened</b><p>God&#8217;s warning was clear and deserved. Warnings reveal His justice and reinforce that He never overlooks sin (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>). By stating the penalty up front, He shows that any reprieve is pure grace. Mercy, therefore, &#8220;triumphs over judgment&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>) without ever negating judgment&#8217;s legitimacy. The threatened disaster also highlights the effectiveness of Moses&#8217; priest-like intercession&#8212;pointing ahead to the perfect mediation of Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To bring on His people</b><p>&#8220;These people&#8221; were still &#8220;His people.&#8221; Their chosen status (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-11</a>) did not grant immunity from discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), but it did guarantee God&#8217;s continuing engagement. He remains committed even when they fail, preserving them so His redemptive plans can unfold. Peter later echoes this tension: a &#8220;chosen people&#8221; who must live obediently (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a> captures the heart of God&#8217;s covenant dealings: the LORD, unwavering in holiness, lovingly responds to intercession by withholding deserved judgment. His relenting is not a change in character but an expression of mercy consistent with His eternal nature. Sin is serious, warnings are real, yet grace prevails for those who stand under God&#8217;s chosen Mediator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord repented of the evil</span>. Changes of purpose are, of course, attributed to God by an "economy," or accommodation of the truth to human modes of speech and conception. "God is not a man that he should repent." He "knows the end from the beginning." When he threatened to destroy Israel, he knew that he would spare; but, as he communicated to Moses, first, his anger, and then, at a later period, his intention to spare, he is said to have "repented." The expression is an anthropomorphic one, like so many others, on which we have already commented.
