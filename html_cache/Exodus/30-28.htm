Located in the outer court of the Tabernacle, it was the place where sacrifices were made to atone for the sins of the people. This altar was made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, signifying its durability and the importance of the sacrifices made upon it. The burnt offering itself was a symbol of complete surrender to God, as the entire animal was consumed by fire. This altar foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself completely for the atonement of humanity's sins. The concept of sacrifice is deeply rooted in the biblical narrative, with the altar serving as a precursor to the cross.<p><b>and all its utensils</b><br>The utensils associated with the altar of burnt offering included items such as firepans, shovels, basins, forks, and firepans, all made of bronze. These tools were essential for the handling and management of the sacrifices, ensuring that the offerings were made according to God's specific instructions. The meticulous care in crafting these utensils reflects the holiness and orderliness required in worship. Each tool had a specific purpose, emphasizing the detailed nature of God's commands and the importance of obedience in worship practices. The use of bronze, a strong and durable metal, underscores the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>and the basin with its stand</b><br>The basin, also known as the laver, was used by the priests for ceremonial washing before they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar. This act of washing symbolized purification and the need for holiness when approaching God. The basin was made of bronze, crafted from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, highlighting the community's contribution to the Tabernacle's construction. The stand provided stability, ensuring that the basin was accessible and functional. This ritual cleansing prefigures the spiritual cleansing available through Jesus Christ, who washes believers from their sins, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a> and <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>. The emphasis on purity and preparation for worship is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, pointing to the necessity of approaching God with a clean heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the tabernacle and its furnishings from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">The Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A key component of the tabernacle, used for sacrifices and offerings to God, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basin_with_its_stand.htm">The Basin with its Stand</a></b><br>Used for ceremonial washing by the priests, symbolizing purification and readiness to serve.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites, representing God's desire to dwell with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Law and instructions for worship and community life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice_and_worship.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice and Worship</a></b><br>The altar of burnt offering represents the necessity of sacrifice in worship.
