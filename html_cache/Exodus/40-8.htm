It was a place where the Israelites could gather and offer sacrifices, symbolizing a transition from the secular to the holy. The courtyard measured 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide, as described in <a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9-19</a>. This space was enclosed by linen curtains, which were supported by bronze pillars. The use of bronze, a durable metal, signifies strength and endurance, reflecting the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. The courtyard's design emphasized the holiness of the Tabernacle, reminding the Israelites of the need for purity and reverence when approaching God.<p><b>and hang the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard.</b><br>The entrance curtain, also known as the screen, was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/27-16.htm">Exodus 27:16</a>. This curtain served as the sole entry point into the courtyard, symbolizing the exclusivity and sanctity of access to God's presence. The colors used in the curtain were significant, with blue representing divinity, purple symbolizing royalty, and scarlet indicating sacrifice. These colors foreshadowed the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the divine King and ultimate sacrifice. The curtain's function as a barrier also pointed to the separation between God and humanity due to sin, a separation that would later be bridged by Christ's atoning work. The act of hanging the curtain was a final step in preparing the Tabernacle for worship, underscoring the importance of order and obedience in the worship of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive the Law.
