This phrase highlights Moses' dependence on God, a recurring theme throughout the Exodus narrative. The act of crying out signifies a deep, urgent plea for help, reflecting Moses' role as an intercessor for the people. This is consistent with other instances where leaders in the Bible seek God's intervention, such as David in the Psalms.<p><b>&#8220;What should I do with these people?</b><br>This question underscores the tension between Moses and the Israelites. The phrase "these people" indicates a sense of frustration and distance, as Moses grapples with their repeated complaints and lack of faith. Historically, the Israelites' journey through the wilderness was marked by frequent grumbling, as seen in previous chapters. This reflects the broader theme of human disobedience and the challenge of leadership in guiding a rebellious people.<p><b>A little more and they will stone me!&#8221;</b><br>Stoning was a common form of execution in ancient Israel, reserved for serious offenses. Moses' fear of being stoned indicates the severity of the people's anger and their potential for violence. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the time, where leaders could face dire consequences if they failed to meet the expectations of the people. The threat of stoning also foreshadows the rejection and suffering of future leaders, including Jesus Christ, who faced hostility from those He came to save.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

Consistency in seeking God marks faithful leadership.<p>&#8226; Crying out underscores dependence. God had promised His presence (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), so Moses confidently brings the crisis to Him.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly encourages this reflex of prayer: &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>), echoed later by Jehoshaphat&#8217;s plea, &#8220;We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that spiritual leaders are not self-sufficient; even the meekest man on earth (<a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a>) needs divine help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What should I do with these people?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Moses&#8217; question is practical and pastoral. He is God&#8217;s appointed shepherd, yet even shepherds reach the end of their own ideas.<p>&#8226; This is not unbelief but humility&#8212;similar to the apostles&#8217; plea, &#8220;Increase our faith!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-5.htm">Luke 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording reflects strain: &#8220;these people&#8221; rather than &#8220;Your people&#8221; or &#8220;my people,&#8221; showing distance caused by continual grumbling (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-11.htm">Numbers 11:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God often lets circumstances expose our limitations so we lean harder on Him.
