Shepherding was a common occupation in the ancient Near East, often associated with leadership and care, foreshadowing Moses' role as the shepherd of Israel. Jethro, also known as Reuel, is a priest of Midian, indicating a connection to the broader Semitic world and suggesting a monotheistic belief system that aligns with the worship of Yahweh. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, linking Moses to the Abrahamic covenant.<p><b>He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness, or desert, is a place of testing and revelation in biblical narratives. Moses' journey to the far side of the wilderness symbolizes a transition from his past life in Egypt to his future mission. This setting is significant for divine encounters, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Elijah and Jesus. The wilderness represents a place of solitude and preparation, where God often reveals His plans.<p><b>and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</b><br>Horeb, also known as Sinai, is a sacred location where God reveals Himself to Moses and later gives the Law to Israel. This mountain is central to the Exodus narrative and the covenant relationship between God and His people. The designation "the mountain of God" underscores its significance as a place of divine encounter and revelation. Horeb is a type of Christ, as it is the site where God's presence is manifested, paralleling how Christ is the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's household, and now living in Midian.

The supposition that it means "father-in-law" has led to the identification of Jethro with Reuel, which is very unlikely. He was more probably Reuel's son, and Moses's brother-in-law. His father having died, he had succeeded to his father's position, and was at once priest and sheikh of the tribe.<p><span class= "bld">To the backside of the desert.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">behind the desert</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the fertile tract which lay behind the sandy plain stretching from the Sinaitic range to the shore of the Elanitic gulf.<p><span class= "bld">The mountain of God</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Sinai.

The word translated "father-in-law" is of much wider application, being used of almost any relation by marriage. Zipporah uses it of Moses in <a href="/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25, 26</a>; in <a href="/genesis/19-12.htm">Genesis 19:12, 14</a>, it is applied to Lot's "sons-in-law;" in other places it is used of "brothers-in-law." Its application to Jethro does not prove him to be the same person as Reuel, which the difference of name renders improbable. He was no doubt the head of the tribe at this period, having succeeded to that dignity, and to the priesthood, when Reuel died. He may have been either Reuel's son or his nephew. <span class="cmt_word">The backside of the desert</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "behind" or "beyond the desert," across the strip of sandy plain which separates the coast of the Elanitic Gulf from the mountains, to the grassy regions beyond. <span class="cmt_word">He came to the mountain of God</span>, even Horeb.
