This moment highlights Pharaoh's tendency to respond to immediate circumstances rather than genuine repentance or acknowledgment of God's power. The relief from the plague was temporary, yet Pharaoh's reaction was to revert to his previous stance, demonstrating a pattern of behavior that would continue throughout the plagues.<p><b>however, he hardened his heart</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative. It illustrates the spiritual and moral obstinacy that Pharaoh exhibited despite witnessing God's power. This hardening can be seen as both a personal choice and a divine judgment, as God had foretold this response. Theologically, it raises questions about free will and divine sovereignty, showing how God can use human decisions to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and would not listen to Moses and Aaron</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to listen to Moses and Aaron signifies his rejection of God's messengers and, by extension, God's commands. Moses and Aaron served as God's appointed leaders to deliver His message to Pharaoh. This refusal is emblematic of a broader resistance to divine authority, which is a central theme in the narrative of the Exodus. It also foreshadows the continued resistance Pharaoh would show, leading to further plagues.<p><b>just as the LORD had said</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's word and His foreknowledge of events. It reflects the prophetic nature of God's declarations to Moses before the plagues began, where God informed Moses that Pharaoh would not easily let the Israelites go. This assurance of God's sovereignty and the reliability of His word is a key element in the narrative, reinforcing the idea that God's plans are unthwarted by human resistance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is central to the account of the Exodus.

Compare how Israel &#8220;forgot His works&#8221; once pressure lifted (<a href="/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12-13</a>) and how some hearers of the word &#8220;endure only for a while&#8221; when tribulation passes (<a href="/mark/4-16.htm">Mark 4:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s mercy&#8212;granting relief&#8212;was intended to lead Pharaoh to repentance, echoing <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>, yet the opposite occurred.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He hardened his heart</b><p>&#8226; Earlier warnings stand: &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, and he would not listen&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>). This verse shows the same deliberate choice.<p>&#8226; Hardening is progressive; every refusal makes the next refusal easier.

Pharaoh&#8217;s refusal was not ignorance but rebellion.<p>&#8226; Disregarding God-given messengers equates to rejecting God Himself (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Each act of disobedience escalated the coming judgments (<a href="/exodus/9-2.htm">Exodus 9:2-3</a>), proving that selective hearing toward God always carries consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just as the LORD had said</b><p>&#8226; Long before Moses returned to Egypt, God predicted this resistance: &#8220;I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores divine foreknowledge and sovereignty; the unfolding events were no surprise to the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s stubbornness, though self-chosen, fulfilled God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan to &#8220;multiply My signs and wonders in the land&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3-5</a>), ultimately displaying God&#8217;s glory to Israel and the nations (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a> reveals the tragedy of a ruler who, once the pressure lifted, chose self-will over surrender. Relief exposed the true state of Pharaoh&#8217;s heart; instead of gratitude, he entrenched himself in rebellion, refusing God&#8217;s word through Moses and Aaron. Yet every step of defiance unfolded exactly as God had foretold, demonstrating both human responsibility and divine sovereignty. The verse challenges readers to respond to God&#8217;s mercies with soft hearts and obedience, rather than allowing momentary comfort to breed complacency and hardness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">When Pharaoh saw that there was respite.</span>--Hebrew, <span class= "ital">a breathing space.</span><p><span class= "bld">He hardened his heart.</span>--Hitherto Pharaoh's nature had not been impressed; his heart had remained dull, callous, hard.

Bad men "despise the riches of God's goodness and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth them to repentance."
