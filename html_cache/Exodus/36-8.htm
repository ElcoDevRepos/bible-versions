The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary for the Israelites during their wilderness journey, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The number ten often signifies completeness in the Bible, suggesting the thoroughness and perfection required in the tabernacle's construction. The craftsmen's skills were divinely inspired, as seen in <a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>, where God fills Bezalel and Oholiab with His Spirit to lead the work.<p><b>They were made of finely spun linen,</b><br>Finely spun linen was a luxurious and costly material, indicating the tabernacle's sacredness and the reverence due to God. Linen was often associated with purity and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints. The use of such material underscores the holiness required in approaching God.<p><b>as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn,</b><br>These colors were significant in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often associated with royalty and divinity. Blue symbolized the heavens and divine revelation, purple was a color of royalty and wealth, and scarlet represented sacrifice and atonement. The combination of these colors in the tabernacle's curtains pointed to the majesty and holiness of God, as well as the sacrificial system that would be central to Israel's worship.<p><b>with cherubim skillfully worked into them.</b><br>Cherubim are angelic beings often associated with the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life, and in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>, where they are part of God's throne chariot. Their depiction on the curtains symbolized the heavenly reality of God's throne room, making the tabernacle a microcosm of the divine presence.
