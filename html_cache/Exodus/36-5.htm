Moses, as the mediator between God and the Israelites, often received instructions and reports from the people and relayed God's commands. This reflects the hierarchical structure of leadership established by God, where Moses served as the primary human authority. It also underscores the importance of clear communication in executing God's plans.<p><b>The people are bringing more than enough</b><br>This highlights the generosity and willingness of the Israelites to contribute to the construction of the Tabernacle. It reflects a spirit of abundance and willingness to give, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. This act of giving can be seen as a response to God's deliverance from Egypt and His ongoing provision. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching on giving, where believers are encouraged to give generously and cheerfully (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>for doing the work</b><br>The "work" refers to the construction of the Tabernacle, a central place of worship for the Israelites. This was a significant task, as the Tabernacle was to be the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The work required skilled labor and materials, and the people's contributions were essential. This phrase emphasizes the communal effort and shared responsibility in fulfilling God's commands.<p><b>the LORD has commanded us to do</b><br>This underscores the divine origin of the instructions for the Tabernacle. The work was not merely a human initiative but a direct command from God. It highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands and the role of divine authority in guiding the actions of His people. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, as it symbolizes God's presence among His people, foreshadowing the incarnation of Jesus, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
