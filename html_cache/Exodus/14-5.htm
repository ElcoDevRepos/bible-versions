The "king of Egypt" refers to Pharaoh, who is a central figure in the story of Israel's liberation. The term "fled" suggests a sudden departure, emphasizing the urgency and divine intervention in Israel's escape. Historically, Egypt was a powerful empire, and the loss of a large labor force would have significant economic implications. This moment reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from bondage, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-10</a>.<p><b>Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them</b><br>The change of heart by Pharaoh and his officials highlights the fickle nature of human leadership compared to God's steadfastness. This reversal is significant, as it sets the stage for the pursuit of the Israelites, leading to the miraculous events at the Red Sea. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in Exodus, illustrating the spiritual battle between God's will and human resistance. This change of mind also underscores the theme of repentance and the consequences of ignoring divine warnings.<p><b>and said, &#8220;What have we done?</b><br>This rhetorical question reveals a moment of regret and realization of the consequences of their actions. It reflects the economic and social impact of losing the Israelite slaves, who were integral to Egypt's labor force. The question also serves as a narrative device to express the internal conflict and turmoil within the Egyptian leadership. This moment of self-reflection can be compared to the parable of the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>, where realization leads to a change in action.<p><b>We have released Israel from serving us.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "released Israel from serving us" underscores the theme of liberation and freedom that is central to the Exodus story. The Israelites' service to Egypt is contrasted with their service to God, as they are called to be a holy nation and a kingdom of priests (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This release is not just a physical liberation but also a spiritual one, as it marks the beginning of Israel's journey to becoming God's covenant people. The concept of release and redemption is a type of the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The king of Egypt, who initially allowed the Israelites to leave but later regretted his decision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they were fleeing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were enslaved in Egypt and were led by Moses out of bondage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/officials_of_pharaoh.htm">Officials of Pharaoh</a></b><br>Advisors and leaders in Egypt who influenced Pharaoh's decision-making.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites leaving Egypt, marking a significant moment of deliverance in biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_regret_and_reversal.htm">The Danger of Regret and Reversal</a></b><br>Pharaoh's change of heart serves as a warning against making decisions based on temporary emotions or pressures.

The emigration left Eastern Egypt a solitude, suspended all the royal works that were in progress, threw the whole course of commerce and business into disorder. Beforehand, neither the king nor the people had understood what the loss of six hundred thousand labourers--some of them highly skilled--would be. When Israel was gone they realised it; consequently both king and people regretted what they had done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - THE PURSUIT OF ISRAEL BY THE EGYPTIANS. A short respite from suffering was sufficient to enable Pharaoh to recover from his extreme alarm. No further deaths had followed on the destruction of the firstborn; and he might think no further danger was to be apprehended. The worst of Moses' threats had been accomplished- perhaps Jehovah had no more arrows in his quiver. At any rate, as he realised to himself what it would be to lose altogether the services of so vast a body of slaves, many of them highly skilled in different arts, he more and more regretted the permission which he had given. Under these circumstances intelligence was brought him of the change which the Israelites had made in their route, and the dangerous position into which they had Brought themselves. Upon this he resolved to start in pursuit, with such troops as he could hastily muster. As his chariots were six hundred, we may presume that his footmen were at least 100,000, all trained and disciplined soldiers, accustomed to warfare. The timid horde of escaped slaves, unused to war, though it might be five or six times as numerous as his host, was not likely to resist it. Pharaoh no doubt expected an unconditional surrender on the part of the Israelites, as soon as they saw his forces. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was told the King of Egypt that the people fled</span>. Pharaoh, when he let the Israelites go, must have felt tolerably certain that they would not voluntarily return. Formally, however, he had only consented to their going a three days' journey into the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>). When, being at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness, they did not enter it, but marched southward to Pi-hahiroth, the Egyptians might naturally report that instead of sacrificing, they were flying - hasting forwards - placing as much distance as they could between themselves and the Egyptian headquarters. But this report alone would scarcely have moved Pharaoh to action. It was in the accompanying circumstances, in the particular line of route, that he thought to find his opportunity. The people "were entangled" (ver. 3). They might be taken at a disadvantage, and might be reduced to choosing between starvation and a. return to Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of Pharaoh, and of his servants, was turned against the people</span>. The reaction of feeling was not confined to Pharaoh. His subjects participated in it. The loss of such a large body of labourers would be generally felt as a severe blow to the prosperity of the nation. It would affect all classes. The poor labourers might be benefited; but the employers of labour are the influential classes, and they would be injured. So "Pharaoh's servants" were of one mind with their master, and they "turned against" the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Why have we done this?</span> In the retrospect, the afflictions which they had suffered did not seem so very great. They at any rate had survived them, and were not perhaps even seriously impoverished. Royal favour will find a way of making up any losses which court minions have suffered, out of the general taxation of the country. But in prospect, the loss of 600,000 (more or less skilled) labourers appeared a terrible thing. The official class was quite ready to make a strenuous effort to avert the loss. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/14-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
