The release of the Israelites was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>, where God foretold the liberation of his descendants from bondage. The Exodus is a pivotal event in Israel's history, symbolizing redemption and foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<p><b>God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines</b><br>The road through the land of the Philistines, known as the Via Maris, was a major trade route connecting Egypt to Canaan. It was the most direct path to the Promised Land. However, the Philistines were a formidable military power, and God, in His wisdom, chose a different route to protect the Israelites from immediate conflict. This decision highlights God's providential care and understanding of His people's limitations.<p><b>though it was shorter</b><br>The shorter route would have been more convenient and quicker, but God's guidance often transcends human logic. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours. The longer journey allowed the Israelites to develop their identity as God's chosen people and to learn reliance on Him.<p><b>For God said, &#8220;If the people face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.&#8221;</b><br>God's concern for the Israelites' potential fear and discouragement underscores His compassion and understanding of human frailty. The Israelites had been enslaved for generations and were not prepared for immediate warfare. This statement also reflects God's desire for His people to trust Him fully, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-29.htm">Deuteronomy 1:29-31</a>, where God reassures them of His presence and protection. The possibility of returning to Egypt symbolizes a regression to bondage, contrasting with the freedom and new life God offers, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who finally let the Israelites go after a series of plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were enslaved in Egypt and are now being led to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_the_philistines.htm">The Land of the Philistines</a></b><br>A region that lay along the shorter route to Canaan, known for its warrior inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign leader and protector of the Israelites, guiding them with wisdom and foresight.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which the Israelites are being delivered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_guidance.htm">God's Sovereign Guidance</a></b><br>God knows the best path for us, even when it seems longer or more difficult.

The starting point of the journey being Tanis or Rameses, in the Eastern Delta, not far from the sea, he sees that the shortest, and apparently the easiest, route for the Israelites to have pursued would have been that which led along the coast, from Tanis to Pelusium, thence to Rhinocolura, and from Rhinocolura to Gaza, Ascalon, and Ashdod, the chief towns of the Philistines. The distance along this line was not more than about 200 miles, and might have been accomplished in a fortnight. He anticipates an inquiry, Why did they not pursue this route? The reply is, that such was not the will of God; and the reason why it was not His will is further given--"The people would probably have repented when they saw war, and would have returned to Egypt." It is implied that the Philistines were already a strong and warlike people, which they may well have been, though not mentioned in the contemporary Egyptian monuments. The Egyptians mention by name very few of the nations of Syria, and the few names which they put on record can seldom be identified.<p><span class= "bld">Although that was near.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">because that was near.</span> God did not, because it was near, lead them that way, but another.<p><span class= "bld">When they see war.</span>--If the Philistines are to be regarded as identical with the "Purusata" of the Egyptian remains, they must be viewed as one of the most warlike people of the time. Even leaving aside this identification--which is very uncertain--we must view them as one of the most important of the tribes inhabiting the lower Syrian region. In Joshua's time they already possessed their five strong fortresses--Gaza, Ascalon, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a>); and during the period of the Judges they raised themselves to the leading position in the Palestinian region. Palestine derives its name from them, and would not have obtained the name unless they had been a very remarkable race. We can well understand that the Israelites after four centuries of slavery would have been an ill match for the Philistines, and that, if defeated or intimidated, they might have felt that no course was open to them but a return to Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17-20.</span> - THE DIRECTION OF THE JOURNEY. - The direct road from Tanis to Palestine - a road much frequented under the nineteenth dynasty - lay along the coast of the Mediterranean, and conducted to Philistia. If we look at the map, and observe the position of Tanis (now San) on the old Tanitic branch of the Nile, now nearly dried up, we shall see that the route which would naturally suggest itself to any one wishing to proceed to the Holy Land from Tanis would be one running almost due east, from Tanis to Pelusium, and from Pelusium, south of Lake Serbonis, to Rhinocolura; and thence, following the course of the coast to Gaza, Ascalon, and Ashdod, the chief towns of the Philistine country. It is true that a marsh region intervenes between Tanis and Pelusium which might seem to bar the route; but the Egyptian remains show that, in the times of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, this obstacle was surmounted by means of an embankment which was carried across it, and that a direct road thus connected the two cities. Moses, at this point of his narrative, being about to trace the onward march of the Israelites from Succoth to Etham, in the direction of the Red Sea, anticipated, it would seem, an objection on the part of his reader, who would naturally ask, Why was not the direct route eastward taken and Canaan entered on the south-west after some half-dozen marches? In verses 17, 18, he gives the reply - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> God led them, they did not determine their own route; and <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> God would not lead them by the direct route, because it would have conducted them to the Philistine country, and the Philistines were strong, and would have resisted the invasion by force of arms. Hence it was that the southern or south-eastern route was taken in preference to the northern one - and that the second stage in the journey was from Succoth to Etham (verse 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Although that was near</span>. Rather "because it was near" (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>., "<span class="accented">God</span> did not, because it was near, lead them this way, but a longer one." <span class="cmt_word">Lest peradveature the people repeat when they see war</span>. The Philistines were a powerful and warlike race half a century after this, in the time of Joshua, and were masters of the five important cities of Gaze, Ascalon, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron, which seem to have formed a confederacy (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>). It would appear that their strength was already considerable, and that the Israelites, though perhaps more numerous, were incapable of coping with them, being wholly unaccustomed to war, The Israelites were therefore not allowed to take this route, which would have brought upon them at once a severe trial, and might have led to their voluntary return into Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/13-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
