This bread was a continual reminder of God's covenant and sustenance. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), drawing a parallel to the sustenance and presence of God symbolized by the showbread.<p><b>on the table</b><br>The table for the Bread of the Presence was located in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle, opposite the lampstand and near the altar of incense. Made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold, it was a symbol of God's holiness and the sacredness of His provision. The table's design and placement highlight the importance of order and reverence in worship, reflecting God's instructions for His dwelling place among the Israelites.<p><b>before Me</b><br>The phrase "before Me" indicates the bread's placement in the presence of God, signifying a continual offering and acknowledgment of His sovereignty. This positioning underscores the idea that all offerings and acts of worship are ultimately directed towards God Himself. It also reflects the intimate relationship between God and His people, as the bread was always to be in His presence, just as believers are called to live continually in the presence of God.<p><b>at all times</b><br>The command for the bread to be before God "at all times" emphasizes the perpetual nature of God's covenant with Israel. It signifies an ongoing relationship and constant reliance on God's provision. This continuity is mirrored in the New Testament through the eternal presence of Christ with His followers, as He promises to be with them "always, to the very end of the age" (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The perpetual nature of the bread also points to the eternal sustenance and life found in Jesus Christ, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/table_of_showbread.htm">Table of Showbread</a></b><br>A sacred table located in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle, where the Bread of the Presence was placed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_of_the_presence.htm">Bread of the Presence</a></b><br>Twelve loaves of bread representing the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing God's provision and presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were to maintain the Bread of the Presence as a perpetual offering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_god's_provision.htm">Symbol of God's Provision</a></b><br>The Bread of the Presence serves as a reminder of God's continual provision for His people.

Here we have at once the object of the table, and its name, explained. The table was to have set upon it continually twelve loaves, or cakes, of bread (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5</a>), which were to be renewed weekly on the sabbath-day (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 8), the stale loaves being at the same time consumed by the priests in the holy place. These twelve loaves or cakes were to constitute a continual thank-offering to God from the twelve tribes of Israel in return for the bless-Lugs of life and sustenance which they received from him. The bread was called "bread of face," or "bread of presence," because it was set before the "face" or "presence" of God, which dwelt in the holy of holies. The Septuagint renders the phrase by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "loaves that are face to face" - St. Matthew by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "loaves of setting-forth" - whence the <span class="accented">Schaubrode</span> of Luther, and our "shew-bread," which is a paraphrase rather than a translation. <p> CHAPTER 25:31 THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK (vers. 31-40). Though the holy of holies was always dark, unless when lighted by. the glory of God (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34, 35</a>), the holy place, in which many of the priests' functions were to be performed, was to be always kept light. In the day-time sufficient light entered from the porch in front; but, as evening drew on, some artificial illumination was required. In connection with this object, the golden candlestick, or rather lamp-stand, was designed, which, together with its appurtenances, is described in the remainder of the chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/25-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1445;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Presence</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the table</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;ul&#183;&#7717;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7979.htm">Strong's 7979: </a> </span><span class="str2">A table, a meal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">before Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;nay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at all times.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;m&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8548.htm">Strong's 8548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Continuance, constant, ellipt, the regular, sacrifice</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">OT Law: Exodus 25:30 You shall set bread of the presence (Exo.
