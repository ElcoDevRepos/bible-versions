The Israelites' grumbling reflects a recurring theme of doubt and lack of faith, despite witnessing God's miraculous deliverance from Egypt. This echoes earlier instances of grumbling in <a href="/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a> and foreshadows future complaints in the wilderness. It underscores the human tendency to forget God's past faithfulness when faced with new challenges.<p><b>Tell them, &#8216;At twilight you will eat meat,</b><br>God's promise to provide meat at twilight signifies His provision and care for the Israelites' physical needs. The provision of quail, as described later in the chapter, is a miraculous event that demonstrates God's power over creation. This event is geographically significant as quail migration patterns in the region could naturally bring flocks to the area, yet the timing and abundance are divinely orchestrated. This provision prefigures the abundance found in Christ, who provides for both physical and spiritual needs (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and in the morning you will be filled with bread.</b><br>The morning provision of manna is a daily miracle that sustains the Israelites throughout their wilderness journey. Manna, described as bread from heaven, is a type of Christ, who is the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-33</a>). This daily provision teaches reliance on God and foreshadows the Lord's Prayer petition for daily bread (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). The regularity of manna emphasizes God's faithfulness and the importance of daily dependence on Him.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.&#8217;</b><br>This statement underscores the purpose of God's provision: to reveal His identity and establish His covenant relationship with Israel. The phrase "I am the LORD your God" is a recurring declaration of God's sovereignty and personal relationship with His people, seen throughout the Pentateuch. It serves as a reminder of the covenant made at Sinai and the unique relationship between God and Israel. This revelation of God's character and faithfulness is foundational for understanding His redemptive plan, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>A geographical location where the Israelites camped and experienced God's provision of manna and quail.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders appointed by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who provides for His people and reveals His power and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/provision_of_manna_and_quail.htm">Provision of Manna and Quail</a></b><br>A miraculous event where God provides food for the Israelites, demonstrating His care and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_hears_our_complaints.htm">God Hears Our Complaints</a></b><br>God is attentive to the cries and complaints of His people.

Literally, "between the two evenings." For the meaning of the phrase, see the comment on Exodus 12:6. Ye shall eat flesh. The quails, as appears by the subsequent narrative, were supplied, not regularly, but only on rare occasions; in fact (so far as appears), only here in the wilderness of Sin, and at Kibroth-hattaavah in the wilderness of Paran (<a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31-34</a>). They were not a necessary, but an indulgence. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall know that I am</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> The miracle of the manna, and the timely appearance of the quails at the hour announced, will sufficiently show that it is God himself who has you under his charge and watches over you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the grumbling</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;l&#363;n&#183;n&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8519.htm">Strong's 8519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Exalted, lofty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Israelites.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Tell them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(dab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;At</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_996.htm">Strong's 996: </a> </span><span class="str2">An interval, space between</span><br /><br /><span class="word">twilight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;ar&#183;ba&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
