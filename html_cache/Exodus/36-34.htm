Gold, a symbol of purity and value, was used extensively in the Tabernacle's construction, indicating the sacredness of the space where God would dwell among His people. This act of overlaying with gold can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate manifestation of God's glory and purity. The use of gold also connects to the heavenly visions in Revelation, where the New Jerusalem is described as having streets of pure gold.<p><b>and made gold rings to hold the crossbars</b><br>The gold rings served a practical purpose, providing a means to secure the crossbars that stabilized the Tabernacle's structure. This detail highlights the importance of order and stability in God's design, ensuring that the Tabernacle was both beautiful and functional. The use of gold for the rings emphasizes the sacredness of even the smallest components of the Tabernacle. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching that every part of the body of Christ, the Church, is valuable and has a purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>He also overlaid the crossbars with gold</b><br>The crossbars, like the frames, were overlaid with gold, further emphasizing the unity and coherence of the Tabernacle's design. This act symbolizes the pervasive holiness required in the presence of God. The crossbars' function of holding the structure together can be seen as a type of Christ, who holds all things together (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).
