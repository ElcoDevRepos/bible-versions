It reflects the unique relationship Moses had with God, often described as speaking "face to face" (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>). This communication underscores the seriousness of the message and the authority with which it is delivered.<p><b>Tell the Israelites</b><br>Moses is instructed to convey God's message to the Israelites, highlighting his leadership and prophetic role. This reflects the covenant relationship where God communicates His will through chosen leaders. It also underscores the communal aspect of the covenant, where the entire nation is accountable to God's commands.<p><b>&#8216;You are a stiff-necked people.</b><br>The term "stiff-necked" is a metaphor for stubbornness and resistance to guidance, often used in the Old Testament to describe Israel's rebellious nature (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>). This imagery is drawn from the behavior of oxen that resist the yoke, symbolizing Israel's unwillingness to submit to God's authority. It serves as a warning and a call to repentance.<p><b>If I should go with you for a single moment, I would destroy you.</b><br>This statement reflects God's holiness and the severity of Israel's sin. The presence of a holy God among a sinful people poses a danger due to His righteous judgment. It echoes the theme of God's justice and the need for atonement, pointing to the sacrificial system and ultimately to Christ's atoning work.<p><b>Now take off your jewelry</b><br>The removal of jewelry is a sign of repentance and mourning. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, adornments were associated with joy and celebration. By removing them, the Israelites demonstrate humility and contrition. This act is a physical manifestation of their acknowledgment of sin and a desire to return to God's favor.<p><b>and I will decide what to do with you.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of divine deliberation, suggesting that God's judgment is not arbitrary but considers the people's response. It reflects God's mercy and willingness to forgive upon genuine repentance. This open-ended statement leaves room for intercession, as seen in Moses' subsequent pleas for the people, and foreshadows the ultimate intercession of Christ on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and just, communicating His displeasure with the Israelites' behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet of Israel, acting as an intermediary between God and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, described here as "stiff-necked," indicating their stubbornness and rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites are journeying after their exodus from Egypt, a place of testing and revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_calf_incident.htm">The Golden Calf Incident</a></b><br>The backdrop to this passage, where the Israelites had sinned by creating and worshiping a golden calf, leading to God's anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_stubbornness.htm">Understanding Stubbornness</a></b><br>The term "stiff-necked" (Hebrew: qesheh-oref) implies a refusal to submit to God's authority.

He is not reacting impulsively; He speaks with deliberate clarity, just as He had done at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and later &#8220;face to face&#8221; with Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). By reminding us that the LORD spoke, the text underscores:<p>&#8226; Authority &#8211; what follows is not Moses&#8217; idea; it carries divine weight (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Relationship &#8211; the covenant mediator hears directly from God, anticipating the ultimate Mediator, Christ (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell the Israelites</b><p>Moses must relay God&#8217;s exact words.

Other echoes: <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>. Key truths:<p>&#8226; Sin is not a slip; it is stubborn resistance.<p>&#8226; God calls sin what it is before He offers mercy.<p>Personal application arises naturally: the Lord still confronts obstinacy (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I should go with you for a single moment, I would destroy you</b><p>Holiness and sin cannot coexist without judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>).

Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Put away symbols of past rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Humble yourself&#8212;ornament in Scripture often symbolizes pride (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Repentance is visible and tangible; faith produces deeds (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will decide what to do with you</b><p>The future is placed solely in God&#8217;s hands.

(so most recent commentators, as Keil, Kalisch, etc.) The message was sent to the people after their repentance, and in reply to it. It was not, however, as our version makes it, a threat of destruction, but only a repetition of the statement made in ver. 2, that, <span class="accented">if</span> God went up with them, the probable result would be their destruction. Translate - "Ye are a stiff-necked people; were I for one moment to go up in the midst of thee, I should destroy thee," <span class="cmt_word">Put off thy ornaments</span>. The command seems strange, when we had just been told that "no man did put on him his ornaments" (ver 4) but the word translated put off probably means "lay aside altogether."
