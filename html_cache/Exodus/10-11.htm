This reflects the cultural context of ancient Egypt, where men often represented the family or community in religious and civic matters. Pharaoh's offer is a strategic attempt to maintain control over the Israelites by keeping their families and possessions in Egypt, ensuring their return. This phrase highlights the ongoing struggle between Pharaoh's hardened heart and God's command, illustrating the spiritual battle between obedience to God and worldly authority.<p><b>since that is what you have been requesting.&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's statement is a misrepresentation of Moses' actual request, which was for all the Israelites, including women and children, to go and worship the LORD. This reflects Pharaoh's attempt to manipulate the situation to his advantage. It also underscores the theme of deception and misunderstanding that runs throughout the Exodus narrative. The request for worship is central to the Israelites' identity and mission, as seen in other scriptures where worship is a communal and inclusive act (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>).<p><b>And Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh&#8217;s presence.</b><br>This phrase indicates the abrupt and forceful nature of Pharaoh's rejection. The act of driving Moses and Aaron out signifies Pharaoh's anger and the tension between him and the representatives of God. It also foreshadows the increasing severity of the plagues and the eventual liberation of the Israelites. The rejection of God's messengers is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in the rejection of prophets and, ultimately, in the rejection of Jesus Christ (e.g., <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). This moment is a pivotal point in the narrative, emphasizing the hardening of Pharaoh's heart and the inevitability of God's will being accomplished.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is obstinate and refuses to let the Israelites go to worship the LORD, demonstrating his hardened heart.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to demand their release from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and spokesperson, who assists in communicating God's demands to Pharaoh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of oppression and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demands the release of His people to worship Him, showcasing His sovereignty and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to let the Israelites go is a powerful example of how pride and stubbornness can lead to one's downfall.

Pharaoh seems to argue that the request to "serve the Lord" implied the departure of the men only, as if women and children could not offer an acceptable service. But he must have known that women and children attended his own national festivals. (See the comment on ver. 9.) Probably, he knew that his argument was sophistical. <span class="cmt_word">And they were driven out</span>. Literally, "One drove them out." Pharaoh's manifest displeasure was an indication to the court officials that he wished the interview ended, and as the brothers did not at once voluntarily quit the presence, an officer thrust them out. This was an insult not previously offered them, and shows how Pharaoh's rage increased as he saw more and more clearly that he would have to yield and allow the departure of the entire nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/10-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">only the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
