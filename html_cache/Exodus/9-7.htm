In the context of ancient Egypt, officials were often used to gather information and report back to the ruler. This action demonstrates Pharaoh's continued resistance to the signs and wonders performed by God through Moses and Aaron. It also highlights the bureaucratic nature of Pharaoh's court, where decisions were often based on reports from trusted officials.<p><b>and found that none of the livestock of the Israelites had died.</b><br>This phrase underscores the miraculous nature of God's protection over the Israelites. In the context of the plagues, this distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites serves as a sign of God's covenantal faithfulness to His people. The survival of the Israelite livestock contrasts with the devastation experienced by the Egyptians, emphasizing God's power and the fulfillment of His promises. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt and serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where believers are spared from spiritual death.<p><b>But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened,</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative. It illustrates the spiritual blindness and stubbornness that can result from persistent sin and rebellion against God. This hardening can be seen as both a divine judgment and a personal choice, reflecting the complex interplay between human free will and divine sovereignty. Theologically, it serves as a warning against resisting God's will and highlights the consequences of pride and unbelief.<p><b>and he would not let the people go.</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites demonstrates his defiance against God's command and his unwillingness to acknowledge God's authority. This resistance sets the stage for the subsequent plagues and the eventual deliverance of the Israelites. It also reflects the broader theme of liberation and redemption that runs throughout the Bible, pointing to the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ. The narrative encourages believers to trust in God's timing and sovereignty, even in the face of opposition and delay.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against letting the Israelites go, despite witnessing God's power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/officials.htm">Officials</a></b><br>Sent by Pharaoh to verify the condition of the Israelites' livestock, confirming God's protection over His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, living in Egypt, whose livestock were spared from the plague.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God demonstrated His power through plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague.htm">Plague</a></b><br>A divine judgment from God, specifically targeting the livestock of the Egyptians while sparing the Israelites'.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God demonstrates His power and protection over His people, distinguishing them from the Egyptians.
