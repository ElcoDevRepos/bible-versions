It emphasizes the importance of following God's instructions precisely. The Passover meal is not just a regular meal but a sacred observance with specific guidelines, symbolizing obedience and readiness for deliverance.<p><b>You must be fully dressed for travel:</b><br>The Israelites were to be prepared for immediate departure from Egypt. This instruction signifies readiness and anticipation of God's deliverance. In a broader sense, it reflects the Christian call to be spiritually prepared for Christ's return, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>).<p><b>With your sandals on your feet:</b><br>Wearing sandals indicates readiness for a journey. In ancient times, removing sandals was customary when entering a home, so keeping them on signifies that the Israelites were not to settle but to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. This can be seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to be pilgrims and sojourners in the world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<p><b>And your staff in your hand:</b><br>The staff is a symbol of support and guidance during travel. It represents God's provision and protection as the Israelites embark on their journey. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, where the psalmist speaks of God's rod and staff providing comfort.<p><b>You are to eat in haste:</b><br>Eating in haste underscores the urgency of the situation. The Israelites were to be ready to leave Egypt quickly, without delay. This reflects the urgency of responding to God's call and the immediacy of salvation, as emphasized in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>, "Now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation."<p><b>It is the LORD&#8217;s Passover:</b><br>The Passover is a pivotal event in Israel's history, marking their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. It is a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice, as He is referred to as "our Passover lamb" (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The blood of the lamb, which protected the Israelites from the angel of death, prefigures the blood of Christ, which saves believers from eternal death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are in bondage in Egypt and are about to be delivered by God through the Passover event.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of bondage and oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_passover.htm">The LORD's Passover</a></b><br>A pivotal event where God passes over the houses of the Israelites, sparing them from the plague of the firstborn, marking their deliverance from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go, leading to the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/readiness_and_obedience.htm">Readiness and Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were instructed to eat the Passover meal in a state of readiness, symbolizing their faith and obedience to God's command.

The Passover belongs to the LORD, and its fulfillment in Christ calls believers today to live alert, equipped, and eager for the deliverance He secured and the greater exodus still to come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Thus shall ye eat it.</span>--The injunctions which follow are not repeated in any later part of the Law, and were not generally regarded as binding at any Passover after the first. They all had reference to the impending departure of the Israelites, who were to eat the Passover prepared as for a journey. The long robe (<span class= "ital">beged</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> usually allowed to flow loosely around the person, was to be gathered together, and fastened about the loins with a girdle; sandals, not commonly worn inside the house, were to be put on the feet, and a walking-stick was to be held in one hand. The meal was to be eaten "in haste," as liable to be interrupted at any moment by a summons to quit Egypt and set out for Canaan. Some such attitude befits Christians at all times, since they know not when the summons may come to them requiring them to quit the Egypt of this world and start for the heavenly country.<p><span class= "bld">It is the Lord's passover.</span>--The word "passover" (<span class= "ital">pesakh</span>) is here used for the first time. It is supposed by some to be of Egyptian origin, and to signify primarily "a spreading out of wings, so as to protect. But the meaning "pass over" is still regarded by many of the best Hebraists as the primary and most proper sense, and the word itself as Semitic. It occurs in the geographic name Tiphsach (Thapsacus), borne by the place where it was usual to cross, or "pass over," the Euphrates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With your loins girded</span>, etc. Completely prepared, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to start on your journey - with the loose wrapper (<span class="accented">beged</span>), ordinarily worn, collected together and fastened by a girdle about the waist; with sandals on the feet, which were not commonly worn in houses; and with walking-sticks in the hand. There were some Jews who regarded these directions as of perpetual obligation; but the general view was that they applied to the first occasion only, when alone they would have answered any useful purpose. <span class="cmt_word">You shall eat it in haste</span>. As not knowing at what moment you may be summoned to start on your journey, and as having to see to the burning of the bones after the flesh was eaten, which would take some time. <span class="cmt_word">It is the Lord's Passover</span>. Very emphatic words! "This is no common meal," they seem to say, "it is not even an ordinary sacrificial repast. The lamb is Jehovah's. It is his pass-sign - the mark of his protection, the precious means of your preservation from death. As such view it; and though ye eat it in haste, eat it with reverence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is how</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
