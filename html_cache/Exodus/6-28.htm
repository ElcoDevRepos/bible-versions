In biblical narratives, the mention of a particular day often signifies a divine appointment or a significant turning point in God's plan. This sets the stage for a pivotal moment in the story of the Exodus.<p><b>that the LORD spoke</b><br>The LORD, represented by the tetragrammaton YHWH, is the covenant name of God, highlighting His eternal, self-existent nature. The act of God speaking underscores His direct involvement and communication with His chosen leaders. This divine communication is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God reveals His will and instructions to His prophets and leaders, as seen with figures like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and later, the prophets.<p><b>to Moses</b><br>Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage. His life is marked by divine encounters, beginning with the burning bush (Exodus 3). Moses serves as a type of Christ, a deliverer and mediator between God and His people. His leadership and faith are pivotal in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>in Egypt</b><br>Egypt, a powerful and influential civilization in the ancient world, serves as the backdrop for the Israelites' enslavement and subsequent deliverance. The historical and archaeological context of Egypt during this period provides insights into the conditions and culture that the Israelites experienced. Egypt is often symbolic of sin and bondage in biblical typology, representing the world from which God's people are delivered. The Exodus from Egypt is a foundational event in Israel's history, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance from sin through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals Himself to Moses and commissions him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, called by God to confront Pharaoh and lead His people out of slavery in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of bondage and oppression from which God plans to deliver His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_revelation.htm">The Day of Revelation</a></b><br>This refers to the specific time when God communicates His will to Moses, emphasizing the immediacy and importance of God's message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Timing and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's revelation to Moses occurs at a specific time, underscoring His control over history and events.
