This inspection signifies accountability and adherence to God's commands. The Tabernacle was a portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, and its construction was detailed in earlier chapters of Exodus. The inspection reflects the importance of obedience and precision in following God's instructions, as seen in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>, where God provides detailed plans for the Tabernacle.<p><b>and saw that they had accomplished it</b><br>The phrase indicates that the Israelites, under the leadership of skilled artisans like Bezalel and Oholiab, completed the work. This accomplishment was a collective effort, demonstrating unity and dedication among the people. The successful completion of the Tabernacle's construction is a testament to the Israelites' willingness to follow God's commands, contrasting with their earlier disobedience, such as the incident with the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's specific instructions. The detailed commands given by God for the Tabernacle's construction are found in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>. The Israelites' adherence to these commands reflects their reverence and commitment to God. This obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the blessings that come from following God's will, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>.<p><b>So Moses blessed them.</b><br>Moses' blessing signifies approval and divine favor. In the Old Testament, blessings often conveyed prosperity, protection, and success. This blessing can be seen as a precursor to the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate blessing found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, bringing spiritual blessings to all believers, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.
