This choice of material symbolizes the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. Acacia trees were abundant in the Sinai region, making them a practical choice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The use of acacia wood also points to the humanity of Christ, who was both enduring and incorruptible.<p><b>for carrying the table</b><br>The table referred to here is the Table of Showbread, which held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and fellowship with His people. The poles were necessary for transporting the table as the Israelites moved through the wilderness, emphasizing the mobility of God's presence with His people. This mobility foreshadows the New Testament understanding of God dwelling not in a fixed temple but within the hearts of believers.<p><b>and overlaid them with gold.</b><br>Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was used extensively in the tabernacle to signify the holiness and majesty of God. The overlaying of the acacia wood with gold represents the divine nature of Christ covering His humanity. This duality is a type of the hypostatic union, where Jesus is both fully God and fully man. The use of gold also connects to the heavenly reality, as seen in Revelation, where the New Jerusalem is described as having streets of pure gold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the table of showbread.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/acacia_wood.htm">Acacia Wood</a></b><br>A durable and resistant wood used extensively in the construction of the Tabernacle's furnishings, symbolizing incorruptibility and strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_overlay.htm">Gold Overlay</a></b><br>Represents purity, divinity, and the glory of God, used to cover the acacia wood, signifying the divine nature covering human effort.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_table_of_showbread.htm">The Table of Showbread</a></b><br>A sacred piece of furniture in the Tabernacle, symbolizing God's provision and fellowship with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_materials.htm">Symbolism of Materials</a></b><br>The use of acacia wood and gold in the Tabernacle's construction teaches us about the combination of human effort and divine grace.
