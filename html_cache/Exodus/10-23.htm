This darkness was so intense that it was tangible, a supernatural event beyond a mere solar eclipse or sandstorm. In biblical context, darkness often symbolizes judgment and separation from God (e.g., <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>). The inability to see others highlights the isolation and fear that the Egyptians experienced, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment against Pharaoh's hardened heart.<p><b>and for three days no one left his place</b><br>The duration of three days is significant in biblical narratives, often representing a period of trial or transition (e.g., <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). The confinement of the Egyptians to their homes underscores the totality of the plague's impact, rendering them helpless and immobilized. This period of darkness contrasts with the light and liberation that God would soon bring to the Israelites, foreshadowing their imminent exodus from Egypt.<p><b>Yet all the Israelites had light in their dwellings</b><br>This miraculous provision of light for the Israelites serves as a testament to God's covenant faithfulness and protection over His chosen people. It distinguishes the Israelites from the Egyptians, highlighting the theme of divine favor and separation. This light can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), bringing spiritual illumination and salvation. The distinction between light and darkness here prefigures the ultimate deliverance and redemption that God provides through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who refused to let the Israelites go, leading to the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who conveyed God's commands to Pharaoh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where the plagues occurred.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, living in Egypt, who were spared from the plague of darkness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague_of_darkness.htm">Plague of Darkness</a></b><br>The ninth plague sent by God upon Egypt, causing complete darkness for three days.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The plague of darkness demonstrates God's absolute control over creation.

No one quitted his house. Mr. Millington imagines that they all sat "glued to their seats" (<span class= "ital">Plagues of Egypt,</span> p. 159), but this savours of over-literalism. It is not necessary to suppose that they had no artificial light, or that they ceased to move from chamber to chamber. What the writer intends to note is that all business and all intercourse with neighbours was suspended. No one quitted the house in which he was when the darkness began.<p><span class= "bld">All the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span>--The visitation, whatever it was, did not extend to the land of Goshen.

Or, "Man did not see his brother." The descriptive phrases previously used are poetic, and might imply many different degrees of obscurity. This seems distinctly to shew that pitch darkness is meant. Such absolute obscurity is far beyond anything which the khamsin produces, even when it is most severe, and indicates the miraculous character of the visitation. <span class="cmt_word">Neither rose any from his place for three days</span>. It is not meant that no one moved about his house, but that no one quitted it. (Compare <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>, where the phrase used is similar.) No one went out into the unnatural darkness out of doors, which he dreaded. All stayed at home, and did what they had to do by the artificial light of lamps or torches. <span class="cmt_word">All the children of Israel had light in their dwellings</span>. It is not explained how this was effected. Some suppose that the sand-storm did not extend to the land of Goshen. But in that case, such Egyptians as lived among the Israelites - their neighbours. (<a href="/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a>) - would have shared the benefit, which seems not to have been the case. I should rather suppose that the storm was general, and that the Israelites were supplied with a light, not that of the sun, by miracle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/10-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">could see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">each other,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
