Moses, as a prophet and leader, ensures that God's commands are preserved for future generations. This act of writing signifies the transition from oral tradition to written scripture, which is foundational for the development of the Bible. The words of the LORD likely refer to the laws and commandments given in the preceding chapters, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This practice of documentation is seen throughout the Pentateuch and is crucial for maintaining the integrity and continuity of God's instructions.<p><b>Early the next morning he got up and built an altar at the base of the mountain,</b><br>The timing "early the next morning" indicates Moses' prompt obedience and dedication to fulfilling God's commands. The construction of an altar signifies a place of worship and sacrifice, essential elements in the covenant relationship. The location "at the base of the mountain" is significant as it is near Mount Sinai, where God revealed Himself to Moses and the Israelites. This geographical setting underscores the sacredness of the event and the proximity to God's presence. Altars in ancient times were central to worship and served as a physical reminder of divine encounters and covenants.<p><b>along with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.</b><br>The twelve pillars represent the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing the unity and collective identity of the nation under God's covenant. Each pillar stands for a tribe, indicating that the covenant is inclusive and binding for all of Israel. This act of setting up pillars is reminiscent of other biblical instances where stones or pillars are used as memorials or witnesses to significant events, such as Jacob's pillar at Bethel. The number twelve is significant throughout scripture, often representing completeness and divine order, as seen in the twelve apostles in the New Testament. This typology points to the continuity of God's plan from the Old to the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses acts as the mediator between God and the Israelites.
