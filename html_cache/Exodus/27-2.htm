In ancient Near Eastern culture, horns were emblematic of authority and might. The four corners may represent the universality of the altar's purpose, extending to all directions and peoples.<p><b>so that the horns are of one piece</b><br>The instruction for the horns to be of one piece with the altar emphasizes the unity and integrity of the structure.

Later narratives show the horns as places of refuge (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50-53</a>), highlighting the altar as both a site of sacrifice and a symbol of mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that the horns are of one piece</b><p>&#8226; The horns were not to be separate parts attached later; they were to rise seamlessly from the altar itself (<a href="/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This &#8220;one piece&#8221; design underscores unity and integrity&#8212;no division between altar and horns, just as there is no division between God&#8217;s justice and mercy (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadows Christ, whose saving work is not an add-on but intrinsic to His person (<a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The single casting also ensured durability, reflecting God&#8217;s unchanging plan of redemption (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And overlay it with bronze</b><p>&#8226; Bronze, a durable metal resistant to fire, covered the wooden structure, enabling the altar to withstand continual burning (<a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, bronze often speaks of judgment refined by fire (<a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>;

The overlay also protected the altar, ensuring its service endured as long as Israel journeyed&#8212;just as the eternal value of Christ&#8217;s atonement never diminishes (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a> weaves together rich symbolism: four horns broadcasting universal atonement, their seamless construction revealing God&#8217;s unified plan, and the bronze overlay portraying judgment borne so mercy can flow.

On the contrary, horns were, so far as is known, peculiar to Israelite altars. Originally, they would seem to have been mere ornaments at the four upper corners, but ultimately they came to be regarded as essential to an altar, and the virtue of the altar was thought to lie especially in them. The victims were bound to them (<a href="/psalms/118-27.htm" title="God is the LORD, which has showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.">Psalm 118:27</a>); criminals clung to them (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm" title="And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm" title="Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 2:28</a>); and the blood of sin offerings was smeared upon them for purposes of expiation (<a href="/exodus/29-12.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood of the bullock, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-9.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:">Leviticus 9:9</a>, &c.). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horns of it</span>. Literally, "its horns." Horns were not usual adjuncts of altars; indeed they seem to have been peculiar to those of the Israelites. They were projections at the four top comers, probably not unlike the horns of bulls, whence their name. Criminals clung to them when they took sanctuary (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>); and the blood of sin-offerings was smeared upon them (<a href="/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-9.htm">Leviticus 9:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-18.htm">Leviticus 16:18</a>, etc.). Victims also were sometimes, when about to be sacrificed, bound to them (<a href="/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>). According to Kalisch, "The horns were symbolical of power, of protection and help; and at the same time of glory and salvation." <span class="cmt_word">His horns shall be of the same</span>. Part and parcel of the altar, that is, not extraneous additions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt overlay it with brass</span>.
