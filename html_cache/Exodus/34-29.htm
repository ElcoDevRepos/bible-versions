According to some commentators, a radiance like that here described was a part of man's original heritage, a feature of that "image of God" wherein he was created (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm" title="So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.">Genesis 1:27</a>). The gift was forfeited by the fall, and will not be restored generally until the time of the restitution of all things.

A glory of the kind, but of surpassing brilliancy, belonged to the human nature of our blessed Lord, who concealed it ordinarily, but allowed it to appear temporarily at the transfiguration, and permanently after His ascension (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm" title="And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:">Revelation 10:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>).
