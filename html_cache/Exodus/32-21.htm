This phrase highlights Moses' leadership and responsibility for the Israelites. The question implies a search for accountability and understanding of the events that led to the sin of idolatry. It reflects the gravity of the situation, as Moses seeks to understand the influence the people had on Aaron. This moment is pivotal, as it underscores the tension between leadership and the influence of the masses. The phrase also echoes the biblical theme of leaders being held accountable for their actions and decisions, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>, where Saul blames the people for his disobedience.<p><b>Moses asked Aaron,</b><br>Moses directly addresses Aaron, his brother and the appointed high priest, emphasizing the familial and leadership dynamics at play. Aaron's role is significant, as he was left in charge during Moses' absence. This interaction is a moment of confrontation and accountability. Aaron's response will reveal his character and leadership under pressure. The relationship between Moses and Aaron is complex, marked by cooperation and tension, as seen throughout the Exodus narrative. This moment foreshadows future challenges in their leadership, such as in <a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12</a>, where Aaron and Miriam oppose Moses.<p><b>&#8220;that you have led them into so great a sin?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "so great a sin" refers to the creation and worship of the golden calf, an act of idolatry that violated the first two commandments given by God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This sin is significant because it represents a breach of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The use of "led them" suggests Aaron's active role in facilitating this sin, highlighting the responsibility of leaders to guide their people in righteousness. This incident serves as a warning about the dangers of yielding to popular pressure and the consequences of idolatry. It also prefigures the need for a perfect mediator, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who intercedes for humanity and leads them away from sin (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt.

How had he acquitted himself of this charge? He had allowed the people to commit a great sin. What excuse could he offer for his conduct? Had the people injured him in any way? The question is asked ironically.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24.</span> - AARON TRIES TO EXCUSE HIMSELF. Having taken the needful steps for the destruction of the idol, Moses naturally turned upon Aaron. He had been left in charge of the people, to guide them, instruct them, counsel them in difficulties (<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>). How had he acquitted himself of his task? He had led the people into a great sin - had at any rate connived at it - assisted in it. Moses therefore asks, "What had the people done to him, that he should so act? How had they injured him, that he should so greatly injure them?" To this he has no direct reply. But he will not acknowledge himself in fault - he must excuse himself. And his excuse is twofold: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It was the people's fault, not his; they were "set on mischief." <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It was a fatality - he threw the gold into the fire, and "it came out this calf." We are not surprised, after this, to read in Deuteronomy, that "the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him," and was only hindered from his purpose by the intercession of Moses <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What did this people unto thee?</span> Moses does not suppose that the people had really done anything to Aaron. He asks the question as a reproach - they had done nothing to thee - <span class="accented">had</span> in no way injured thee - and yet thou broughtest this evil upon them. <span class="cmt_word">So great a sin</span>. Literally, "a great sin" - the sin of idolatry. If Aaron had offered a strenuous opposition from the first, the idolatry might not have taken place - the people might have been brought to a better mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/32-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(meh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
