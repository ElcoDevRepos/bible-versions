In the same way, God&#8217;s Word is exact and reliable (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>), leaving no &#8220;gaps&#8221; in truth or promise.<p>- The orderly width anticipates the orderliness God desires in worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the curtains were the same size</b><p>- Uniformity promoted seamless joining, reflecting the unity of God&#8217;s people. <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a> affirms, &#8220;There is one body and one Spirit&#8230; one hope&#8230; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all.&#8221;<p>- Consistency also shows God&#8217;s impartiality&#8212;every curtain received identical honor and function (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p>- Standard size guaranteed that the glory within would not be diminished by human innovation; God&#8212;not man&#8212;set the measurements (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/36-9.htm">Exodus 36:9</a> records precise dimensions because every detail of the Tabernacle foreshadows greater spiritual realities.
