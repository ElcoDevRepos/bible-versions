Their actions demonstrate a reverence for God's moral law over human edicts, aligning with the biblical principle found in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, "We must obey God rather than men." The midwives' faithfulness is rewarded by God, illustrating His justice and mercy. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of God supporting those who act righteously, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>, "The wicked earns deceptive wages, but the one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward."<p><b>and the people multiplied</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants into a great nation. Despite the oppression and harsh conditions imposed by the Egyptians, the Israelites continued to grow in number, demonstrating God's sovereign power and faithfulness to His covenant. This multiplication of the Israelites is a testament to God's providence and His ability to bring about His purposes even in adverse circumstances.<p><b>and became even more numerous</b><br>The increasing number of Israelites despite Pharaoh's attempts to suppress them highlights the futility of opposing God's plans. This mirrors the promise in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, where God tells Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars. The growth of the Israelite population sets the stage for the Exodus, where God will deliver His people from bondage, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. This phrase also reflects the biblical theme of God using the weak and oppressed to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, "But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign and compassionate deity who rewards the faithfulness of the midwives.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midwives.htm">Midwives</a></b><br>Specifically, Shiphrah and Puah, who feared God and defied Pharaoh's orders to kill Hebrew male infants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_people.htm">Hebrew People</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were living in Egypt and experiencing rapid population growth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The king of Egypt who felt threatened by the growing number of Israelites and ordered the killing of newborn Hebrew boys.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were living in bondage, yet experiencing God's blessing through population growth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_god_over_fear_of_man.htm">Fear of God Over Fear of Man</a></b><br>The midwives' actions teach us the importance of fearing God above all earthly authorities.
