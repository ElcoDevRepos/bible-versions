Her willingness to act upon the suggestion of Moses' sister reflects a divine orchestration in the preservation of Moses' life. This moment signifies God's providence and intervention in the lives of His chosen people. The phrase "Go ahead" indicates her immediate acceptance and trust, which is significant given the cultural and political tensions between Egyptians and Hebrews.<p><b>Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter told her.</b><br>Pharaoh's daughter is a pivotal character in the narrative of Moses' early life. Her actions are instrumental in the survival of Moses, who would later become the deliverer of Israel. Historically, Egyptian princesses were influential, and her decision to adopt a Hebrew child highlights a break from her cultural norms. This act of defiance against her father's decree to kill Hebrew male infants (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) underscores a theme of divine protection and the subversion of human plans by God's will.<p><b>And the girl went</b><br>The girl, Moses' sister Miriam, plays a crucial role in the unfolding of God's plan. Her courage and quick thinking are evident as she approaches Pharaoh's daughter and suggests finding a Hebrew nurse for the baby.

This arrangement allows Moses to be raised with an understanding of his Hebrew heritage, which is crucial for his future role as leader and lawgiver. Theologically, this reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant people, ensuring that Moses is nurtured in the faith and traditions of his ancestors.
