In ancient Israel, a "house" represented not just a physical dwelling but the entire household and estate. The prohibition against coveting highlights the spiritual principle that sin begins in the heart. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, where He expands on the idea that sin is not just in actions but in thoughts and desires. The concept of coveting is also linked to the fall of man in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where Eve's desire for the forbidden fruit led to disobedience.<p><b>You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s wife,</b><br>This phrase underscores the sanctity of marriage and the importance of respecting the marital bond. In the cultural context of the time, women were often seen as part of a man's household, yet this commandment elevates the moral responsibility to honor and respect the marital relationship. The prohibition against coveting a neighbor's wife is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the seriousness of lustful thoughts in <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>. This commandment serves as a safeguard for the family unit, which is a foundational element of society.<p><b>or his manservant or maidservant,</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants were considered part of a household's wealth and status. This commandment reflects the broader biblical principle of respecting the dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their social status. The inclusion of servants in this commandment indicates that coveting is not limited to material possessions but extends to people and relationships. This aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which emphasizes equality and unity in Christ.<p><b>or his ox or donkey,</b><br>Oxen and donkeys were valuable assets in an agrarian society, essential for farming and transportation. Coveting these animals would indicate a desire for increased wealth and productivity at the expense of another's prosperity. This commandment encourages believers to trust in God's provision and to avoid the destructive nature of envy. The principle of contentment is further reinforced in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a>, where Paul speaks of being content in all circumstances.<p><b>or anything that belongs to your neighbor.</b><br>This final phrase serves as a comprehensive summary, covering all aspects of coveting. It emphasizes the importance of respecting others' property and being content with one's own possessions. The commandment against coveting is a call to cultivate a heart of gratitude and trust in God's provision. It is a reminder of the broader biblical theme of stewardship, where believers are called to manage their resources wisely and generously. This principle is echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>, which warns against the love of money and encourages godliness with contentment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were given the Law to guide their conduct.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, including the commandment against coveting.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>In the context of this commandment, it refers to fellow members of the Israelite community and, by extension, anyone with whom one interacts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ethical standards for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_covetousness.htm">Understanding Covetousness</a></b><br>Covetousness is not merely a desire for what others have but an inordinate and selfish longing that can lead to other sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>The commandment against coveting calls believers to examine their hearts and desires, aligning them with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_as_a_virtue.htm">Contentment as a Virtue</a></b><br>Cultivating contentment is a powerful antidote to covetousness, helping believers find satisfaction in God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/impact_on_relationships.htm">Impact on Relationships</a></b><br>Coveting can damage relationships by fostering envy and resentment; believers are called to love and rejoice with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_focus.htm">Spiritual Focus</a></b><br>Redirecting desires towards spiritual growth and eternal treasures helps believers maintain a godly perspective.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_20_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 20:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_protect_hearts_from_coveting.htm">How can we guard our hearts against coveting as warned in Exodus 20:17?

Rightly understood, the seventh and eighth commandments contain the tenth, which strikes at covetousness and lustful desire. (Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/5-27.htm" title="You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:">Matthew 5:27-28</a>.) But ancient moralists did not usually recognise this; thought, unless carried out into acts, was regarded as "free;" no responsibility was considered to attach to it, and consequently no one felt it needful to control his thoughts or regulate them. It was therefore of importance that the Divine Law should distinctly assert a control over men's thoughts and feelings, since they are the source of all that is evil in word and act; and true godliness consists in bringing "every thought into captivity to Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm" title="Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;">2Corinthians 10:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not covet</span>. Here the Mosaic law takes a step enormously in advance of any other ancient code. Most codes stopped short at the deed; a few went on to words; not one attempted to control thoughts. "Thou shalt not covet" teaches men that there is One who sees the heart; to whose eyes "all things are naked and open;" and who cares far less for the outward act than the inward thought or motive from which the act proceeds. "Thou shalt not covet: lays it down again that we are not mere slaves of our natural desires and passions, but have a controlling power implanted within us, by means of which we can keep down passion, check desire, resist impulse. Man is lord of himself, capable, by the exercise of his free-will, of moulding his feelings, weakening or intensifying his passions, shaping his character. God, who "requires truth in the inward parts," looks that we should in all cases go to the root of the matter, and not be content with restraining ourselves from evil acts and evil words, but eradicate the evil feeling from which the acts and words proceed. <span class="cmt_word">Thy neighbour</span><span class="cmt_word">s house</span>, etc. The "house" is mentioned first as being of primary necessity, and as in some sort containing all the rest. A man does not take a wife until he has a home to bring her to, or engage domestic servants, or buy slaves, except to form part of a household. The other objects mentioned are placed in the order in which they are usually valued.
