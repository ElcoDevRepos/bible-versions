It reflects the ongoing relationship and dialogue between God and Moses, which is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. This communication underscores the authority and divine backing Moses has in confronting Pharaoh.<p><b>Go to Pharaoh</b><br>Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, is a central figure in the Exodus story. His hardened heart and resistance to God's commands set the stage for the plagues. Egypt, at this time, was a powerful and influential civilization, and Pharaoh was considered a god-king, which makes Moses' mission both dangerous and significant. This command to "go" highlights the courage and faith required of Moses.<p><b>and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says</b><br>This phrase establishes the authority of the message. The title "the God of the Hebrews" distinguishes Yahweh from the Egyptian pantheon and asserts His sovereignty over His people. It also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The use of "says" indicates a prophetic declaration, demanding Pharaoh's attention and compliance.<p><b>&#8216;Let My people go</b><br>This demand is central to the Exodus narrative. It is a call for liberation and freedom from slavery, reflecting God's concern for justice and His power to deliver. The phrase "My people" emphasizes God's ownership and protective relationship with the Israelites. This command is repeated throughout the plagues, highlighting its importance and the persistent resistance of Pharaoh.<p><b>so that they may worship Me</b><br>The purpose of the Israelites' release is not merely freedom but to serve and worship God. This reflects the biblical theme that true freedom is found in serving God. Worship here implies a covenantal relationship and obedience to God's commands. It foreshadows the giving of the Law at Sinai and the establishment of Israel as a nation dedicated to God. This phrase also points to the ultimate purpose of redemption, which is to bring people into right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is demonstrating His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with delivering God's message to Pharaoh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against releasing the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hebrews.htm">The Hebrews (Israelites)</a></b><br>God's chosen people, enslaved in Egypt, whom God desires to free for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of bondage and opposition to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control and His plans will prevail, even against the most powerful earthly rulers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_freedom.htm">Purpose of Freedom</a></b><br>Understand that God desires our freedom not just for its own sake, but so that we may worship and serve Him wholeheartedly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Like Moses, we are called to be obedient messengers of God's truth, even in the face of opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Reflect on the dangers of a hardened heart, as seen in Pharaoh, and seek to remain open and responsive to God's voice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_priority.htm">Worship as a Priority</a></b><br>Prioritize worship in our lives, recognizing it as a central reason for our deliverance and relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_1_God_s_power_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 9:1 demonstrate God's authority over Pharaoh and Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_intentions_in_Let_My_people_go.htm">What does "Let My people go" reveal about God's intentions for Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_9_1_s_freedom_today.htm">How can we apply God's demand for freedom in Exodus 9:1 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_9_1_to_Abraham_s_covenant.htm">What connections exist between Exodus 9:1 and God's covenant promises to Abraham?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_1_Trust_God_s_power.htm">How does Exodus 9:1 encourage us to trust God's power in difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_1_God_s_power_over_rulers.htm">What does Exodus 9:1 reveal about God's authority over nations and rulers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_1_Divine_intervention_impact.htm">How does Exodus 9:1 challenge our understanding of divine intervention in human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_harden_Pharaoh_s_heart_5.htm">Why did God harden Pharaoh's heart according to Exodus 9:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_god_plague_egypt's_livestock.htm">Why did God send the livestock plague to Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_exodus_9_6_mention_surviving_livestock.htm">How can Exodus 9:6 say all Egyptian livestock died, yet later verses still refer to surviving livestock? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_evidence_supports_the_ten_plagues.htm">What evidence supports the occurrence of the Ten Plagues?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_moses_confronting_pharaoh.htm">Exodus 5:1: Where is the historical or archaeological evidence of Moses confronting an Egyptian Pharaoh as described?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Exodus 9:1 Mean</div><b>Then the LORD said to Moses</b><p>- The initiative is entirely God&#8217;s.

It was a <span class= "ital">rinderpest,</span> or murrain upon cattle; which, however, unlike most similar disorders, attacked <span class= "ital">the greater number</span> of the domesticated animals--horses, asses, camels, oxen, and sheep. Thus it was "very grievous" (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm" title="Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.">Exodus 9:3</a>). Horses were highly prized by the Egyptians, and were a comparatively recent importation, having been unknown before the time of the seventeenth, or "Shepherd" Dynasty. They were at first used only in war; then by rich men, in peace, to draw their chariots. They had now, however, it would seem, come to be employed also in agriculture. (Note the words "in the field.") Asses were the ordinary beasts of burthen, and abounded in Egypt anciently as indeed they do at the present day. The Egyptian monuments mention cases where a single landowner owned as many as seven or eight hundred of them. Camels are not represented by the Egyptian sculptors, but are mentioned in the inscriptions (Chabas, <span class= "ital">Etudes sur l' Antiquite Historique,</span> pp. 400-413), and must have been employed in the trade between Egypt and the Sinaitic peninsula. Both oxen and sheep were numerous, and constituted a great part of the wealth of individuals. The plague fell upon such animals as were "in the field" at the time--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the open air, and not confined in stables or sheds. It was the Egyptian practice to house a considerable portion of their cattle; but at the probable season of this plague--December or January--the majority would be in the pastures. Thus the Egyptian losses were very heavy, and the king, no doubt, suffered with the rest, for the Egyptian monarchs were large cattle-owners (<a href="/genesis/47-6.htm" title="The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.">Genesis 47:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/47-17.htm" title="And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.">Genesis 47:17</a>), The Pharaoh was, however, less impressed by this plague than by the fourth, and made no sign of submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Excepting in the designation of Jehovah as "the Lord God of the Hebrews," this verse is an almost exact repetition of the first verse of ch. 8.
