This period marks a significant transition from the initial excitement of liberation to the challenges of wilderness life. The second month, Iyar, is a time of testing and reliance on God for provision.<p><b>after they had left the land of Egypt</b><br>The departure from Egypt is a pivotal event in Israelite history, symbolizing liberation from bondage and the beginning of a covenant relationship with God. This exodus is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/136-11.htm">Psalm 136:11-12</a>).

The journey from Elim signifies moving from comfort to the unknown, requiring faith and dependence on God.<p><b>and came to the Desert of Sin</b><br>The Desert of Sin is a geographical region located between Elim and Mount Sinai. The name "Sin" is not related to the English word for wrongdoing but is likely derived from a Semitic root. This wilderness setting is significant as it becomes a place of testing and divine instruction, where God provides manna and quail (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-15</a>).<p><b>which is between Elim and Sinai</b><br>This location situates the Israelites on their way to Mount Sinai, where they will receive the Law and enter into a covenant with God. The journey from Elim to Sinai is symbolic of spiritual progression, moving from initial deliverance to deeper revelation and commitment.

"Sin" was reached exactly one month after the departure from Egypt, yet there had been only five camping-places between Sin and Rameses, and one journey of three days through a wilderness (<a href="/exodus/15-22.htm" title="So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.">Exodus 15:22</a>). Long rests are thus clearly indicated, and probably occurred at Ayun Musa, at Marah, and at Elim. The places named were the head-quarters of the camp on each occasion, but the entire host must have always covered a vast tract, and the flocks and herds must have been driven into all the neighbouring valleys where there was pasture. Wadys Useit, Ethal, and Tayibeh are likely to have been occupied at the same time with Wady Ghurundel.<span class= "bld"><p>All the congregation . . . came unto the</span> <span class= "bld">wilderness of Sin.</span>--"All the congregation" could only be united in certain favourable positions, where there happened to be a large open space. Such an open space is offered by the tract now called El Markha, which extends from north to south a distance of twenty miles, and is from three to four miles wide in its more northern half. To reach this tract, the Israelites must have descended by Wady Useit or Wady Tayibeh to the coast near Ras Abu Zenimeh, and have then continued along the coast until they crossed the twenty-ninth parallel. This line of march is indicated in <a href="/context/numbers/33-10.htm" title="And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.">Numbers 33:10-11</a>, where we are told that "they removed from Elim, <span class= "ital">and encamped by the Red Sea; </span>and they removed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - THE FIRST MURMURING FOR FOOD.

Hence they entered upon "the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai" - a tract identified by some with the coast plain, El Markha, by others with the inland undulating region known at the present day as the Debbet-er-Ramleh It is difficult to decide between these two views.
