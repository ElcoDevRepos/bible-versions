The Red Sea, known for the miraculous parting during the Exodus, marks the southern boundary. The Sea of the Philistines refers to the Mediterranean Sea, indicating the western boundary. This promise reflects God's covenant with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, where similar boundaries are mentioned. The Philistines were a significant presence in the coastal regions, often in conflict with Israel, as seen in the stories of Samson and David. This promise of land signifies God's intention to provide a secure and prosperous homeland for His people.<p><b>and from the desert to the Euphrates</b><br>The desert likely refers to the Negev or the wilderness areas to the south and east of Canaan. The Euphrates River, a major waterway in the ancient Near East, marks the northeastern boundary. This expansive territory was never fully realized by Israel, except perhaps during the reigns of David and Solomon, indicating a future fulfillment. The mention of the Euphrates connects to the Abrahamic covenant, emphasizing God's faithfulness and the vastness of His promise. This boundary also symbolizes the extent of God's provision and protection.<p><b>For I will deliver the inhabitants into your hand</b><br>This phrase assures divine intervention in the conquest of the Promised Land. The inhabitants refer to the Canaanite nations occupying the land. God's promise to deliver them into Israel's hand underscores His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in the conquest narratives, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. It highlights the necessity of reliance on God's power rather than human strength.<p><b>and you will drive them out before you</b><br>This statement implies human responsibility in cooperation with divine action. While God promises to deliver the inhabitants, the Israelites are tasked with driving them out, indicating a partnership between divine sovereignty and human agency. This command also reflects the need for Israel to maintain purity and avoid the idolatrous practices of the Canaanites, as warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>. The driving out of the inhabitants serves as a type of spiritual warfare, foreshadowing the Christian's battle against sin and the need for holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being promised a specific land by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>A significant body of water marking the starting point of the Israelites' journey from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_the_philistines.htm">The Sea of the Philistines</a></b><br>Likely referring to the Mediterranean Sea, marking the western boundary of the promised land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_desert.htm">The Desert</a></b><br>Refers to the wilderness areas, possibly the Negev, marking the southern boundary.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_euphrates_river.htm">The Euphrates River</a></b><br>A major river in the Middle East, marking the northeastern boundary of the promised land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all nations and faithfully fulfills His promises.

These borders are covenantal, not arbitrary&#8212;God pledged them to Abraham centuries earlier, so this promise ties Exodus directly to that earlier oath (compare <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; 17:8).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;establish&#8221; assures Israel that their security depends on God, not on their own diplomacy or military skill (see <a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the Red Sea</b><p>&#8226;

God&#8217;s promise anticipates later conflicts with the Philistines (<a href="/bsb/judges/13.htm">Judges 13-16</a>; <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>), assuring Israel that even formidable coastal powers cannot annul His decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from the desert</b><p>&#8226;

It is impossible, however, to understand this passage in any other way than as an assignment to Israel of the entire tract between the Desert, or "Wilderness of the Wanderings," and the Euphrates on the one hand, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea on the other. "The River" (<span class= "ital">han-nahar</span>) has no other meaning in the Pentateuch than "the Euphrates." And this was exactly the extent to which the dominions of Israel reached under Solomon, as we see from the description in Kings and Chronicles (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm" title="And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.">1Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm" title="For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.">1Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.">2Chronicles 9:26</a>). It had, according to Moses (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>), been already indicated with tolerable precision in the original promise made to Abraham.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines</span>. This passage by itself would be sufficient to confute Dr. Brugsch's notion, that the Yam Suph (or "Red Sea" of our translators) is the Lake Serbonis, which is a part of the Mediterranean or "Sea of the Philistines," and cannot stand in contrast with it. The "Sea of the Philistines" and the "Red Sea" mark the boundaries of the Holy Land East and West, as the "Desert" and the "River" (Euphrates) do its boundaries North and South. That Moses here lays down those wide limits which were only reached 400 years later, in the time of David and Solomon, and were then speedily lost, can surprise no one who believes in the prophetic gift, and regards Moses as one of the greatest of the Prophets. The tract marked out by these limits had been already promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Its possession by Solomon is distinctly recorded in <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>. As Solomon was "a man of peace," we must ascribe the acquisition of this wide empire to David. (Compare <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The river</span> (<span class="accented">han</span>-<span class="accented">nahar</span>) is in the Pentateuch always the Euphrates. The Nile is <span class="accented">ha-y' or</span>. A powerful kingdom established in Syria is almost sure to extend its influence to the Euphrates. <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand</span>. Compare <a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>, for the first fulfilment of this prophecy. Its complete fulfilment was reserved for the time of David. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt drive them out</span>. The mass of the Canaanites were no doubt "driven out" rather than exterminated. They retired northwards, and gave strength to the great Hittite kingdom which was for many centuries a formidable antagomst of the Egyptian and Assyrian empties. <p> CHAPTER 23:32-33 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/23-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will fix</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
