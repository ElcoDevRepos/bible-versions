In ancient Near Eastern culture, the presence of the owner implies a level of responsibility and oversight. The owner being present suggests that they had the opportunity to prevent or mitigate the loss, thus altering the liability of the borrower. This principle reflects the broader biblical theme of personal responsibility and stewardship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given dominion and responsibility over creation.<p><b>no restitution is required</b><br>The absence of required restitution when the owner is present underscores the principle of shared risk and responsibility. In the context of the Mosaic Law, this reflects a fair and just legal system that considers the circumstances of each case. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical theme of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>, which emphasizes the pursuit of justice. It also highlights the importance of community and mutual trust, as the owner and borrower are expected to have a relationship based on trust and understanding.<p><b>If the animal was rented</b><br>Renting animals was a common practice in ancient agrarian societies, where livestock was essential for farming and transportation. This phrase indicates a formal agreement between the owner and the renter, which would have been understood within the cultural and economic context of the time. The concept of renting aligns with the biblical principle of stewardship, where resources are managed and utilized responsibly, as seen in the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>.<p><b>the fee covers the loss</b><br>This phrase implies that the rental fee includes a provision for potential loss or damage, reflecting a practical approach to risk management. In the ancient world, such agreements would have been based on mutual understanding and fairness, ensuring that both parties are protected. This principle is consistent with the biblical theme of fairness in economic transactions, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, which prohibits defrauding or robbing one's neighbor. It also reflects the broader biblical principle of restitution and compensation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-4</a>, where specific guidelines are given for restoring what has been lost or stolen.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>The individual who seduces the virgin.

When the owner stands beside his animal, he willingly shares in the normal risks of its use.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/22-14.htm">Exodus 22:14</a> makes the contrast clear: &#8220;If a man borrows an animal&#8230; and the owner is not present, he must make full restitution.&#8221; Presence of the owner shifts responsibility away from the borrower.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently ties accountability to authority. When the one with ultimate authority over the property (the owner) is on hand, he exercises oversight (compare <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14</a> &#8211; 30, where the master delegates but still oversees).<p>&#8226; This principle guards against unjust blame. It also models fairness reflected in <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, &#8220;Do not pervert justice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practically, it encourages neighbors to help one another without fear of crushing liability, fostering the community love commanded in <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the animal was rented, the fee covers the loss</b><p>&#8220; If the animal was hired, the hire covers the loss &#8221; (<a href="/exodus/22-15.htm">Exodus 22:15</a>b).<p>&#8226; Renting moves the arrangement from favor to contract. The agreed-upon fee includes not only use but risk.<p>&#8226; By paying the hire, the renter has already supplied compensation; no further settlement is demanded.<p>&#8226; This mirrors wage principles: &#8220;Pay him his wages on the same day&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>). The payment satisfies the obligation.<p>&#8226; The passage honors honest business dealings, echoing <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, &#8220;Dishonest scales are an abomination&#8230; but a just weight is His delight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It also anticipates Jesus&#8217; story of the Good Samaritan, who left &#8220;two denarii and said&#8230; &#8216;Whatever more you spend, I will repay&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-35.htm">Luke 10:35</a>). Clear terms prevent disputes and protect relationships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/22-15.htm">Exodus 22:15</a> teaches that liability hinges on the nature of the agreement. If the owner is present, he accepts the inherent danger, so the borrower is released from repayment. If the animal is formally rented, the rental price itself settles any future loss. God&#8217;s law upholds responsibility, fairness, and neighborly kindness, balancing protection of property with encouragement of generosity and honest commerce.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">If it be a hired thing.</span>--Letting out for hire is akin to lending; but still quite a different transaction.
