This connection emphasizes the unity and diversity within the nation of Israel. The stones symbolize the tribes' unique identities and their collective role as God's chosen people. The use of stones, each distinct in color and type, reflects the individuality of each tribe while being part of a unified whole. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as living stones being built into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><b>Each stone was engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.</b><br>The engraving of each stone "like a seal" signifies permanence and authority. In ancient times, seals were used to authenticate documents and signify ownership or identity. This engraving indicates that each tribe is permanently inscribed in God's covenant and remembered before Him. The high priest, wearing the breastplate, symbolically carried the tribes into God's presence, interceding on their behalf. This foreshadows Christ, our High Priest, who intercedes for believers before the Father (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The permanence of the engraving also points to the eternal nature of God's promises to Israel, as seen in His covenantal faithfulness throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_israel.htm">The Sons of Israel</a></b><br>These are the twelve sons of Jacob, whose descendants became the twelve tribes of Israel.
