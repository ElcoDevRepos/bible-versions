The hardening of hearts is a recurring theme in Exodus, emphasizing God's power and purpose. It reflects the divine judgment against Egypt, as Pharaoh's heart was previously hardened (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>). This hardening serves to fulfill God's plan and demonstrate His supremacy over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh, who was considered a deity himself.<p><b>so that they will go in after them.</b><br>The Egyptians pursuing the Israelites into the Red Sea is a pivotal moment in the Exodus story. This pursuit highlights the desperation and determination of the Egyptians to reclaim their slaves, despite the plagues and signs they had witnessed. The geographical setting of the Red Sea crossing is debated, but it is traditionally understood as a miraculous event where God intervened to deliver His people. The pursuit into the sea sets the stage for the dramatic deliverance of Israel and the destruction of the Egyptian forces.<p><b>Then I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh</b><br>God's intention to gain honor through Pharaoh underscores the theme of divine glory and vindication. In the ancient Near Eastern context, honor and reputation were of utmost importance. By orchestrating events to display His power over Pharaoh, God asserts His authority and demonstrates that He alone is worthy of worship. This act serves as a testament to God's faithfulness to His covenant with Israel and His ability to save His people.<p><b>and all his army and chariots and horsemen.</b><br>The mention of Pharaoh's army, chariots, and horsemen highlights the military might of Egypt, which was one of the most powerful nations of the time. Chariots were a symbol of strength and technological advancement in warfare. The destruction of this formidable force serves as a powerful demonstration of God's superiority over human power and military prowess. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over all earthly powers, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the triumph of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who declares His intention to harden the hearts of the Egyptians to demonstrate His power and glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened by God, leading him to pursue the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, specifically the army, who are led by Pharaoh to chase after the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are being pursued by the Egyptians as they flee from slavery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites are crossing, which becomes the setting for God's miraculous deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, even the hardening of hearts, to fulfill His purposes and display His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_glory.htm">Divine Glory</a></b><br>Understand that God's actions, even those that seem harsh, are ultimately for His glory and the good of His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_deliverance.htm">Faith in Deliverance</a></b><br>Trust in God's power to deliver us from seemingly impossible situations, just as He delivered the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience.htm">The Role of Obedience</a></b><br>Reflect on the importance of obedience to God's commands, as the Israelites had to trust and follow Moses' leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_nations.htm">Witness to the Nations</a></b><br>Consider how God's mighty acts in our lives can serve as a testimony to others, drawing them to recognize His power and glory.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_14_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 14:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_14_17_God_s_power_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 14:17 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Pharaoh and his army?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Divine_judgment_in_Exodus_14_17.htm">What does God's hardening of hearts in Exodus 14:17 teach about divine judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_s_plan_amid_challenges.htm">How can we trust God's plan when facing seemingly insurmountable challenges today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Exodus_14_17_prefigure_Christ.htm">In what ways does Exodus 14:17 foreshadow Christ's victory over sin and death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Exodus_14_17_s_lesson.htm">How can believers apply the lesson of God's deliverance in Exodus 14:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_14_17_God_s_control_over_all.htm">How does Exodus 14:17 demonstrate God's sovereignty over nature and human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_14_17_Archaeological_evidence.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the events described in Exodus 14:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_14_17_Why_harden_Pharaoh_s_heart.htm">How does Exodus 14:17 reflect God's purpose in hardening Pharaoh's heart?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/if_god_hardened_pharaoh's_heart,_why_blame_him.htm">If Exodus 14:17 says God hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, how can Pharaoh be held responsible for his actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_humble_yourself_before_god.htm">What is the summary of the Exodus from Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_there_evidence_for_the_red_sea_parting.htm">Psalm 136:13-15 describes parting the Red Sea;

Here, and here only, are the hearts of the Egyptians generally said to have been "hardened." Whatever meaning we attach to the expression, there will be no more difficulty in applying it to them than to Pharaoh. They had made themselves partakers in the monarch's guilt by mustering in hot haste when he summoned them, and had allowed themselves to revel in the anticipation of plunder and carnage (<a href="/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>). Under such circumstances, the general laws which govern human nature would be quite sufficient to make their hearts grow hard. <span class="cmt_word">They shall follow them</span>. Upon this act - rash, if the phenomenon had been a mere natural one - presumptuous and infatuated if the drying up were regarded as miraculous - depended altogether the destruction of the Egyptians. They had only to have "stood still" and allowed the escape, which a week previously they had done their best to encourage, in order to have remained safe and unhurt. It was their stupidity and blood-thirstiness which alone brought them into any danger. <span class="cmt_word">Upon his horsemen</span>. Rather "his chariotmen."
