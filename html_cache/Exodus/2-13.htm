His decision to go out among the Hebrews indicates a growing identification with his people. This event occurs after Moses had killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew, showing his protective instincts towards his people. The Hebrews were enslaved in Egypt, and tensions among them could have been high due to their harsh conditions. This scene foreshadows Moses' future role as a leader and mediator for the Israelites.<p><b>He asked the one in the wrong,</b><br>Moses' intervention highlights his sense of justice and responsibility. The phrase "the one in the wrong" suggests that Moses could discern right from wrong, a quality necessary for his future leadership. This moment reflects the biblical principle of addressing sin and wrongdoing within the community, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where believers are instructed to confront a brother who sins.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you attacking your companion?&#8221;</b><br>Moses' question underscores the importance of unity among the Hebrews. The term "companion" emphasizes the shared identity and brotherhood among the Israelites, which is crucial for their survival and eventual exodus. This appeal for peace and reconciliation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live in harmony and love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).
