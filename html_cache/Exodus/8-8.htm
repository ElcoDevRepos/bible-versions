His summoning of Moses and Aaron indicates a moment of desperation, as the plagues have begun to affect him personally. This act of summoning is significant as it shows a temporary acknowledgment of the power of the God of Israel, whom Pharaoh previously dismissed. Moses and Aaron, as God's chosen leaders, are consistently portrayed as intermediaries between God and Pharaoh, highlighting their roles as prophets and leaders.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Pray to the LORD</b><br>Pharaoh's request for prayer to the LORD (Yahweh) is notable because it shows a recognition, albeit reluctant, of the God of Israel. This is a moment where Pharaoh, who considered himself a god, acknowledges a higher power. The act of asking for prayer suggests a momentary humility and a recognition of the limitations of his own gods and magicians, who were unable to replicate or reverse the plague.<p><b>to take the frogs away from me and my people.</b><br>The plague of frogs was the second of ten plagues and was a direct challenge to the Egyptian goddess Heqet, who was depicted as a frog and associated with fertility and childbirth. The infestation of frogs was not only a nuisance but also a religious affront, as frogs were considered sacred and not to be killed. Pharaoh's plea to have the frogs removed underscores the severity of the plague and its impact on daily life and religious practices in Egypt.<p><b>Then I will let your people go,</b><br>Pharaoh's promise to let the Israelites go is a recurring theme throughout the plagues. It reflects a pattern of temporary repentance and negotiation, which Pharaoh repeatedly fails to uphold. This promise is significant as it touches on the central conflict of the Exodus narrative: the liberation of the Israelites from slavery. It also foreshadows the eventual fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people.<p><b>that they may sacrifice to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The request for the Israelites to sacrifice to the LORD highlights the importance of worship and obedience to God. Sacrifice was a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement, thanksgiving, and dedication to God. This phrase underscores the purpose of the Exodus: not just physical liberation, but spiritual freedom to serve and worship the true God. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides the means for humanity's reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is resistant to letting the Israelites go, despite the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and spokesperson, who assists Moses in confronting Pharaoh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is demonstrating His power over Egypt through the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_frogs.htm">The Plague of Frogs</a></b><br>The second plague sent by God upon Egypt, covering the land with frogs as a sign of His power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's request for relief without true repentance highlights the danger of a hardened heart.

(See the comment on <a href="/exodus/7-23.htm" title="And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.">Exodus 7:23</a>.) But he suffered from the frogs as much as any one else (<a href="/context/exodus/8-3.htm" title="And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:">Exodus 8:3-4</a>); and the personal inconvenience drove him to make a concession. As far as words could go, the concession was complete. (1) He acknowledged the power of Jehovah ("Intreat the Lord, that <span class= "ital">He</span> may take away, &c."'); (2) he acknowledged the power of righteous men's prayers; (3) he made an absolute unreserved promise to "let the people go."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-15.</span> - How long the plague of frogs endured, we are not told. Probably every effort was made, short of intentionally killing them, to get rid of them. Snakes, and chameleons, and ibises would destroy many - others would be crushed beneath wheels, trampled on by animals, squeezed to death by the opening of doors, unintentionally killed by men. But the vacancies made were constantly filled; and there seemed no prospect of the infliction passing away. The influence of his counsellors would under these circumstances be brought to bear upon the mind of the Pharaoh - he would be warned that his subjects were attributing their sufferings to his obstinacy - he would be recommended - perhaps pressed - to yield, and would find in the annoyance which he individually endured a strong motive for compliance. Accordingly, he after a while sent for the two Israelite chiefs, and made the request recorded in the text. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Intreat the Lord</span> - <span class="accented">i.e</span>., "Intreat your God, Jehovah, who has sent this plague, and can doubtless take it away." An acknowledgment of Jehovah's power is now for the first time forced from the reluctant king, who has hitherto boasted that "he knew not Jehovah" (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will let the people go</span>. The royal word is passed. A positive promise is made.
