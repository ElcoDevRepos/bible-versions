This hierarchical structure reflects the oppressive system in place, where the Israelites were subjected to harsh labor. The taskmasters' role is reminiscent of the oppressive systems seen throughout history, where a ruling class enforces its will on subjugated peoples. This situation sets the stage for the increasing tension between Pharaoh and the Israelites, as Moses and Aaron demand their release.<p><b>&#8220;This is what Pharaoh says:</b><br>Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, is depicted as a figure of absolute authority, whose word is law. In the biblical narrative, Pharaoh often represents the archetype of worldly power and opposition to God's will. This phrase echoes the authoritative declarations found throughout the Bible, where leaders speak on behalf of their nations or deities. The phrase "This is what Pharaoh says" contrasts with the prophetic declarations of "Thus says the Lord," highlighting the conflict between divine authority and human authority.<p><b>&#8216;I am no longer giving you straw.</b><br>Straw was a crucial component in the production of bricks, which the Israelites were forced to make as part of their labor. By withholding straw, Pharaoh increases the burden on the Israelites, as they must now gather their own materials while maintaining their production quota. This act of cruelty is indicative of Pharaoh's hardened heart and his refusal to acknowledge the God of Israel. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith for the Israelites, as they are pushed to their limits. The withholding of straw can also be viewed as a metaphor for the spiritual burdens that people face when they are oppressed by sin and worldly powers, drawing a parallel to the liberation that comes through faith in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the oppressive force against the Israelites.

Egyptian taskmasters and Hebrew foremen step out with orders that expose Pharaoh&#8217;s counterfeit authority, deepen Israel&#8217;s misery, and set the stage for God to display His superior power. In one verse we see the clash of kingdoms: human rule tightening its grip, and divine deliverance already on the horizon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - The command of Pharaoh gone forth - no straw was to be provided for the Israelites, they were themselves to gather straw. The taskmasters could not soften the edict; they could only promulgate it (vers. 10, 11). And the Israelites could only choose between rebelling and endeavouring to obey. To rebel seemed hopeless; Moses and Aaron did not advise rebellion, and so the attempt was made to carry out Pharaoh's behest (ver. 12). But experience proved that obedience to it was impossible. Though the people did their best, and the native officers set over them did their best, and the Egyptian taskmasters hurried them on as much as possible (ver. 13), the result was that the tale of bricks fell short. Then, according to a barbarous practice said to be even now not unknown in Egypt (Kalisch), the native officers who Had not delivered in the appointed "tale of bricks" were bastinadoed, suffering agonies for no fault of their own (ver. 16), but because the people Had been set an impossible task. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The taskmasters... went out</span>, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. quitted the royal palace to which they Had been summoned (ver. 6), and proceeded to the places where the people worked.
