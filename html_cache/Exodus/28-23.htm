The use of gold in the construction of the priestly garments signifies the sacredness and the divine nature of the priestly office. Gold was a common material in the tabernacle and temple, representing the glory and holiness of God. The rings were functional, serving as connectors, but their material also highlighted the importance of the breastpiece.<p><b>and fasten them to the two corners of the breastpiece.</b><br>The breastpiece, also known as the breastplate of judgment, was an essential part of the high priest's attire. It was worn over the ephod and contained the Urim and Thummim, used for divine decision-making. The fastening of the rings to the corners ensured that the breastpiece was securely attached, symbolizing the high priest's role in bearing the judgment and decisions of the people before God. The breastpiece's design and function point to the mediatory role of the high priest, which is a type of Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who intercedes on our behalf.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who was appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

They describe very minutely, and with some tautology, the mode in which the breast-plate was to be fastened to the ephod. It was to have four rings, two at its two upper corners (ver. 23), and two just behind its two lower corners (ver. 20); a gold twist or cord was to be passed through each of the two upper rings, and then attached to the" ouches" or settings of the shoulder stones (ver. 25; compare vers. 11-14). A blue lace or ribbon was to be passed through each of the two lower rings, and these laces were to be tied to two rings, sewn for the purpose on to the front of the ephod a little above the "curious girdle" (vers. 26, 27). By these four fastenings at its four corners, the breast-plate was securely attached to the ephod, and could not readily get loose from it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/28-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
