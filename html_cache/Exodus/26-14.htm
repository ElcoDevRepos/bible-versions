The "tent" here is the Tabernacle itself, which served as the dwelling place of God among His people. The covering was essential for protection and symbolized God's presence and protection over Israel. The Tabernacle was central to Israelite worship and was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem.<p><b>out of ram skins dyed red</b><br>Ram skins were chosen for their durability and availability. The dyeing of these skins red is significant, as red often symbolizes sacrifice and atonement in the Bible. Rams were commonly used in sacrificial offerings, and the red color could symbolize the blood of sacrifices, pointing to the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who would atone for the sins of humanity. This covering would remind the Israelites of the need for atonement and the seriousness of sin.<p><b>and over that a covering of fine leather</b><br>The "fine leather" mentioned here is sometimes translated as "sea cow hides" or "badger skins" in other versions, indicating a material that was both durable and weather-resistant. This outermost covering provided additional protection from the elements, ensuring the Tabernacle's sanctity and longevity. The use of fine materials reflects the importance of the Tabernacle as a holy place. This layer can also symbolize the righteousness and protection provided by God, as well as the beauty and majesty of His dwelling place. The multiple layers of coverings highlight the separation between the holy presence of God and the outside world, emphasizing the need for purity and reverence in approaching God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were instructed to build the Tabernacle as a place of worship during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/ram_skins_dyed_red.htm">Ram Skins Dyed Red</a></b><br>A specific material used for the outer covering of the Tabernacle, symbolizing sacrifice and atonement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fine_leather.htm">Fine Leather</a></b><br>The outermost covering of the Tabernacle, providing protection and durability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The ram skins dyed red remind us of the sacrificial system and ultimately point to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_detailed_instructions.htm">God's Detailed Instructions</a></b><br>The specific materials and design of the Tabernacle highlight the importance of obedience to God's instructions in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_and_provision.htm">Protection and Provision</a></b><br>The fine leather covering signifies God's provision and protection over His people, encouraging us to trust in His care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/temporary_dwelling.htm">Temporary Dwelling</a></b><br>The Tabernacle was a temporary structure, reminding us that our earthly life is temporary and we should focus on eternal matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_fulfillment.htm">Christ as the Fulfillment</a></b><br>The Tabernacle foreshadows Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God with humanity, offering us direct access to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_26_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 26:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_26_14_God_s_detail_in_worship.htm">How does Exodus 26:14 demonstrate God's attention to detail in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Tabernacle_role_of_ram_skins_leather.htm">What significance do the "ram skins" and "fine leather" hold for the Tabernacle?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_excellence_in_worship.htm">How can we apply the principle of excellence in worship from Exodus 26:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_26_14_and_God_s_holiness_link.htm">How does Exodus 26:14 connect to the broader theme of God's holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_26_14_s_worship_lessons_today.htm">What lessons from Exodus 26:14 can guide our church's worship practices today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_two_coverings_in_Exodus_26_14.htm">Why does Exodus 26:14 specify two coverings for the tabernacle?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_ram_skins_fine_leather_in_Ex_26_14.htm">What is the significance of using ram skins and fine leather in Exodus 26:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_26_14_Worship_materials_role.htm">How do the materials in Exodus 26:14 reflect God's instructions for worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_26.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/exodus_26_14_-_proof_of_ram_sea_cow_skins.htm">Exodus 26:14 - What evidence exists that these exact layers of ram skins and sea cow hides (or 'porpoise skins') ever existed as described?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/honor_parents_or_not_(ex._20_12_vs._lk._14_26).htm">Should we honor our parents?
