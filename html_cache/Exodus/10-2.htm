In the ancient Near Eastern culture, oral tradition was a primary means of preserving history and religious teachings. This command underscores the responsibility of the Israelites to educate their descendants about God's power and faithfulness. It aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, which instructs parents to diligently teach their children about God's commandments.<p><b>how severely I dealt with the Egyptians</b><br>This refers to the plagues that God sent upon Egypt, demonstrating His power and judgment. The severity of the plagues was a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh's authority. Historically, Egypt was a dominant power, and the plagues served to dismantle their perceived invincibility. This phrase highlights God's justice and His ability to humble the proud, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<p><b>when I performed miraculous signs among them</b><br>The miraculous signs, or plagues, were not only acts of judgment but also served as signs of God's sovereignty and power. Each plague targeted specific aspects of Egyptian life and their deities, revealing the impotence of the Egyptian gods. These signs were meant to demonstrate that the God of Israel was the one true God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, where God declares that the Egyptians will know He is the LORD.<p><b>so that all of you may know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the ultimate purpose of the plagues: to reveal God's identity and authority. The knowledge of God as LORD is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This revelation is not only for the Israelites but also for the Egyptians and the surrounding nations. It foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who performed signs and miracles to reveal His divine nature, as seen in <a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
