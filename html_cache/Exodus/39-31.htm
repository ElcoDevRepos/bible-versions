Blue, often associated with the heavens, symbolizes divinity and the presence of God. In the tabernacle, blue was a prominent color, representing the heavenly origin of the law and the divine nature of the priesthood. The blue cord here connects the priestly garments to their divine purpose and origin, emphasizing the holiness required in approaching God.<p><b>to mount it on the turban</b><br>The turban, or "mitre," was part of the high priest's attire, signifying his role and authority. The mounting of the blue cord on the turban indicates the importance of the high priest's role as a mediator between God and the people. The turban itself was a symbol of purity and dedication, and the addition of the blue cord further highlights the divine calling and responsibility of the high priest. This act of mounting signifies the readiness and consecration of the priest for service.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions. Throughout the construction of the tabernacle and the making of the priestly garments, there is a repeated emphasis on following God's commands precisely. This obedience reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon adherence to His laws. It also foreshadows the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law completely. The meticulous following of God's commands by Moses and the Israelites serves as a model for faithfulness and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and receive the Law on Mount Sinai.
