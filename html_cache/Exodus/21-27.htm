The loss of a tooth, though seemingly minor, symbolizes a significant injury in this context. The law emphasizes the value and dignity of the servant, acknowledging their rights and protection under the law. This reflects the principle of justice and fairness, ensuring that even those in servitude are not subjected to undue harm. The cultural context of the time often saw servants as property, yet this law elevates their status by providing them with specific rights.<p><b>he must let the servant go free</b><br>The requirement to release the servant underscores the principle of restitution and justice. This provision serves as a deterrent against mistreatment, ensuring that masters are held accountable for their actions. The freedom granted to the servant is a form of compensation, recognizing the personal loss and injury suffered. This reflects the biblical theme of liberation and redemption, which is echoed throughout Scripture, including the ultimate liberation found in Christ.<p><b>as compensation for the tooth</b><br>The concept of compensation here is rooted in the principle of lex talionis, or the law of retaliation, which is also seen in the "eye for an eye" principle. However, rather than exacting physical retribution, the law provides a form of restorative justice. This anticipates the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who emphasizes mercy and forgiveness over strict retribution. The compensation serves as a tangible acknowledgment of the servant's injury and loss, ensuring that justice is served in a manner that restores dignity and balance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Exodus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, forming the covenant community under God's guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>In this context, refers to Hebrew servants who were part of the Israelite community and had specific rights and protections under the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The person who owns the servant and is responsible for their treatment according to the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the laws concerning the treatment of servants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_justice_and_fairness.htm">Principle of Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>The law in <a href="/exodus/21-27.htm">Exodus 21:27</a> emphasizes the importance of justice and fairness in the treatment of others, especially those in vulnerable positions.

Scripture treats even &#8220;minor&#8221; bodily harm seriously (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>, which restricts flogging to preserve dignity).<p>- The verse teaches that bodily integrity matters because people bear God&#8217;s image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). No injury is dismissed as trivial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of his manservant or maidservant</b><p>- Servanthood in Israel was typically debt-based and temporary (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>). Servants were fellow covenant members, not property to be abused.<p>- <a href="/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13&#8211;15</a> shows the same ethic: &#8220;If I have denied justice to my manservant or maidservant&#8230; did not He who made me in the womb make them?&#8221;.<p>- By naming both male and female servants, the law protects everyone equally (cf. <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> for the principle carried forward in Christ).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must let the servant go free</b><p>- Immediate emancipation is required; there is no appeal or delay. This prevents further mistreatment and restores the injured person to full social freedom (<a href="/leviticus/25-41.htm">Leviticus 25:41</a>).<p>- Contrast with pagan laws of the time that only fined owners; here the cost is the loss of labor for the remaining term&#8212;an incentive to treat servants well (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As compensation for the tooth</b><p>- The release functions as restitution (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>, &#8220;he must make restitution&#8221;).<p>- God assigns a value to human dignity higher than monetary payment. Freedom outweighs any wage loss, underscoring &#8220;the worker is worthy of his wages&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>).<p>- This anticipates Christ&#8217;s redemption, where He frees us not with silver or gold but with His own blood (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-27.htm">Exodus 21:27</a> shows God protecting the vulnerable by demanding freedom as payment for even a single lost tooth. Bodily harm, however small, violates the dignity of a fellow image-bearer. Therefore, those in authority must exercise care and compassion, knowing that God defends the oppressed and requires justice that restores both honor and liberty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
