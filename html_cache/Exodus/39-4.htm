The shoulder pieces were significant as they held the onyx stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing the high priest bearing the people before God. This act of bearing the tribes on the shoulders can be seen as a type of Christ, who bears the burdens of His people. The ephod's design reflects the importance of intercession and representation before God, a role fulfilled by Jesus as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>which were attached at two of its corners</b><br>The attachment at the corners indicates a precise and intentional design, ensuring the ephod was secure and functional. This detail underscores the importance of order and structure in worship, reflecting God's nature as a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). The craftsmanship required for such attachments highlights the skill and dedication of the artisans, who were filled with the Spirit of God for this task (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>).<p><b>so it could be fastened</b><br>The fastening of the ephod ensured that it remained in place during the high priest's duties, symbolizing stability and readiness in service to God. This stability can be seen as a metaphor for the steadfastness required in spiritual leadership and service. The concept of being "fastened" or "secured" is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to stand firm in their faith (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>). The ephod's secure fastening also points to the security believers have in Christ, who holds them firmly in His care (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given the task of constructing the Tabernacle and its furnishings according to God's instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its sacred garments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephod.htm">The Ephod</a></b><br>A sacred garment worn by the High Priest, part of the priestly attire, symbolizing the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the instructions for the Tabernacle and the priestly garments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites followed God's specific instructions for the ephod, demonstrating the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_ephod.htm">Symbolism of the Ephod</a></b><br>The ephod represents the priestly role of mediation, pointing to Christ as our ultimate mediator.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_connection.htm">Unity and Connection</a></b><br>The shoulder pieces attached to the ephod symbolize the unity and connection between God and His people, reminding us of our connection to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/craftsmanship_and_skill.htm">Craftsmanship and Skill</a></b><br>The detailed work on the ephod highlights the value of using our God-given skills for His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_role_of_believers.htm">Priestly Role of Believers</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be a royal priesthood, serving God and others with dedication and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_39_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 39:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_39_4_Importance_of_God_s_details.htm">How does Exodus 39:4 demonstrate the importance of following God's detailed instructions?
