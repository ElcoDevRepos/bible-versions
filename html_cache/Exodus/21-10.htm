This phrase acknowledges the reality of polygamous marriages in ancient Israelite society. The law here is not an endorsement of polygamy but a regulation to protect the rights of the first wife. This reflects God's concern for justice and fairness within the family unit. The practice of taking multiple wives can be seen in the lives of patriarchs like Jacob (Genesis 29-30), but it often led to familial strife, as seen in the rivalry between Leah and Rachel.<p><b>he must not reduce the food</b><br>The provision of food is a basic necessity and a husband's responsibility to his wife. This requirement ensures that the first wife's material needs are not neglected in favor of a new wife. The emphasis on food highlights the importance of sustenance and care within the marriage covenant. This principle of providing for one's family is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul writes about the responsibility to care for one's household (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p><b>clothing</b><br>Clothing, like food, is a fundamental need and a symbol of dignity and respect. In ancient times, clothing was often handmade and valuable, representing a significant part of a family's resources. By mandating that the first wife's clothing not be diminished, the law underscores the importance of maintaining her dignity and status within the household. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision and care for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where Jesus speaks about God's provision for our needs.<p><b>or marital rights of his first wife</b><br>Marital rights include not only physical intimacy but also the emotional and relational aspects of marriage. This phrase ensures that the first wife's conjugal rights are not neglected, emphasizing the importance of love and faithfulness in marriage. The protection of these rights reflects the biblical view of marriage as a covenant relationship, as seen in <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>, where marriage is described as a covenant before God. This also points to the New Testament teaching on the mutual responsibilities of husbands and wives (<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>), where love and respect are central to the marital relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Exodus, who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The recipients of the Law, God's chosen people, who were being formed into a nation after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>- The place where God gave the Law to Moses, including the regulations found in <a href="/bsb/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/first_wife.htm">First Wife</a></b><br>- The woman whose rights are being protected by this law, ensuring her well-being despite the introduction of another wife.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/second_wife.htm">Second Wife</a></b><br>- The additional wife mentioned in the context of polygamous relationships, which were culturally accepted at the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_concern_for_justice_and_fairness.htm">God's Concern for Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>The law in <a href="/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a> reflects God's concern for justice and fairness, even within the cultural context of polygamy. It underscores the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_of_the_vulnerable.htm">Protection of the Vulnerable</a></b><br>This verse highlights God's protection for the vulnerable, ensuring that the first wife is not neglected or mistreated. It serves as a reminder to care for those who may be disadvantaged or marginalized.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_covenant.htm">Marriage as a Covenant</a></b><br>The marital rights mentioned in this verse point to the covenantal nature of marriage, where both parties have responsibilities and rights.

The Lord refuses to let her be sidelined (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>).<p>- Even though <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a> reveal God&#8217;s creational pattern of one man and one woman, <a href="/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a> shows His justice meeting people where they were, insisting on covenant faithfulness and dignity for every wife.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must not reduce the food</b><p>- &#8220;Food&#8221; speaks of daily sustenance&#8212;meals, nourishment, the basics that keep a person healthy.<p>&#8226; God had already demonstrated His heart to feed His people (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-18</a>); now He demands the husband mirror that care.<p>&#8226; Neglecting family provision is treated as a serious moral failure (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-27</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p>- The command is proactive: keep the standard of provision the same as before the second marriage. No cutting corners, no rationing to save costs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Clothing</b><p>- Clothing represents protection from the elements, modesty, and social dignity.<p>&#8226; Jacob vowed that God&#8217;s faithfulness included &#8220;clothing to wear&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The virtuous wife&#8217;s household &#8220;is clothed in scarlet&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21</a>), showing abundance, not bare minimum.<p>- The husband must continue supplying garments that fit the season and her status as his wife&#8212;tangible evidence that she is still honored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or marital rights of his first wife</b><p>- &#8220;Marital rights&#8221; encompass sexual intimacy, affection, and the personal attention due within the covenant (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18-19</a>).<p>- By binding this into law, God protects the first wife from emotional abandonment and from being relegated to a servant role.<p>- The husband&#8217;s heart, time, and body are not his alone; they belong covenantally to his wife, and that responsibility does not shrink because he complicates his household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a> sets ironclad limits around a husband&#8217;s freedom: if he takes another wife, he must still provide the same food, the same clothing, and the same conjugal attention to his first wife.
