The Red Sea crossing is a pivotal event, symbolizing salvation and deliverance. This act of leadership is a type of Christ, who leads believers from the bondage of sin to freedom. The Red Sea itself is a geographical marker, possibly the Gulf of Suez or Aqaba, and its crossing is a testament to God's power over nature.<p><b>and they went out into the Desert of Shur</b><br>The Desert of Shur is located in the northwestern part of the Sinai Peninsula. This region is characterized by its arid conditions and sparse vegetation. The journey into the desert signifies a transition from the miraculous to the mundane challenges of life. It reflects the testing of faith, as the Israelites must rely on God for sustenance. The desert experience is a common biblical motif, representing trials and spiritual growth.<p><b>For three days they walked in the desert without finding water</b><br>The number three often signifies completeness or divine intervention in the Bible. The lack of water for three days is a test of faith and endurance, echoing the three days Christ spent in the tomb before His resurrection. This period of thirst foreshadows the Israelites' recurring struggles with trust and obedience. It also highlights the necessity of relying on God for provision, as seen in other biblical narratives where God provides for His people in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

It is uncertain at what exact point of the coast they emerged from the sea-bed, but it can scarcely have been at any great distance from the modern Suez. The "springs of Moses," Ayun Musa, which are about seven miles from Suez, may well have been the halting-place where the "Song" was composed and sung. At this spot there is considerable vegetation, and a number of wells, variously reckoned at seven, seventeen, and nineteen.<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness of Shur </span>is the arid tract extending from Lake Serbonis on the north to Ain Howarah towards the south.

The Israelites traversed only the southern portion, which is an actual desert, treeless, waterless, and, except in the early spring, destitute of herbage. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-27.</span> - THE JOURNEY FROM THE RED SEA TO ELIM. After a stay, which cannot be exactly measured, but which was probably one of some days, near the point of the Eastern coast of the Gulf of Suez, at which they had emerged from the sea-bed, the Israelites, under the guidance of the pillar of the cloud, resumed their journey, and were conducted southwards, or south-eastwards, through the arid tract, called indifferently "the wilderness of Shut" (verse 22), and "the wilderness of Etham" (<a href="/numbers/33-8.htm">Numbers 33:8</a>), to a place called Marah. It is generally supposed that the first halt must have been at Ayun Musa, or "the springs of Moses." This is "the only green spot near the passage over the Red Sea" (Cook). It possesses at present seventeen wells, and is an oasis of grass and tamarisk in the midst of a sandy desert. When Wellsted visited it in 1836, there were abundant palm-trees. It does not lie on the shore, but at the distance of about a mile and a half from the beach, with which it was at one time connected by an aqueduct, built for the convenience of the ships, which here took in their water. The water is regarded as good and wholesome, though dark-coloured and somewhat brackish. From Ayun Musa the Israelites pursued their way in a direction a little east of south through a barren plain where sand-storms are frequent - part of the wilderness of Shur - for three days without finding water. Here their flocks and herds must have suffered greatly, and many of the animals probably died on the journey. On the last of the three days water was found at a spot called thenceforth "Marah," "bitterness," because the liquid was undrinkable. After the miracle related in ver. 25, and an encampment by the side of the sweetened spring (<a href="/numbers/33-8.htm">Numbers 33:8</a>), they proceeded onward without much change of direction to Elim, where was abundance of good water and a grove of seventy palm-trees. Here "they encamped by the waters," and were allowed a rest, which probably exceeded a fortnight (See the comment on Exodus 16:1.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea</span>. There is no such connection between this verse and the preceding narrative as the word "so" expresses.
