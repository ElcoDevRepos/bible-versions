Moses is portrayed as a prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of Moses' mission. It also reflects the intimate relationship between God and Moses, as seen throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>Go to Pharaoh</b><br>The command to "go to Pharaoh" is a continuation of Moses' mission to confront the Egyptian ruler and demand the release of the Israelites. Pharaoh, the title for the king of Egypt, was considered a god by his people, making this confrontation not just a political challenge but a spiritual one. This phrase sets the stage for the ongoing conflict between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt, highlighting the theme of divine sovereignty.<p><b>for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a complex theological concept. It demonstrates God's sovereignty over human will and serves to fulfill His purposes. This hardening is both a divine act and a response to Pharaoh's own stubbornness. The hardening of the officials' hearts indicates that the resistance to God's will is not limited to Pharaoh alone but extends to his entire administration, emphasizing the systemic nature of the opposition to God's plan.<p><b>that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them</b><br>The purpose of the hardening is to allow God to display His power through miraculous signs, which are the plagues. These signs serve multiple purposes: they are judgments against the gods of Egypt, they demonstrate God's supremacy, and they are a means of revealing His power to both the Egyptians and the Israelites. The plagues are also prophetic, foreshadowing future judgments and deliverances, and they typify the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who performs signs and wonders to reveal God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is orchestrating the events to demonstrate His power and sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with confronting Pharaoh and leading the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened by God to fulfill His divine purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and where God is performing signs and wonders to secure their release.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_signs.htm">The Signs</a></b><br>Miraculous events orchestrated by God to demonstrate His power and to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, even the hardening of hearts, to fulfill His divine purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_hardening.htm">Purpose of Hardening</a></b><br>Understand that God may allow resistance to His will to display His power and bring about His greater plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_obedience.htm">Role of Obedience</a></b><br>Like Moses, we are called to obey God's commands, even when facing opposition or seemingly insurmountable challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Reflect on how God uses miraculous events to reveal His character and intentions to both believers and non-believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_adversity.htm">Faith in Adversity</a></b><br>Trust in God's plan and timing, even when circumstances seem difficult or when facing hardened hearts.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_10_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 10:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_10_1_God_s_control_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 10:1 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Pharaoh's heart and actions?

The nature of the visitation is uncontested and incontestable--it was a terrible invasion of locusts. Locusts are an occasional, though not a frequent, scourge in Egypt. They are not bred there, and necessarily arrive from some foreign country. When they descend, their ravages are as severe as elsewhere. "In the present day," says Mr. Stuart Poole, "locusts suddenly appear in the cultivated land, coming from the desert in a column of great length. They fly across the country, darkening the air with their compact ranks, which are undisturbed by the constant attacks of kites, crows, and vultures, and making a strange whizzing sound, like that of fire, or many distant wheels. Where they alight they devour every green thing, even stripping the trees of their leaves. Rewards are offered for their destruction; but no labour can seriously reduce their numbers" (<span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible,</span> vol. ii., p. 887). C. Niebuhr witnessed two invasions--in 1761 and 1762; Denon witnessed another about the year 1800; and Tischendorf saw one recently. They always enter Egypt either from the south or from the east, and necessarily come with a wind, since they cannot possibly fly any considerable distance without one. It is probable that at different times different varieties of the locust visit the country; but all varieties are almost equally destructive. After the loss of their cattle by murrain and hail, and the ruin of the flax and barley crops by the latter agency, nothing was wanting to complete the desolation of the country and the impoverishment of its inhabitants but the ruin of the wheat and <span class= "ital">doora</span> crops, which the locusts speedily effected.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">I have hardened . . . the heart of his servants.</span>--They, too, had first hardened their own hearts (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>), and so deserved a penal hardening. A certain amount of responsibility rested on <span class= "ital">them.</span> Had they allowed the miracles to have their full natural effect upon their minds, they would have been convinced that resistance was useless, and would have impressed their views upon the Pharaoh. Even in the most absolute governments public opinion has weight, and the general sentiment of the Court almost always carries the sovereign with it.<p><span class= "bld">That I might shew these my signs.</span>--There is nothing derogatory to the Divine Nature in a penal hardening being, as it were, utilised to increase the glory of God, and affect for good future generations of His people. The accumulation of plague upon plague, which the obduracy of Pharaoh and his subjects brought about, was of vast importance in presenting to Israel, and even to the surrounding nations, a manifestation of the tremendous power of God, calculated to impress them as nothing else would have done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-20.</span> - THE EIGHTH PLAGUE. Notwithstanding his self-condemnation and acknowledgment of the righteousness of God in all the judgments that had been sent upon him (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>), Pharaoh no sooner found that the seventh plague had ceased than he reverted to his old obstinacy. He both wilfully hardened his own heart (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>); and God, by the unfailing operation of his moral laws, further blunted or hardened it (<a href="/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>). Accordingly, it became necessary that his stubbornness should be punished by one other severe infliction. Locusts, God's "great army," as they are elsewhere called (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), were the instrument chosen, so that once more the judgment should seem to come from heaven, and that it should be exactly fitted to complete the destruction which the hail had left unaccomplished (ver. 5). Locusts, when they come in full force, are among the most terrible of all the judgments that can befall a country. "A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness" (<a href="/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>). They destroy every atom of foliage - crops, vegetables, shrubs, trees - even the bark of the fruit-trees suffers - the stems are injured, the smaller branches completely peeled and "made white" (<a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>). When Moses threatened this infliction, his words produced at once a great effect. The officers of the court - "Pharaoh's servants," as they are called - for the first time endeavoured to exert an influence over the king - "Let the men go," they said; "knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?" (ver. 7). And the king so far yielded that - also for the first time - he let himself be influenced by the mere threat of a judgment. He would have let the Israelites depart, before the locusts came, if only they would have left their "little ones" behind them (vers. 8-11 ). Moses, however, could not consent to this limitation; and so the plague came in fall severity the locusts covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with them (ver. 15); and all that the hail had left, including the whole of the wheat and <span class="accented">doora</span> harvests, was destroyed. Then Pharaoh made fresh acknowledgment of his sin, and fresh appeals for intercession - with the old result <span class="accented">that</span> the plague was removed, and <span class="accented">that</span> he remained as obdurate as ever (vers. 16-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go in unto Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart</span>. The word "I" is expressed in the original and is emphatic. It is not merely that Pharaoh has hardened himself (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>); but I have "dulled" or "hardened" him. Therefore condescend to see him once more, and to bear my message to him. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of his servants</span>. Compare <a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>. As Pharaoh's determination began to waver the influence of the court officers increased.
