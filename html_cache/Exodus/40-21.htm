Its placement in the tabernacle's Most Holy Place signified the heart of Israel's worship. The tabernacle, a portable sanctuary, was central to Israel's religious life during their wilderness journey. This act of bringing the ark into the tabernacle fulfilled God's instructions given to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>).<p><b>put up the veil for the screen</b><br>The veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, where the ark was kept. This barrier symbolized the separation between a holy God and sinful humanity. Only the high priest could pass beyond the veil, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>). The veil's tearing at Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) signifies the removal of this separation, granting believers direct access to God through Christ.<p><b>and shielded off the ark of the Testimony</b><br>The ark is referred to as the "ark of the Testimony" because it contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which were the testimony of God's covenant with Israel. Shielding the ark emphasized its sanctity and the reverence due to God's law. This act also highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands, as the ark was central to Israel's identity and relationship with God.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase underscores Moses' obedience to God's specific instructions. Throughout Exodus, Moses' adherence to God's commands is a recurring theme, demonstrating the importance of faithfulness and obedience in the life of God's people.
