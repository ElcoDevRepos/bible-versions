This act of consecration signifies setting apart for a holy purpose, reflecting the holiness required of those who serve God. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The process of consecration involves rituals that symbolize purification and dedication, emphasizing the need for holiness in approaching God.<p><b>Take a young bull and two rams without blemish,</b><br>The requirement for a young bull and two rams without blemish underscores the importance of offering God the best and purest sacrifices. The bull, often associated with sin offerings, represents atonement for sin, while the rams are linked to consecration and ordination. The stipulation of "without blemish" points to the necessity of perfection in sacrifices, prefiguring Christ, the sinless Lamb of God (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).

The method of it is now laid down. It consists of five things :--(1) Ablution (<a href="/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>); (2) Investiture (<a href="/context/exodus/29-5.htm" title="And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:">Exodus 29:5-9</a>); (3) Chrism, or anointing (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>); (4) Sacrifice (<a href="/context/exodus/29-10.htm" title="And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.">Exodus 29:10-23</a>); and (5) Filling the hand (<a href="/exodus/29-24.htm" title="And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.">Exodus 29:24</a>). All of these were symbolical acts, typical of things spiritual--ablution, of the putting away of impurity; investiture, of being clothed with holiness; unction, of the giving of Divine grace, &c.; the entire consecration forming an acted parable, very suggestive and full of instruction to such as understood its meaning. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-37.</span> - THE CONSECRATION OF THE PRIESTS.
