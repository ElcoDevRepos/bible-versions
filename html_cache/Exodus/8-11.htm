The departure of the frogs signifies God's control over creation and His ability to reverse the plagues He sends. It highlights the temporary nature of God's judgments when there is a call for repentance or acknowledgment of His power.<p><b>and your houses</b><br>The infestation of frogs had invaded personal spaces, symbolizing the pervasive nature of sin and its consequences. The removal from houses signifies a restoration of order and cleanliness, reflecting God's mercy in alleviating the suffering of the Egyptians despite Pharaoh's stubbornness.<p><b>and your officials</b><br>The mention of officials underscores the widespread impact of the plague, affecting not just common people but also the ruling class. This demonstrates that God's judgments are impartial and affect all levels of society. It also serves as a warning to those in authority about the consequences of opposing God's will.<p><b>and your people</b><br>The entire Egyptian population was affected by the plague, illustrating the collective suffering due to the decisions of their leader, Pharaoh. This communal aspect of the plague serves as a reminder of the corporate nature of sin and its repercussions on a nation.<p><b>they will remain only in the Nile.</b><br>The Nile, a source of life and sustenance for Egypt, becomes the sole habitat for the frogs after the plague. This return to their natural environment signifies a restoration of natural order. The Nile's mention also connects to the first plague, where the river was turned to blood, showing a pattern of God's control over Egypt's most vital resource. Theologically, it points to God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to use nature to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is resisting God's command to let the Israelites go.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who assists him in confronting Pharaoh and performing signs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people suffering from the plagues due to Pharaoh's hardened heart.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile_river.htm">The Nile River</a></b><br>A significant geographical feature in Egypt, central to the Egyptian economy and culture, and the place where the frogs will remain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The plagues demonstrate God's control over nature and His authority over earthly rulers.
