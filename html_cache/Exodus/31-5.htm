Gemstones were often used in ancient Near Eastern cultures for their beauty and symbolic meanings. In the context of the Tabernacle, gemstones were set in the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-21</a>), symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel. The cutting of gemstones required expertise, reflecting God's provision of skilled artisans like Bezalel, who were endowed with the Spirit of God for this purpose (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-4</a>). This craftsmanship can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the master craftsman of our faith, shaping and refining believers as precious stones in His spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><b>and to carve wood</b><br>Wood carving was another essential skill for the construction of the Tabernacle, as many of its components, such as the Ark of the Covenant, were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-11</a>). The use of wood signifies durability and the natural beauty of God's creation, which is transformed for His glory. The ability to carve wood into intricate designs reflects the creativity endowed by God to His people. This craftsmanship points to the work of the Holy Spirit in believers, who transforms and shapes them for God's purposes (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). The wood used in the Tabernacle can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the cross of Christ, where the ultimate sacrifice was made for humanity's redemption.<p><b>so that he may be a master of every craft</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the skills given to Bezalel and others involved in the Tabernacle's construction. Being a master of every craft implies a divinely inspired ability to excel in various forms of artistry and craftsmanship. This reflects the biblical principle that all gifts and talents come from God and are to be used for His glory (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The mastery of every craft can be seen as a parallel to the wisdom and knowledge of Christ, who is the source of all wisdom and understanding (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). It also serves as a reminder that believers are called to use their diverse gifts in unity for the edification of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle.
