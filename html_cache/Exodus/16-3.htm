It highlights their lack of faith and trust in God's deliverance. The "LORD's hand" signifies divine intervention, which they had witnessed through the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. Their desire to have died in Egypt rather than face uncertainty in the wilderness shows a failure to recognize God's ongoing provision and plan. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5-6</a>, where the Israelites reminisce about the food in Egypt, revealing a recurring pattern of ingratitude and forgetfulness.<p><b>&#8220;There we sat by pots of meat and ate our fill of bread,&#8221;</b><br>This statement is an idealized memory of their time in Egypt, where they were slaves. The "pots of meat" and "fill of bread" symbolize a sense of security and abundance, albeit in a context of oppression. Historically, Egypt was known for its agricultural wealth, which might have contributed to this perception. However, this memory is selective, ignoring the harsh realities of slavery. This longing for Egypt contrasts with the freedom God was leading them into, illustrating the human tendency to prefer familiar suffering over uncertain freedom.<p><b>&#8220;but you have brought us into this desert&#8221;</b><br>The "desert" or wilderness represents a place of testing and dependence on God. Geographically, the Sinai Peninsula is a harsh environment, emphasizing the Israelites' vulnerability and need for divine provision. This journey through the desert is a significant part of their transformation from a group of slaves to a nation under God's covenant. The desert experience is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the temptations of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where the wilderness serves as a place of preparation and reliance on God.<p><b>&#8220;to starve this whole assembly to death!&#8221;</b><br>This accusation against Moses and Aaron reveals the Israelites' fear and lack of faith. The term "assembly" refers to the entire community of Israel, highlighting the collective nature of their complaint. Their fear of starvation contradicts God's promise to provide for them, as seen later in the provision of manna (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-5</a>). This moment foreshadows the testing of faith that believers face, where trust in God's provision is essential. It also points to Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who provides spiritual sustenance and fulfillment beyond physical needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders appointed by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>A geographical location between Elim and Sinai where the Israelites camped and expressed their complaints.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, yet they nostalgically remember it as a place of abundance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and is guiding them to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The Israelites' complaint reveals a lack of trust in God's ability to provide.

It was the habit of the Egyptians to feed well those whom they employed in forced labours (Herod. ii. 125), just as slave-owners commonly do their slaves. The remembrance of the past abundance intensified the pain felt at the present want.<p><span class= "bld">To kill this whole assembly with hunger.</span>--It is difficult to imagine that there could have been as yet any real danger of starvation. The cattle may have suffered considerably in the passage through the wilderness of Shur, but the bulk of it survived (<a href="/exodus/17-3.htm" title="And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?">Exodus 17:3</a>), and there were lambs enough for the whole nation to observe a Passover a few months later at Sinai (<a href="/context/numbers/9-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,">Numbers 9:1-5</a>). But it may well be that a considerable number of the Israelites had had no cattle; others may have lost what they had, or have consumed them. Want may have stared some in the face, and the nation generally may have come to see that the prospect before them was a dismal one. Even supposing that the desert was anciently four or five times as productive as it is now, it could not possibly have afforded sufficient pasturage to maintain such flocks and herds as would have been requisite to support on their milk and flesh a population of two millions. It may have been brought home to the people that their flocks and herds were rapidly diminishing, and they may have realised the danger that impended of ultimate starvation after the cattle was all gone. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Would</span> <span class="cmt_word">to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt -</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Would that God had smitten us with a painless death, as he did the first-born of the Egyptians!
