This phrase echoes the rejection of God's messengers seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>, where the Israelites reject God as their king. It also foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Christ by the religious leaders in the New Testament (<a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>).<p><b>Pharaoh said to Moses.</b><br>Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, is a central figure in the Exodus narrative. His interactions with Moses highlight the spiritual battle between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine, which adds to the tension as Moses, a representative of the true God, confronts him. This confrontation is a type of the ultimate victory of Christ over the powers of darkness.<p><b>Make sure you never see my face again,</b><br>This phrase signifies a finality in Pharaoh's decision, showing his unwillingness to submit to God's will. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeing the face of a king was a privilege, and being denied this was a severe form of rejection. This mirrors the spiritual separation from God that results from sin, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>.<p><b>for on the day you see my face,</b><br>The phrase underscores the seriousness of Pharaoh's threat. In biblical terms, seeing someone's face often implies a personal encounter or relationship. Here, it is used to emphasize the broken relationship between Pharaoh and Moses, and by extension, between Pharaoh and God. This can be contrasted with the blessing of seeing God's face in peace, as described in <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>.<p><b>you will die.</b><br>Pharaoh's threat of death is ironic, given that it is he who will soon face the death of his firstborn and the destruction of his army. This statement highlights the theme of divine justice and retribution found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. It also prefigures the ultimate judgment that comes upon those who reject God's salvation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who is hardened in his heart against God&#8217;s commands delivered through Moses.

Each phrase exposes a progressively hardened heart, fulfilling God&#8217;s earlier warnings and setting the stage for the final plague. Pharaoh&#8217;s words showcase human pride colliding with divine sovereignty; the result will be judgment on Egypt and deliverance for Israel, proving yet again that &#8220;the LORD, He is God&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) G<span class= "bld">et thee from me.</span>--This address is ruds, fierce, uncourteous. That a Pharaoh of the nineteenth (or eighteenth?) dynasty should have so spoken implies extreme and very uncommon excitement. Generally the Pharaohs of this polished period were as imper turbable as Chinese mandarins. We must suppose that up to this time the king had persuaded himself that he would be able to bring Moses to a compromise, but that now at last he despaired of so doing; hence his anger and rudeness.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt die.</span>--Egyptian kings had the power of life and death, but rarely exercised it arbitrarily, or without trial. Very long and elaborate judicial processes have been found among the Egyptian remains. Still, no doubt, a monarch could put to death whomsoever he pleased; and so Egyptian courtiers were wont to acknowledge that they had lived to old age "by the favour of the king" (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">History of Egypt,</span> vol. i., p. 92).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh said</span>, etc. The reply of Pharaoh indicates violent anger. No doubt he thought that now the intention of Moses to deprive him altogether of the services of so many hundred thousand slaves was palpable, and scarcely concealed. Greatly enraged, he gives vent to his rage, with the want of self-control common among Oriental monarchs - rudely bids Moses be gone (<span class="cmt_word">Get thee from me</span>), threatens him (<span class="cmt_word">take heed to thyself</span>), and bids hires never more seek his presence, under the penalty of instant death, if he makes his appearance. Considering the degree of civilization, refinement, and politeness to which the Egyptians had attained under the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, such an outbreak must be regarded as abnormal, and as implying violent excitement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/10-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Depart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from me!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
