This phrase highlights the intimate relationship Moses has with God, emphasizing his role as a prophet and leader. The Hebrew term for "sought the favor" implies a deep, earnest plea, reflecting Moses' dedication and concern for the Israelites. This intercession is a pivotal moment, showcasing the power of prayer and the importance of a mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>saying, &#8220;O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people</b><br>Moses addresses God directly, using the covenant name "LORD" (YHWH), which signifies a personal and covenantal relationship. The question posed by Moses is rhetorical, meant to remind God of His promises and the special status of the Israelites as His chosen people. This reflects the cultural understanding of the time, where leaders often acted as advocates for their people, appealing to the mercy and justice of a higher authority.<p><b>whom You brought out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and God's faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of God's past acts of salvation and His commitment to His people. The mention of Egypt underscores the miraculous nature of their liberation, which was achieved through divine intervention. This historical context reinforces the argument that God should continue to show mercy to His people.<p><b>with great power and a mighty hand?</b><br>The "great power" and "mighty hand" are expressions of God's omnipotence and sovereignty. These terms are often used in the Old Testament to describe God's ability to perform miracles and deliver His people. This phrase connects to other scriptural references, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a> and <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>, which celebrate God's mighty acts. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, through His own power, delivers humanity from sin.
