It served as the dwelling place of God among His people. The tent and covering were made from fine linen and animal skins, symbolizing both the beauty and the protective nature of God's presence. The tabernacle prefigures Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying God's presence on earth.<p><b>its clasps and frames</b><br>The clasps and frames were essential for the structural integrity of the tabernacle, holding the curtains and boards together.

The meticulous design underscores the importance of every detail in God's plan, emphasizing that each part of the Church has a specific role and purpose.<p><b>its crossbars, posts, and bases</b><br>These elements provided stability and support for the tabernacle.
