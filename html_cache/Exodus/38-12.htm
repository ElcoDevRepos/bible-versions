This specific measurement reflects the detailed instructions given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9-13</a>). The precision in these dimensions underscores the importance of obedience to divine instructions. The number fifty can symbolize completeness or fullness in biblical numerology, often associated with the Jubilee year, a time of liberation and restoration (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>).<p><b>and had curtains</b><br>The curtains were made of fine twisted linen, as described earlier in <a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9</a>. These curtains served as a boundary for the sacred space, separating the holy from the common. The use of linen, a material associated with purity and righteousness, points to the holiness required to approach God. In the New Testament, the veil of the temple, also made of fine linen, was torn at Christ's crucifixion, symbolizing the new access to God through Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p><b>with ten posts and ten bases</b><br>The ten posts and bases provided structural support for the curtains. The number ten often represents completeness or divine order in Scripture, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>). The posts and bases were likely made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, materials that signify durability and judgment, respectively. This construction reflects the enduring nature of God's covenant and the judgment that separates the holy from the profane.<p><b>The hooks and bands of the posts were silver</b><br>Silver in the Bible often symbolizes redemption and atonement. The use of silver for the hooks and bands suggests the idea of redemption holding the structure together, much like the redemptive work of Christ holds the believer's life. In <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, silver was collected as atonement money, further linking it to the concept of redemption. The silver elements in the Tabernacle's construction foreshadow the redemptive work of Jesus, who is the ultimate atonement for sin (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_north_side_of_the_courtyard.htm">The North Side of the Courtyard</a></b><br>Part of the outer structure of the Tabernacle, specifically mentioned in this verse, indicating the detailed and precise nature of God's instructions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were responsible for contributing materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/precision_in_obedience.htm">Precision in Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle remind us of the importance of following God's commands with precision and care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The Tabernacle symbolizes God's desire to dwell among His people, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_contribution.htm">Community Contribution</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle required the collective effort and resources of the entire community, illustrating the importance of unity and cooperation in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_materials.htm">Symbolism of Materials</a></b><br>The use of bronze, silver, and other materials in the Tabernacle construction can be seen as symbolic of various aspects of God's character and His relationship with His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_reflection.htm">Spiritual Reflection</a></b><br>As the Tabernacle was a place of worship and sacrifice, believers are called to examine their own lives as living temples dedicated to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_38_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 38:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_38_12_God_s_detail_in_worship.htm">How does Exodus 38:12 reflect God's attention to detail in worship practices?
