The number twenty is symbolic in biblical numerology, often representing a complete or perfect waiting period. The frames were likely made of acacia wood, known for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. The use of frames instead of solid walls allowed for portability, reflecting the Israelites' nomadic lifestyle during their wilderness journey.<p><b>for the south side</b><br>The south side of the tabernacle was one of the longer sides, measuring approximately 45 feet in length. The orientation of the tabernacle was significant, with the entrance facing east, symbolizing the direction of the rising sun and new beginnings. The south side would have been to the right of someone entering the tabernacle, a position often associated with favor and strength in biblical texts. This orientation also aligns with the traditional layout of ancient Near Eastern temples, emphasizing the tabernacle's role as a sacred space.<p><b>of the tabernacle</b><br>The tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. It served as a central place of worship and sacrifice during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. The tabernacle's design was given directly by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, emphasizing its divine origin and purpose. It prefigures the temple in Jerusalem and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), fulfilling the role of mediator between God and humanity. The tabernacle's construction and function highlight themes of holiness, atonement, and God's desire to dwell with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for building the tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites traveled and where the tabernacle was constructed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The construction of the tabernacle highlights the importance of following God's specific instructions.
