The veil symbolized the separation between God and humanity due to sin. The altar's placement signifies the importance of prayer and intercession, as incense often represents prayers ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>).<p><b>that is before the ark of the Testimony</b><br>The ark of the Testimony, also known as the Ark of the Covenant, contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel. Its presence in the Most Holy Place signified God's throne on earth. The altar's proximity to the ark underscores the connection between God's law and the prayers of His people, highlighting the need for holiness and obedience in worship.<p><b>before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony</b><br>The mercy seat was the cover of the Ark of the Covenant, where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14-15</a>). This act symbolized atonement for the sins of Israel. The mercy seat represents God's throne of grace and foreshadows Christ's sacrificial work, as He is our propitiation (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>).<p><b>where I will meet with you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's desire for communion with His people.
