This interaction is part of the larger narrative of the plagues, where Moses acts as God's messenger. The departure indicates Moses' obedience to God's instructions and his role as an intermediary between God and Pharaoh. This moment reflects the ongoing struggle between God's will and Pharaoh's hardened heart, a theme prevalent throughout the Exodus narrative.<p><b>went out of the city</b><br>Moses leaving the city to pray is significant. In ancient Egypt, cities were centers of power and idolatry. By stepping outside, Moses symbolically distances himself from Egyptian influence and aligns with God's holiness. This act also demonstrates a separation from the corruption and sin associated with Pharaoh's rule, emphasizing the need for a sacred space to communicate with God.<p><b>and spread out his hands to the LORD</b><br>The gesture of spreading out hands is a posture of prayer and supplication, indicating Moses' earnest appeal to God. This physical act is a sign of humility and dependence on divine intervention. It is a common biblical motif seen in other scriptures, such as Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a>). This posture underscores the sincerity and urgency of Moses' request for the cessation of the plague.<p><b>The thunder and hail ceased</b><br>The cessation of thunder and hail demonstrates God's control over nature and His response to Moses' intercession. This event is part of the seventh plague, which was a direct challenge to the Egyptian god of the sky, Nut. The stopping of the storm at Moses' request highlights the power of the God of Israel over Egyptian deities and nature itself, reinforcing the theme of God's supremacy.<p><b>and the rain no longer poured down on the land</b><br>The end of the rain signifies the completion of this particular judgment upon Egypt. It serves as a tangible sign of God's mercy and the effectiveness of Moses' prayer. The cessation of the plague also foreshadows the eventual deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, symbolizing hope and restoration. This moment is a precursor to the ultimate redemption narrative found in the Exodus story, which is a type of the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

Though it still raged, he quitted the shelter of the city, and went out into the midst of it, and spread out his hands to God, when lo! at once the rain, and hail, and thunder ceased at his bidding, and soon "there was a great calm." As Millington observes--"Moses knew that he was safe, though all around might be destroyed; the very hairs of his head were all numbered, not one of them could perish. Standing there under the tempestuous canopy of heaven, bareheaded, in the attitude of prayer, he spread abroad his hands unto the Lord, and the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth" (<span class= "ital">Plagues of Egypt,</span> p. 135).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The rain was not poured upon the earth</span>. Rain had not been previously mentioned, as it was no part of the plague, that is, it caused no damage. But Moses, recording the cessation as an eye-witness, recollects that rain was mingled with the hail, and that, at his prayer, the thunder, the hail, and the rain all ceased. The touch is one which no later writer would have introduced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/9-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">departed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
