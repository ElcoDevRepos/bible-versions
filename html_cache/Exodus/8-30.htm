This phrase indicates a moment of transition, where Moses departs from the presence of Pharaoh after delivering God's message. The context here is the series of plagues that God sent upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery. This departure signifies Moses' role as an intermediary between God and Pharaoh, highlighting the tension between divine command and human authority. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine figures in Egyptian culture, making Moses' boldness in confronting Pharaoh significant.<p><b>and prayed to the LORD</b><br>Moses' prayer to the LORD demonstrates his reliance on God for guidance and intervention. This act of prayer is a recurring theme in Moses' leadership, emphasizing his role as a prophet and intercessor. The use of "LORD" in all capitals refers to the divine name YHWH, underscoring the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This prayer follows a pattern seen throughout the Exodus narrative, where Moses seeks God's will and power to accomplish what is humanly impossible. It also prefigures the mediatory role of Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity. Moses' prayer is a model of faith and obedience, trusting in God's promises and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central human figure in this passage, Moses is the prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
