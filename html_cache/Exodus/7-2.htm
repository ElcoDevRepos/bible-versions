In the biblical context, prophets were often tasked with delivering God's messages verbatim, highlighting the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's word. This command underscores the concept of divine inspiration, where the words spoken by the prophet are not his own but those of God. This is similar to the role of other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>), who were also instructed to speak only what God commanded.<p><b>and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh</b><br>Aaron's role as the spokesperson for Moses is significant, as it addresses Moses' earlier concerns about his own speaking abilities (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10-16</a>). This partnership between Moses and Aaron can be seen as a type of Christ and His Church, where Christ is the head and the Church acts as His voice in the world. Aaron's involvement also reflects the importance of teamwork and support within God's plans, as seen in other biblical partnerships like Paul and Barnabas in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>).<p><b>to let the Israelites go out of his land</b><br>This phrase highlights the central theme of the Exodus narrative: liberation from bondage. The Israelites' departure from Egypt is a pivotal event in biblical history, symbolizing God's deliverance and faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). The demand for release is not just a political or social request but a divine mandate, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations and rulers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
