It was not only a piece of clothing but also a blanket for warmth, especially during the cold nights. The cloak's significance is highlighted in the law, which protects the poor by ensuring that their basic needs are met. This reflects God's concern for justice and compassion towards the vulnerable. The cloak as a covering is reminiscent of God's provision and protection, as seen in other scriptures where God is described as a refuge and covering for His people (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>).<p><b>What else will he sleep in?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the necessity of the cloak for survival and dignity. It underscores the importance of empathy and understanding the plight of the poor. The question invites the listener to consider the basic human needs and the moral obligation to care for others. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of loving one's neighbor and providing for those in need, as seen in the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<p><b>And if he cries out to Me,</b><br>The phrase indicates a direct line of communication between the oppressed and God. It reflects the biblical principle that God hears the cries of the afflicted and responds to their suffering. This is consistent with the narrative of the Israelites in Egypt, where God heard their cries and delivered them (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-9</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's attentiveness and readiness to act on behalf of those who are wronged.<p><b>I will hear, for I am compassionate.</b><br>God's promise to hear is rooted in His compassionate nature. Compassion is a central attribute of God, frequently mentioned throughout the Bible. It is this compassion that drives divine justice and mercy. The assurance that God will hear and respond is a source of hope and comfort for the oppressed. This reflects the character of Jesus Christ, who embodied compassion and called His followers to do likewise (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>).

Just before the verse in focus, the Lord forbids charging interest to a fellow Israelite in need (v. 25). He then addresses collateral: if a destitute neighbor hands over his cloak so he can borrow money, it must be returned before sunset.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;his cloak is the only covering he has for his body&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The cloak doubled as a sleeping bag for a laborer who owned little else (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; To hold it overnight would strip him of basic warmth and dignity, ignoring the command to &#8220;love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord highlights the tangible need: this garment is not luxury; it is life-preserving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What else will he sleep in?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question underscores the lender&#8217;s responsibility to imagine himself in the borrower&#8217;s place (<a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Depriving someone of rest and security for the sake of safeguarding a loan shows a heart untouched by mercy (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law insists that economics be tethered to compassion, not cold calculation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And if he cries out to Me, I will hear&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The borrower may be powerless on earth, but he has an Advocate in heaven (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15, 17</a>).<p>&#8226; This warning reveals that justice is ultimately personal: mistreating the vulnerable provokes the Lord Himself (<a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; The cry of the oppressed sets divine intervention in motion; no earthly status can silence it (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;for I am compassionate&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s character anchors the command. He rescues because His nature is mercy (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The law reflects who He is; therefore, His people must mirror that compassion in daily dealings (<a href="/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Keeping the cloak command is not merely social policy; it is covenant loyalty to the compassionate God who &#8220;executes justice for the oppressed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/146-7.htm">Psalm 146:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living It Out Today</b><p>&#8226; Honor human dignity in every transaction, recognizing each person&#8217;s basic needs.<p>&#8226; Refuse to leverage another&#8217;s desperation for personal gain, whether in lending, employment, or contracts.<p>&#8226; Remember that God hears the unheard. Integrity matters even when no one else notices (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Express the Lord&#8217;s compassion tangibly: generous financial help, fair wages, timely repayment, practical care for shelter, food, and warmth (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a> uses a poor man&#8217;s cloak to spotlight God&#8217;s heart. The lender must return it nightly because the garment is his only protection. To ignore that need is to disregard God, who hears the cry of the oppressed and acts, for He is compassionate. The verse calls believers to mercy-shaped justice in every financial and relational decision, reflecting the Lord who safeguards the vulnerable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein shall he sleep?</span> The outer garment worn by the ancient Hebrews was like that of the modern Bedouins - a sort of large woollen shawl or blanket, in which they enveloped the greater part of their persons.
