This reflects a common pattern in the wilderness narratives where the people often direct their complaints to Moses, who serves as an intermediary between them and God. This highlights the burden of leadership and the people's reliance on Moses for guidance and provision.<p><b>Was it because there were no graves in Egypt</b><br>This sarcastic remark underscores the Israelites' fear and desperation. Egypt was known for its elaborate burial practices and numerous tombs, especially in the region of the Nile Delta where the Israelites lived. The irony in their statement reflects their panic and lack of faith, as they face what seems to be an impending disaster at the Red Sea.<p><b>that you brought us into the wilderness to die?</b><br>The wilderness, or desert, is often depicted in the Bible as a place of testing and trial. The Israelites' fear of dying in the wilderness contrasts with God's promise of deliverance and a land flowing with milk and honey. This phrase reveals their short-sightedness and inability to trust in God's plan, despite the miracles they had witnessed in Egypt.<p><b>What have you done to us</b><br>This question reflects the Israelites' tendency to blame Moses for their circumstances, a recurring theme throughout their journey. It shows their struggle with faith and trust, as they often revert to doubt and complaint when faced with challenges. This attitude is a reminder of the human tendency to question leadership and divine providence in times of crisis.<p><b>by bringing us out of Egypt?</b><br>The Israelites' longing to return to Egypt, despite their previous suffering, highlights the difficulty of embracing change and the unknown. Egypt, though a place of bondage, represented familiarity and security. This reflects a broader biblical theme of the struggle between the comfort of the past and the uncertainty of following God's call to a new future. It also foreshadows the ongoing struggle between faith and fear that characterizes the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

It is always a satisfaction to men to vent their anger upon some one when they are in a difficulty. No graves in ]Egypt.
