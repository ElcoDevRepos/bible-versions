Naming in biblical times often carried significant meaning, reflecting circumstances or prophetic insights. Eliezer's name serves as a testament to God's providence in Moses' life, particularly during his flight from Egypt. This naming also highlights the importance of remembering God's past faithfulness, a recurring theme in Israel's history.<p><b>for Moses had said</b><br>This phrase indicates that the naming of Eliezer was intentional and based on Moses' own testimony. It underscores the personal nature of Moses' relationship with God and his acknowledgment of God's intervention in his life. Moses' statement serves as a reminder of the importance of personal witness and testimony in the faith journey.<p><b>The God of my father was my helper</b><br>This phrase connects Moses to the patriarchal faith, emphasizing continuity with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It highlights the covenantal relationship that God maintained with Moses' ancestors and now with Moses himself. The term "helper" is significant, as it denotes God's active role in providing aid and support, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh</b><br>This refers to Moses' escape from Egypt after killing an Egyptian taskmaster, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>. The "sword of Pharaoh" symbolizes the threat of death and the oppressive power of Egypt. God's deliverance of Moses prefigures the later deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This act of deliverance is a type of Christ's ultimate deliverance of humanity from sin and death, showcasing God's power to save and protect His chosen ones.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage.

Eliezer had not been previously mentioned by name; but he was probably the son circumcised by Zipporah, as related in ch. 4:25. We learn from <a href="/1_chronicles/23-15.htm">1 Chronicles 23:15-17</a>, that he grew to manhood, and had an only son, Rehabiah, whose descendants were in the time of Solomon very numerous. <span class="cmt_word">For the God of my father, said he, was my help</span>. Eliezer means literally, "My God (is my) help." It would seem that Zipporah, when she circumcised her infant son, omitted to name him; but Moses, before dismissing her, supplied the omission, calling him Eliezer, because God had been his help against the Pharaoh who had sought his life (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>), and of whose death he had recently had intelligence (<a href="/exodus/4-19.htm">Exodus 4:19</a>). Thus the names of the two sons expressed respectively, the despondency natural to an exile, and the exultant gratitude of one who had just learned that by God's goodness, the term of his banishment was over. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/18-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The other [son]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
