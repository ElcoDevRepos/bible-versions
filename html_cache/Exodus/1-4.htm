Dan, the fifth son of Jacob, is often associated with judgment, as his name means "judge." The tribe of Dan later settled in the northern part of Israel, near the Mediterranean Sea. This location made them vulnerable to idolatry, as seen in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where they set up a carved image. Naphtali, the sixth son, is associated with freedom and swiftness, as his name means "my struggle" or "wrestling." The tribe of Naphtali settled in the fertile region of Galilee, which later became significant in the ministry of Jesus Christ, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>) about a great light shining in Galilee.<p><b>Gad and Asher.</b><br>Gad and Asher were also sons of Jacob, born to Zilpah, Leah's maidservant. Gad, the seventh son, is linked to fortune or a troop, as his name means "good fortune" or "troop." The tribe of Gad settled east of the Jordan River, in a region known for its pastures, which suited their lifestyle as herdsmen. This area was often a frontline in battles, requiring the Gadites to be strong warriors, as noted in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>. Asher, the eighth son, means "happy" or "blessed." The tribe of Asher settled along the northern coast of Canaan, an area rich in olive oil production, which is reflected in Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>. The prosperity of Asher is seen as a type of the spiritual blessings found in Christ, who provides abundantly for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dan.htm">Dan</a></b><br>Dan is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after Jacob's fifth son by Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.
