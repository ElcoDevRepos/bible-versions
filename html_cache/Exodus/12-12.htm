It marks the culmination of the ten plagues that God sent upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery. The timing underscores the immediacy and urgency of God's intervention.<p><b>I will pass through the land of Egypt</b><br>God's presence moving through Egypt signifies divine judgment and deliverance. This action is reminiscent of the theophany, where God manifests His presence in a tangible way. It also foreshadows the future deliverance of God's people, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ.<p><b>and strike down every firstborn male, both man and beast</b><br>The death of the firstborn is the final and most severe of the plagues, targeting the future and strength of Egypt. This act demonstrates God's power over life and death and serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian belief in the divine protection of their firstborn. It also prefigures the sacrifice of Jesus, the firstborn of all creation, who dies to bring life.<p><b>and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual warfare aspect of the plagues. Each plague systematically dismantles the authority of the Egyptian deities, demonstrating their impotence before the God of Israel. This judgment reveals the futility of idolatry and affirms the supremacy of the one true God.<p><b>I am the LORD</b><br>This declaration asserts God's identity and authority. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) is significant, as it is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature. It reassures the Israelites of His faithfulness and power to fulfill His promises, ultimately pointing to the revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of God's covenantal love and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, representing a place of oppression and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_firstborn.htm">The Firstborn</a></b><br>Both human and animal firstborns in Egypt, symbolizing the strength and future of the nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover_night.htm">The Passover Night</a></b><br>The pivotal event where God executes judgment, leading to the liberation of the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gods_of_egypt.htm">The Gods of Egypt</a></b><br>The deities worshiped by the Egyptians, which are shown to be powerless before Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is supreme over all nations and deities.

The death of all the firstborn beasts would have been felt by the Egyptians as a heavy judgment upon their gods. Some of their sacred animals were regarded as actual incarnations of deity; and if any of these perished, as is likely, the threat would have been executed to the letter. But even apart from this, as cows, sheep, goats, cats, dogs, jackals, crocodiles, hippopotami, apes, ibises, frogs, &c, were sacred, either throughout Egypt or in parts of it, a general destruction of all firstborn animals would have been felt as a blow dealt to the gods almost equally.<p><span class= "bld">I am the Lord.</span>--Heb. I, <span class= "ital">Jehovah.</span> The construction is, "I, Jehovah, will execute judgment."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I will pass through</span>, etc. God now proceeds to give the reason for the institution of the new ceremony, and to explain the new term <span class="accented">pesach.</span> "I have commanded this rite," He says, "because I am about to go through the whole land of Egypt as a destroyer, executing judgment; I am about to smite and kill every one of the firstborn both of man and beast. I shall enter into every house, and slay the first-born in it, unless I see upon the house the token of the blood of the lamb. In that ease I shall <span class="accented">pass over</span> the house, and you will escape the plague." It would clear the sense if the opening words of verse 12 were translated - "For I shall go through," instead of "pass through." The word translated "pass through" has no connection at all with that rendered "pass over." <span class="cmt_word">Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment</span>. These words are exegetical of the word "beast," which immediately precedes. Animal worship was an important part of the religion of the Egyptians. At four great cities, Memphis, Heliopolis, Hermonthis, a sort of suburb of Thebes, and Momemphis in the Western Delta, animals were maintained, which were viewed as actual incarnations of deity - the Apis Bull at Memphis, a bull called Mnevis at Heliopolis, one termed Bacis or Pacts at Hermonthis, and at Momemphis a White Cow. If any of these were at the time animals that had "opened the womb," death must have fallen upon them. Thus would judgment have been executed, literally, upon Egyptian "gods." But, besides these, the whole country was filled with sacred animals, regarded as emblematic of certain particular deities, and as belonging to them. Sheep were sacred to Kneph, goats to Khem, cows to Athor, cats to Pasht, dogs and jackals to Anubis, lions to Horus, crocodiles to Set and Sabak, hippopotami to Taouris, cynocephalous apes to Thoth, frogs to Heka. A sudden mortality among the sacred animals would be felt by the Egyptians as a blow struck against the gods to whom they belonged, and as a judgment upon them. It is scarcely necessary to understand literally the expression "all the gods," and to defend it by the assertion that "not a single deity of Egypt but was represented by some beast." Such an assertion cannot be proved; and is probably not correct. It has often been remarked, and is generally allowed, that Scripture uses universal expressions, where most, or even many, of a class are meant. I am the Lord. Rather as in <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>, "Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment, I, Jehovah." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
