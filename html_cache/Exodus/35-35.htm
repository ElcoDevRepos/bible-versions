In the context of Exodus, God specifically equips individuals for the construction of the Tabernacle.

Blue, purple, and scarlet were colors associated with royalty and divinity, often used in the garments of priests and the Tabernacle itself (<a href="/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>). Fine linen represents purity and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>.<p><b>and as weavers</b><br>Weaving was an essential skill for creating the fabrics used in the Tabernacle. This craft required patience and attention to detail, symbolizing the intricate and interconnected nature of God's plan and His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-14</a>, where God is described as weaving us together in the womb.<p><b>as artistic designers of every kind of craft.</b><br>This phrase highlights the creativity and artistry involved in the Tabernacle's construction.
