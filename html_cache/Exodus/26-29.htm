Gold, being a precious and incorruptible metal, symbolizes purity and holiness. In the ancient Near East, gold was often associated with royalty and deity, underscoring the sacredness of the tabernacle as God's dwelling place among His people. The overlaying of the frames with gold points to the heavenly reality and the majesty of God's presence. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies the divine nature in human form, as described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<p><b>and make gold rings to hold the crossbars</b><br>The gold rings served a practical purpose, allowing the crossbars to stabilize the structure of the tabernacle. Symbolically, the rings and crossbars represent unity and strength within the body of believers, as the tabernacle was a place of communal worship and meeting with God. The use of gold for the rings emphasizes the importance of maintaining holiness and integrity in the community of faith. This can be connected to <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>, where the body of Christ is described as being joined and held together, growing in love and unity.<p><b>Also overlay the crossbars with gold</b><br>The crossbars, like the frames, were overlaid with gold, reinforcing the theme of divine presence and holiness throughout the tabernacle. This complete covering with gold signifies that every aspect of the tabernacle was to reflect God's glory. The crossbars' role in supporting the structure can be seen as a type of Christ's sustaining power in the church, as He is the one who holds all things together (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). The overlaying of gold on the crossbars also points to the idea that every part of our lives should be consecrated and dedicated to God's service, reflecting His glory in all we do.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were on their way to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments and the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>The use of gold in the Tabernacle signifies the holiness and majesty of God.
