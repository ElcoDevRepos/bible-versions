The "whole congregation of Israel" refers to the entire assembly of the Israelites, emphasizing the communal nature of their covenant relationship with God. This gathering underscores the importance of the message being delivered, as it pertains to the collective responsibility and participation of the nation. Historically, this reflects the theocratic structure of Israelite society, where divine instructions were central to their identity and governance.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded:</b><br>The phrase highlights the divine authority behind the instructions Moses is about to deliver. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the covenant name of God, reminding the Israelites of His eternal and unchanging nature. This command is not a suggestion but a directive from God, emphasizing obedience and reverence. The context here is the preparation for the construction of the Tabernacle, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. This command connects to the broader narrative of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in earlier passages like <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God calls Israel to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage and to guide them through the wilderness.
