This phrase highlights his stubbornness and unwillingness to acknowledge the power of the God of Israel. In the broader biblical narrative, Pharaoh's hard-heartedness serves as a backdrop for God's demonstration of His power and sovereignty. This turning away is symbolic of his spiritual blindness and resistance to divine intervention.<p><b>went into his palace</b><br>The palace represents Pharaoh's seat of power and authority. It is a place of comfort and security for him, contrasting with the suffering of the Israelites. Historically, Egyptian palaces were grand and opulent, reflecting the wealth and might of the Pharaohs. This retreat into his palace signifies Pharaoh's attempt to insulate himself from the reality of God's judgment and the plight of the Israelites.<p><b>and did not take any of this to heart</b><br>This phrase underscores Pharaoh's hardened heart, a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative. Despite witnessing the signs and wonders, he remains unmoved and unrepentant. Biblically, the heart is often seen as the center of one's will and emotions. Pharaoh's refusal to take the events to heart illustrates his rebellion against God. This hardening of the heart is echoed in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereignty in hardening whom He wills. Pharaoh's attitude contrasts with the call to repentance and humility before God, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures who responded to God's call with faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against the Israelites and their God.
