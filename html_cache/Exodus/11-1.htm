Moses is portrayed as a prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from bondage. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of Moses' mission. It also reflects the intimate relationship between God and Moses, as seen throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>I will bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt one more plague</b><br>The term "plague" refers to a series of divine judgments that God inflicted upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. This final plague, the death of the firstborn, is the culmination of God's judgments and is significant in its severity and impact. It demonstrates God's power over life and death and serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian pantheon, particularly against the supposed divine status of Pharaoh himself. The plagues collectively reveal God's sovereignty and justice.<p><b>After that, he will allow you to leave this place</b><br>This statement is a prophecy of the impending liberation of the Israelites. It highlights God's foreknowledge and control over the events that will unfold. The phrase "this place" refers to Egypt, where the Israelites have been enslaved for centuries. The promise of leaving signifies the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to bring their descendants to the Promised Land.<p><b>And when he lets you go, he will drive you out completely</b><br>The phrase indicates not only permission to leave but an urgent expulsion. Pharaoh's eventual decision to drive the Israelites out reflects the overwhelming impact of the final plague. This expulsion is a reversal of the previous refusals and hardening of Pharaoh's heart. It also symbolizes the complete and total deliverance that God provides, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance from sin through Jesus Christ. The urgency and completeness of the departure foreshadow the decisive nature of God's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is orchestrating the deliverance of His people from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, who is receiving direct instructions from God to lead the Israelites out of bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart has been hardened against letting the Israelites go, despite witnessing previous plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and the setting for the plagues that demonstrate God's power and judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague.htm">The Plague</a></b><br>The final and decisive act of judgment that God will bring upon Egypt, leading to the liberation of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_timing.htm">God's Sovereignty and Timing</a></b><br>God's plan unfolds according to His perfect timing.

He had also been told that the time was now come when the promise made to him in Mount Horeb, that his people should "spoil the Egyptians" (<a href="/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>), would receive its accomplishment. The Israelites, before departing, were to ask their Egyptian neighbours for any articles of gold and silver that they possessed, and would receive them (ver. 2). The reasons for this extraordinary generosity on the part of the Egyptians are then mentioned, in prolongation of the parenthesis.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
