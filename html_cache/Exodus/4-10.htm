The use of "Lord" indicates recognition of God's authority. This moment occurs at the burning bush, a pivotal event in Moses' life where God commissions him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses' response reflects his initial reluctance and self-doubt, a common human reaction when faced with a divine calling.<p><b>&#8220;I have never been eloquent,</b><br>Moses expresses his perceived inadequacy in speech. Historically, Moses was raised in Pharaoh's court, suggesting he had some education. However, his self-assessment highlights a lack of confidence. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God using the weak and humble to accomplish His purposes, as seen with other figures like Gideon and David.<p><b>neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant,</b><br>Moses emphasizes his consistent struggle with speech, even after divine encounters. This suggests that his concern is deeply rooted and not merely situational. The phrase "since You have spoken" indicates that Moses expected a transformation upon encountering God, yet he perceives no change, highlighting his reliance on human ability rather than divine empowerment.<p><b>for I am slow of speech and tongue.&#8221;</b><br>Moses describes his speech impediment, which some scholars suggest could be a stutter or difficulty in articulation. This physical limitation is significant in the cultural context of ancient Egypt, where eloquence was highly valued. Despite this, God chooses Moses, foreshadowing the New Testament principle that God's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). Moses' role as a type of Christ is evident here, as both are chosen leaders who deliver God's people, yet Christ is the perfect fulfillment without human limitation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

The verse reminds us that reluctance can coexist with reverence, and that God delights in displaying His power through vessels keenly aware of their weaknesses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">I am not eloquent.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">No man of words am I. </span>Moses, still reluctant, raises a new objection.

The phrase used by Moses is full of force. It is "vox dolentis et supplicantis" (Noldius). Joseph's brethren use it to the steward of Joseph's house, when they expect to be fallen upon and taken for bondsmen (<a href="/genesis/43-20.htm">Genesis 43:20</a>); Judah used it (<a href="/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>) when pleading with Joseph for Benjamin; Aaron when pleading for Miriam (<a href="/numbers/13-11.htm">Numbers 13:11</a>); Joshua when expostulating with God about Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-8.htm">Joshua 7:8</a>). There is a deprecatory idea in it, as well as a supplicatory one; an idea like that which Abraham expanded into the words, "Oh! let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once" (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>). Moses feels that he is trying the patience of God to the uttermost; but yet he must make one more effort to escape his mission. I am not eloquent. Literally, as in the margin, "a man of words." "Words do not come readily to my tongue when I attempt to speak; I have never been a fluent speaker, neither yesterday (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> recently) nor the day before (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> formerly). Nor do I even find that I have become eloquent by divine inspiration since thou spakest with me. Still I remain slow of speech and slow of tongue." A question is raised whether the mere difficulty of finding words and giving them utterance - a difficulty felt at first by almost every speaker - is here meant, or something further, as "a natural impediment owing to defect in the organs of speech" (Kalisch), or a want of readiness, owing to disuse, in speaking the Hebrew language (Clarke). The latter suggestion is scarcely consistent with the ease and fluency with which Moses had carried on the conversation in Hebrew up to this point. The former is a possible meaning, though not a necessary one.
