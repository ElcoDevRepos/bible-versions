This shape symbolizes perfection and completeness, reflecting God's perfect justice and order. The square shape also ensured that the breastpiece could securely hold the twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel, emphasizing the unity and equality of the tribes before God. The folding over double may indicate the importance of protection and the hidden nature of divine wisdom, as the Urim and Thummim were placed within it, used for discerning God's will.<p><b>a span long and a span wide</b><br>A span, approximately nine inches, was a common ancient measurement based on the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger when the hand is fully extended. This specific size ensured that the breastpiece was both functional and symbolic, fitting perfectly over the heart of the High Priest. The dimensions highlight the personal and intimate nature of the High Priest's role as an intercessor for the people, carrying them close to his heart. This can be seen as a type of Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who intercedes for us and carries us in His heart. The precise measurements also reflect the meticulous nature of God's instructions for worship and the importance of obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the priestly garments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breastpiece.htm">The Breastpiece</a></b><br>A sacred garment worn by the High Priest, made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen, folded to form a square.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The chief religious leader of the Israelites, who wore the breastpiece as part of his ceremonial attire.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, for whom the Tabernacle and its furnishings were constructed as a means of worship and communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_breastpiece.htm">Symbolism of the Breastpiece</a></b><br>The breastpiece represents the High Priest's role in bearing the names of the tribes of Israel before God, symbolizing intercession and remembrance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/precision_and_obedience.htm">Precision and Obedience</a></b><br>The specific measurements and materials used in the breastpiece highlight the importance of following God's instructions with precision and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_guidance.htm">God's Presence and Guidance</a></b><br>The breastpiece, part of the High Priest's attire, signifies God's presence and guidance, reminding us of the importance of seeking God's direction in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_prayer.htm">Intercession and Prayer</a></b><br>Just as the High Priest interceded for the Israelites, we are called to intercede for others in prayer, bringing their needs before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_high_priest.htm">Christ as Our High Priest</a></b><br>The breastpiece foreshadows Christ's role as our High Priest, who continually intercedes for us, offering us access to God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_39_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 39:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_39_9_Precision_in_God_s_orders.htm">How does Exodus 39:9 emphasize the importance of precision in God's instructions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Breastpiece_s_priestly_symbolism.htm">What does the "doubled" breastpiece symbolize in the context of priestly duties?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_square_folded_spiritually.htm">How can we apply the concept of "square and folded" to our spiritual lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_39_9_s_link_to_obedience_theme.htm">How does Exodus 39:9 connect to the broader theme of obedience in Exodus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_craftsmanship_in_Exodus_39_9.htm">What lessons on craftsmanship and dedication can we learn from Exodus 39:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_breastpiece_square_in_Exodus_2.htm">What is the significance of the breastpiece being square in Exodus 39:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_39_9_Precision_in_worship.htm">How does Exodus 39:9 reflect the importance of precision in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_fold_the_breastpiece_double_Ex_39_9.htm">Why was the breastpiece folded double according to Exodus 39:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_39.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/biblical_weights_and_measures.htm">What are the Biblical weights and measures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_deut._9_13-21_align_with_ex._32.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13-21 -

A square carries the idea of balance and completeness, mirroring the character of God who is perfectly just and orderly.<p>- The most sacred spaces in Scripture share this geometry: the Holy of Holies measured equally in every direction (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>, &#8220;The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high&#8221;), and the New Jerusalem is pictured the same way (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). Each example underscores holiness, stability, and God-centered design.<p>- In practical terms, a square breastpiece would hang evenly over the ephod, preventing any tilt that could dislodge the twelve stones (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-21</a>). The symmetrical form safeguarded the representation of Israel&#8217;s tribes, declaring that God shows no partiality&#8212;each tribe is equally precious before Him (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when folded over double</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;when folded over double&#8221; means the material was doubled back on itself, creating a pocket-like construction (<a href="/exodus/28-16.htm">Exodus 28:16</a>). This double layer added strength so the weight of the gemstones would not tear the fabric.<p>- It also formed a secure place for the Urim and Thummim, the instruments by which the high priest sought God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The doubled cloth therefore speaks of protection and safekeeping&#8212;nothing of God&#8217;s revelation was to be lost or treated casually.<p>- Throughout Scripture, God&#8217;s people are pictured as being covered or folded into His care. <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a> says, &#8220;He will cover you with His feathers; under His wings you will find refuge.&#8221; The breastpiece&#8217;s double layer is a tangible reminder that the Lord&#8217;s guidance and covenant promises are safely kept.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a span long</b><p>- A span is roughly the distance between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the small finger&#8212;about nine inches. This literal, measurable detail roots the text in real history, affirming that God cares about precise obedience (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>).<p>- Similar concrete measurements appear elsewhere: Goliath&#8217;s height (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>) and the altar dimensions in Ezekiel&#8217;s vision (<a href="/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>). Such specificity teaches that worship is not shaped by human preference but by divine instruction.<p>- For the high priest, the span length ensured the breastpiece rested appropriately over the heart (<a href="/exodus/28-29.htm">Exodus 28:29</a>), symbolizing that the people of Israel were carried close to the priest&#8217;s&#8212;and ultimately God&#8217;s&#8212;heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a span wide</b><p>- Matching length and width confirm the &#8220;square&#8221; statement, reinforcing total proportionality. Every side of the priestly garment corresponded precisely, much like God&#8217;s laws correspond perfectly with His character (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>, &#8220;The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul&#8221;).<p>- The even width provided equal display space for each of the twelve stones, once again emphasizing the equal standing of every tribe (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>, &#8220;Show no favoritism&#8221;).<p>- By ordering the width as well as the length, God signaled that nothing in worship was left to chance; every inch served a purpose in honoring Him and blessing His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/39-9.htm">Exodus 39:9</a>, with its brief description&#8212;&#8220;It was square when folded over double, a span long and a span wide&#8221;&#8212;reveals more than fabric dimensions. The square shape proclaims God&#8217;s perfection and impartiality, the doubled cloth guards divine revelation, and the measured span anchors worship in precise obedience. Together, these details point to a God who designs every element of worship to reflect His holy character and to keep His people ever before His heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For a memorial</span>.
