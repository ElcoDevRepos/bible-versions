This role is significant as it establishes Moses as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The message Moses relayed was one of hope and deliverance, as God had promised to free the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant people, as seen in His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p><b>but on account of their broken spirit</b><br>The Israelites' broken spirit indicates a state of deep despair and hopelessness. This condition was a result of prolonged suffering and oppression under Egyptian slavery. The Hebrew term used here can also imply impatience or anguish, highlighting the emotional and psychological toll of their bondage. This mirrors the human condition under sin, where spiritual bondage leads to a broken spirit, necessitating divine intervention for redemption (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p><b>and cruel bondage</b><br>The cruel bondage refers to the harsh and oppressive conditions the Israelites faced in Egypt. Historically, this period of slavery involved forced labor and severe treatment, as described earlier in Exodus (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). This context underscores the severity of their plight and the need for divine deliverance. Theologically, it serves as a metaphor for the bondage of sin, from which Christ delivers believers (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>).<p><b>they did not listen to him</b><br>The Israelites' inability to listen to Moses reflects their lack of faith and hope due to their suffering. This response is a recurring theme in the wilderness narratives, where the Israelites often doubted God's promises and provision (<a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). It highlights the challenge of maintaining faith amidst trials and foreshadows the necessity of a new covenant, where God promises to give His people a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, tasked by God to deliver His message and lead His people out of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are suffering under the harsh bondage of Egyptian slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of oppression and hardship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise.htm">God's Promise</a></b><br>The assurance given by God to Moses that He will deliver the Israelites from slavery and bring them to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_brokenness.htm">Understanding Brokenness</a></b><br>Recognize that a broken spirit can hinder our ability to hear and trust God's promises.

Now they could not even be induced to listen. But there is nothing strange in this. The reason is obvious. The first announcement of coming deliverance elated them with a hope to which they had been long strangers. Their spirits sprang to the message, and readily accepted it. But now they had been chilled by disappointment. The only result of their leader's interference hitherto had been to increase their misery (<a href="/context/exodus/4-7.htm" title="And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again.

The Israelites, who had expected a speedy deliverance, and found themselves only the more down-trodden for Moses' interference, were too much dispirited to be cheered even by the gracious promises and assurances which Moses was commissioned to give. They had no longer any trust in one who they thought had deceived them. He was a dreamer, a visionary, if no worse. They did not intend hearkening to him any more. "Anguish of spirit" possessed their souls, and "cruel bondage" claimed their bodies, day after day.
