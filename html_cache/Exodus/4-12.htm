It reflects God's sovereign will and His plan for Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. The command echoes the call of other biblical figures, such as Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, where God instructs him to leave his country. It signifies a pivotal moment of obedience and faith, requiring Moses to trust in God's plan despite his own insecurities.<p><b>I will help you as you speak,</b><br>God's promise to assist Moses addresses Moses' earlier concerns about his speaking abilities (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). This assurance highlights God's provision and empowerment, reminiscent of His support to other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). It underscores the theme of divine enablement, where God equips those He calls, ensuring that human limitations do not hinder His purposes.<p><b>and I will teach you what to say.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates God's ongoing guidance and instruction, suggesting a relationship where God actively communicates His will. It parallels the promise given to the disciples in the New Testament, where Jesus assures them that the Holy Spirit will teach them what to say in times of persecution (<a href="/luke/12-12.htm">Luke 12:12</a>). This reflects the continuity of God's guidance throughout biblical history and foreshadows the role of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

After addressing Moses&#8217; fears (<a href="/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1&#8211;11</a>), God cuts through hesitation with a decisive call.<p>- Similar urgency appears when Jesus tells His disciples, &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Obedience is expected without delay.<p>- Abraham&#8217;s prompt departure at God&#8217;s word (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) models the same faith&#8211;driven response.<p>- The lesson: God&#8217;s people do not wait for perfect conditions; they move forward because His word is sufficient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will help you as you speak</b><p>- God promises ongoing aid, not a one-time boost. He will be present in Moses&#8217; very act of speaking.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah heard a like assurance: &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230; for I am with you to deliver you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus told the apostles, &#8220;It is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-20.htm">Matthew 10:20</a>).<p>- Divine help neutralizes human weakness. Paul confessed, &#8220;My message&#8230; was a demonstration of the Spirit&#8217;s power&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>).<p>- We learn that reliance on God, not eloquence, is the key to effective witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will teach you what to say</b><p>- The Lord Himself becomes Moses&#8217; instructor, guaranteeing accuracy and authority in every word delivered.<p>&#8226; Isaiah testified, &#8220;The Lord God has given Me the tongue of disciples&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus declared complete dependence on the Father&#8217;s instruction: &#8220;I speak just as the Father has told Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s teaching is moment-by-moment. In <a href="/luke/12-12.htm">Luke 12:12</a>, Jesus comforts His followers: &#8220;The Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say.&#8221;<p>- Application: We prepare faithfully, yet we trust God to supply the exact words needed in each circumstance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a> reveals a threefold pattern for every servant of God: respond promptly, rely completely, and receive continually.
