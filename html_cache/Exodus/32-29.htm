In the context of <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, it follows the incident of the golden calf, where the Israelites engaged in idolatry while Moses was on Mount Sinai. Moses' leadership is crucial here, as he addresses the people after a period of judgment and intercession.<p><b>&#8220;Today you have been ordained for service to the LORD,</b><br>The ordination mentioned here refers to the Levites, who responded to Moses' call to stand with the LORD against the idolatry of the golden calf. This act set them apart for priestly service. The concept of ordination involves being set apart for a holy purpose, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in the consecration of priests and the calling of prophets.<p><b>since each man went against his son and his brother;</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of the situation and the commitment required to uphold God's holiness. The Levites' willingness to execute judgment, even against their own kin, underscores the seriousness of idolatry and the priority of allegiance to God over familial ties. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> about the cost of discipleship.<p><b>so the LORD has bestowed a blessing on you this day.&#8221;</b><br>The blessing here is both a reward for their faithfulness and a recognition of their new role. In biblical terms, blessings often follow acts of obedience and faithfulness. This blessing can be seen as a precursor to the Levites' ongoing role in Israel's religious life, as they later become the tribe responsible for the tabernacle and temple services. The concept of blessing is central to the Abrahamic covenant and is fulfilled in various ways throughout Scripture, ultimately pointing to the spiritual blessings found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt.
