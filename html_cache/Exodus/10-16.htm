This is the eighth plague, locusts, which devastated Egypt's agriculture. The quick summoning indicates a moment of crisis, showing Pharaoh's recognition of the power of the God of Israel. Historically, Egyptian rulers were seen as divine or semi-divine, so Pharaoh's actions here reveal a significant moment of vulnerability and acknowledgment of a higher power.<p><b>and said, &#8220;I have sinned against the LORD your God</b><br>Pharaoh's admission of sin is significant, as it shows a momentary acknowledgment of wrongdoing against the God of Israel. This is one of the few instances where Pharaoh admits fault, highlighting the impact of the plagues. The phrase "the LORD your God" indicates Pharaoh's recognition of the distinct and powerful nature of the God of the Hebrews, contrasting with the polytheistic beliefs of Egypt. This admission can be seen as a precursor to the concept of repentance, though Pharaoh's subsequent actions reveal a lack of true repentance.<p><b>and against you.</b><br>By admitting he has sinned against Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh acknowledges the role of God's messengers. This admission underscores the authority given to Moses and Aaron as representatives of God. It also reflects the personal nature of the conflict, as Pharaoh's stubbornness directly opposed the mission of Moses and Aaron. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's chosen leaders being instruments of His will, as seen in other figures like David and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is repeatedly confronted by Moses to let the Israelites go.

The eighth plague left &#8220;no green thing&#8230;in all the land of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>), so the king acts without delay.<p>&#8226; His urgency shows that even the most powerful earthly ruler is helpless before the LORD&#8217;s hand (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>;

Earlier, he had done the same after the frog and hail judgments (<a href="/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>; 9:27&#8211;28); each time, the crisis drives him back, showing the cycle of fear without lasting change.<p>&#8226;

Yet his language&#8212;&#8220;the LORD your God&#8221;&#8212;betrays a heart still at arm&#8217;s length from true submission.
