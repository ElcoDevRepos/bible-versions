This reflects the harsh conditions and oppression the Israelites faced in Egypt. The taskmasters' relentless pressure symbolizes the increasing burden of slavery, which is a recurring theme in the narrative of Exodus. This oppression sets the stage for God's deliverance, highlighting the need for divine intervention.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Fulfill your quota each day</b><br>The demand to fulfill the daily quota emphasizes the severity of the Israelites' bondage. The quota refers to the number of bricks the Israelites were required to produce.

It also serves as a backdrop for understanding the miraculous nature of their eventual liberation.<p><b>just as you did when straw was provided.&#8221;</b><br>Straw was a crucial component in brick-making, used to bind the clay. Previously, the Egyptians supplied straw, but now the Israelites had to gather it themselves, making their task even more arduous. This change in circumstances highlights the increasing severity of their oppression. The removal of straw can be seen as a test of faith and endurance, paralleling the trials believers face and the need to rely on God's strength.

The overseers are represented as continually saying to the workpeople, "Work without faintness." (See Wilkinson, in Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Herodotus,</span> vol. ii. p. 214.)<p><span class= "bld">As when there was straw.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">as when there, was the straw</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as. when the straw was furnished to you.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The taskmasters hasted them</span>. The Egyptian overseers, armed with rods, went about among the toiling Israelites continually, and "hasted them" by dealing out blows freely on all who made any pause in their work. The unceasing toil lasted from morning to night; yet still the required" tale" could not be produced; and consequently the native officers, whose business it was to produce the "tale," were punished by the bastinado at the close of the day not giving in the proper amount. Kalisch observes - "Even now the Arabic fellahs, whose position is very analogous to that of the Israelites described in our text, are treated by the Turks in the same manner. Arabic overseers have to give an account of the labours of their countrymen to the Turkish taskmasters, who often chastise them mercilessly for the real or imputed cf. fences of the Arabic workmen." <p> CHAPTER 5:15-19 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The taskmasters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1490;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;han&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
