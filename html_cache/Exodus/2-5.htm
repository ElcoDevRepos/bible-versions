Her presence by the Nile reminds us that even those in authority move under God&#8217;s sovereign plan (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Bathing in the Nile was common for Egyptian nobility&#8212;yet here the ordinary act becomes the setting for divine intervention, echoing how God later uses ordinary water in the Red Sea to accomplish deliverance (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20-21</a> notes that Moses &#8220;was brought up for three months in his father&#8217;s house; and after he was exposed, Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter adopted him.&#8221; The New Testament affirms this historical event.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and her attendants were walking along the riverbank</b><p>&#8226; The attendants (servant girls) testify to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s status, but they also serve as unwitting witnesses and participants in God&#8217;s rescue plan (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Their leisurely walk contrasts with the anxiety of Israelite mothers under Pharaoh&#8217;s edict to kill Hebrew boys (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>). God is already turning the oppressor&#8217;s household into the place of protection (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The riverbank setting anticipates later scenes where Israel will gather by bodies of water to meet God&#8217;s provision&#8212;Elim&#8217;s wells (<a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>) and the Jordan crossing (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when she saw the basket among the reeds</b><p>&#8226; The basket is exactly where Moses&#8217; family placed it, showing obedience rewarded (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>).

An Egyptian princess, surrounded by attendants, notices a tiny basket nestled in reeds and sends for it. Each detail showcases the Lord steering events so that the very household enforcing death on Hebrew infants becomes the shelter for Israel&#8217;s future deliverer.

There is nothing improbable in an Egyptian princess bathing in the Nile, at a place reserved for women. (See Wilkinson, 'Manners and Customs of Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 389.)
