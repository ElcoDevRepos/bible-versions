In the ancient Near Eastern context, women often engaged in textile work, a vital part of daily life and religious practices. The mention of "skilled women" indicates that these women possessed specific talents and expertise, which were highly valued in the community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using individuals with diverse gifts for His purposes, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>, which praises the industrious and capable woman.<p><b>whose hearts were stirred</b><br>The phrase suggests a divine prompting or inspiration, indicating that these women were moved by God to contribute their skills. This mirrors the broader biblical principle that God stirs the hearts of His people to accomplish His work, as seen in <a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>, where God stirs the hearts of the people to rebuild the temple. It underscores the importance of willing and heartfelt service in the work of God, aligning with New Testament teachings such as <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, which emphasizes giving and serving with a cheerful heart.<p><b>spun the goat hair</b><br>Goat hair was a common material used in the ancient world for making durable and weather-resistant fabrics, suitable for the Tabernacle's coverings. The spinning of goat hair into fabric was a skilled task, requiring precision and expertise. This practical contribution was essential for the construction of the Tabernacle, which served as the dwelling place of God among His people. The use of goat hair also connects to the broader biblical theme of sacrifice and atonement, as goats were often used in sacrificial offerings (<a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7-10</a>). The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus as the ultimate dwelling place of God with humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/skilled_women.htm">Skilled Women</a></b><br>These were women in the Israelite community who possessed the skill and craftsmanship necessary for spinning goat hair.

It keeps the spotlight on a community working together under Moses&#8217; direction&#8212;men bringing precious metals, women providing crafted fabrics&#8212;&#8220;joined and held together by every supporting ligament&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p>- Scripture reminds us that God&#8217;s work is never a solo endeavor; each offering, large or small, is woven into one seamless plan (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the skilled women</b><p>- Not just a handful, but &#8220;all&#8221; who possessed ability stepped forward.
