Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah, is the progenitor of the Levites, a tribe set apart for religious duties. The Levites played a crucial role in the spiritual life of Israel, as they were responsible for the tabernacle and later the temple services. This genealogical record underscores the continuity of God's covenant promises through specific family lines.<p><b>Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</b><br>These three sons of Levi are the patriarchs of the Levitical clans. Each clan had distinct responsibilities in the service of the tabernacle. Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains and coverings. Kohathites, from whom Moses and Aaron descended, were tasked with the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the Ark of the Covenant. Merarites handled the structural components of the tabernacle, such as the frames and pillars. This division of labor highlights the organized and communal nature of worship in Israel, reflecting God's order and holiness.<p><b>Levi lived 137 years.</b><br>The lifespan of Levi, as recorded here, is significant in the context of the patriarchal narratives. It suggests a period of transition from the patriarchs to the formation of the tribes of Israel. The number 137 may also carry symbolic meaning, as numbers often do in biblical texts, though its specific significance is not explicitly stated. Levi's long life allowed for the establishment of a strong tribal identity and the passing down of traditions and responsibilities. This longevity is a testament to God's providence and the unfolding of His plan through generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>The third son of Jacob and Leah, Levi is the patriarch of the Levite tribe, which was set apart for religious duties in Israel.

Genealogies remind us that God&#8217;s faithfulness is trackable through families, not abstract ideas. Moses, writing this while Israel groaned under Pharaoh, cues the people to look back and remember, &#8220;The Lord knew your grandfathers by name.&#8221; The same assurance pulses later when Ezra and Nehemiah rebuild identity after exile (<a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to their records</b><p>These &#8220;records&#8221; (family rolls) show deliberate preservation of history.<p>&#8226; Accuracy: God commands exact censuses for the Levites in <a href="/numbers/3-14.htm">Numbers 3:14-17</a>, proving He values specifics.<p>&#8226; Accountability: With clear lineage, each clan would later receive defined sanctuary duties (<a href="/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1-49</a>).<p>&#8226; Continuity: When some priests couldn&#8217;t locate their papers after exile, they were sidelined (<a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>)&#8212;a sober hint that God&#8217;s order stands above sentiment.

It roots Israel&#8217;s hope in real names, real documents, distinct callings, and an exact lifespan. By spotlighting Levi&#8217;s sons and age, the verse reassures every generation that the God who counts years and records names is unwaveringly faithful to keep His covenant&#8212;down to the smallest detail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Gershon, Kohath, and Merari</span> were all born before Levi went into Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-8.htm" title="And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.">Genesis 46:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-11.htm" title="And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.">Genesis 46:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm" title="And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.">Genesis 46:27</a>), which was when he was about forty or fifty years of age. It is not unlikely that they were at that time all grown up. If Levi lived to be "an hundred thirty and seven years" old, he would probably before he died have seen his descendants of the fifth generation. Attempts have been made to show that the present genealogy is complete, and that Moses was Levi's great-grandson. But in Joshua's case there were ten generations (at least) between him and Jacob (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-23.htm" title="And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.">1Chronicles 7:23-27</a>); so that three generations only between Jacob and Moses are scarcely possible. The Israelites were in the habit of constructing their genealogies by omitting some of the links, as we see plainly in the genealogy of Ezra (<a href="/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) and in St. Matthew's genealogy of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/1-8.htm" title="And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;">Matthew 1:8</a>). In this present genealogy four or five (perhaps more) names are probably omitted between Amram, the son of Kohath. and Amram, the father of Moses, as will appear if we model the genealogy of Moses upon that of Joshua. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Levi</span>.
