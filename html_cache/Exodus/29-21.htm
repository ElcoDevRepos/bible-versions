Blood represents life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and its use here underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. The altar, central to the tabernacle, is where sacrifices were made, symbolizing the meeting place between God and man. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the remission of sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and some of the anointing oil</b><br>Anointing oil in the Old Testament was used to consecrate priests, kings, and sacred objects, setting them apart for God's service. The oil represents the Holy Spirit, who empowers and sanctifies believers. The combination of blood and oil in this ritual highlights the dual aspects of cleansing from sin and empowerment for service, pointing to the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer (1 <a href="/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20, 27</a>).<p><b>and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments</b><br>Sprinkling the mixture on Aaron and his garments signifies the consecration and sanctification of the high priest. Aaron, as the first high priest, serves as a type of Christ, our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The garments, described in detail earlier in Exodus, symbolize the righteousness and holiness required to serve before God. This act of sprinkling indicates that both the person and their service are dedicated to God.<p><b>as well as on his sons and their garments</b><br>Aaron's sons, who also serve as priests, are included in this consecration, emphasizing the hereditary nature of the priesthood in Israel. This act signifies the continuation of priestly duties through generations, pointing to the eternal priesthood of Christ, who intercedes for us perpetually (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>). The garments of the sons, like Aaron's, represent the need for purity and dedication in service to God.<p><b>Then he and his garments will be consecrated</b><br>Consecration involves setting apart for a holy purpose. This phrase underscores the transformation from common to sacred, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. The consecration of Aaron and his garments signifies their readiness to serve in the tabernacle, a precursor to the believer's call to holiness and service in the New Covenant (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>as well as his sons and their garments</b><br>The inclusion of Aaron's sons in the consecration process highlights the communal and familial aspect of serving God. It reflects the biblical principle of generational faithfulness and the importance of passing down spiritual responsibilities. This also prefigures the New Testament concept of the priesthood of all believers, where each Christian is called to serve and minister (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

The anointing which is here spoken of seems to have been the only anointing received by the sons of Aaron. (See <a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm" title="And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Leviticus 8:30</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take of the blood... . and of the anointing oil.</span> Apparently, this is the only unction that the ordinary priests were to receive.
