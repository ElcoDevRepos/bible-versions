Its use here signifies a symbolic act of purification and protection. Hyssop is mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-6</a> for cleansing lepers and in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, where David asks to be cleansed with hyssop. This plant's role in the Passover foreshadows its use in the New Testament, where it is associated with the crucifixion of Jesus (<a href="/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>), symbolizing purification through His sacrifice.<p><b>Dip it into the blood in the basin</b><br>The blood in the basin comes from the Passover lamb, which is central to the Passover ritual. This act of dipping signifies the application of the sacrificial blood, which is essential for the protection of the Israelites. The blood represents life and atonement, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, where it is stated that the life of the flesh is in the blood. This prefigures the blood of Christ, the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice brings redemption and protection from spiritual death (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><b>And brush the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe</b><br>The application of blood on the doorframe serves as a sign for the Lord to pass over the house, sparing the firstborn from death. This act of marking the doorframe is a public declaration of faith and obedience to God's command. The doorframe, being the entrance to the home, symbolizes the threshold between life and death, safety and danger. This act parallels the sealing of believers with the Holy Spirit in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>), marking them as God's own.<p><b>None of you shall go out the door of his house until morning</b><br>This command emphasizes the importance of remaining under the protection of the blood. It signifies trust and obedience to God's instructions, highlighting the theme of divine protection during the night of judgment. The restriction to stay indoors until morning reflects the idea of waiting for deliverance and safety, akin to the resurrection morning when Christ's victory over death is revealed. This also connects to the concept of spiritual vigilance and readiness, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), where staying prepared is crucial for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hyssop.htm">Hyssop</a></b><br>A plant used for ritual purification in the Bible.

God chose an ordinary tool for an extraordinary purpose, highlighting that deliverance rests on His power, not human impressiveness (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Hyssop shows up whenever purification is in view. Lepers were cleansed with it (<a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4&#8211;6</a>), the red-heifer ashes included it (<a href="/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>), and David prayed, &#8220;Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>).<p>&#8226; At the cross, soldiers lifted a hyssop stalk with sour wine to Jesus&#8217; lips (<a href="/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>), tying the Passover symbol to Christ&#8217;s final sacrifice. The plant whispers, &#8220;God still cleanses through blood.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Dip it into the blood in the basin</b><p>The basin collected the lamb&#8217;s blood, and the hyssop had to be dipped.<p>&#8226; The lamb had just been killed (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>). Life was given so others could live, anticipating Christ, &#8220;the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Blood is God&#8217;s ordained means of atonement: &#8220;For the life of the flesh is in the blood&#8230; it is the blood that makes atonement&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> echoes, &#8220;Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; No substitute existed. Empty hyssop was useless; only blood applied saves (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>).

Later Jesus said, &#8220;I am the door. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The act was public. Neighbors could see which homes trusted God&#8217;s word. In the same way, believers openly identify with Christ (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The blood formed a barrier against judgment: &#8220;When I see the blood, I will pass over you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>). Peter affirms, &#8220;You were redeemed&#8230; with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>None of you shall go out the door of his house until morning</b><p>Safety demanded staying under the blood-marked doorway.<p>&#8226; The destroyer was coming (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>). Whoever stepped outside rejected God&#8217;s provision and faced certain death.<p>&#8226; The command taught perseverance&#8212;remain under God&#8217;s covering until He declares the night over (cf. <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20-21</a>). Jesus echoes the principle: &#8220;The one who endures to the end will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Inside, families waited in faith.

Hyssop points to cleansing, the basin points to sacrifice, the doorframe points to identification, and the indoor waiting points to persevering trust&#8212;each strand fulfilled perfectly in Jesus, the true Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">A bunch of hyssop.</span>--The "hyssop" (<span class= "ital">ezob</span>) of the Old Testament is probably the caper plant, called now <span class= "ital">asaf,</span> or <span class= "ital">asuf,</span> by the Arabs, which grows plentifully in the Sinaitic region (Stanley: <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine,</span> p. 21), and is well adapted for the purpose here spoken of. It was regarded as having purifying properties (<a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm" title="Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:">Leviticus 14:4</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/14-49.htm" title="And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:">Leviticus 14:49-52</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-6.htm" title="And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer.">Numbers 19:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm" title="Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.">Psalm 51:7</a>), and was therefore suitable for sprinkling the blood of expiation.<p><span class= "bld">In the bason.</span>--The word translated "bason" has another meaning also, viz., "threshold;" and this meaning was preferred in the present place both by the LXX. and by Jerome. Whichever translation we adopt, there is a difficulty in the occurrence of the article, since neither the threshold nor any bason had been mentioned previously. Perhaps Moses assumed that whenever a victim was offered, the blood had to be caught in a bason, and therefore spoke of "<span class= "ital">the</span> bason" as something familiar to his hearers in this connection. If the lamb had been sacrificed <span class= "ital">on the threshold,</span> it would scarcely have been necessary to put the blood on the lintel and doorposts also.<p><span class= "bld">None of you shall go out.</span>--Moses seems to have given this command by his own authority, without any positive Divine direction. He understood that the Atoning blood was the sole protection from the destroying angel, and that outside the portal sprinkled with it was no safety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A bunch of hyssop</span>. The hyssop was regarded as having purging or purifying qualities, and was used in the cleansing of the leper (<a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>), and of the leprous house (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 51-52), and also formed an element in the "water of separation" (<a href="/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>). It was a species of plant which grew on walls, and was generally low and insignificant (<a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>), yet which could furnish a stick or stalk of some length (<a href="/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>). It must also have been a common plant in Egypt, the wilderness, and Palestine. Two suggestions are made with respect to it. One, that it was a species of marjoram (<span class="accented">Origanum Aegyptiacum</span>, <span class="accented">or O. Syriacum</span>) common in both Egypt and Syria; the other that it was the caper plant (<span class="accented">Capparis spinosa</span>), which abounds especially in the Desert. (Stanley, <span class="accented">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 21.) It is in favour of this latter identification, that the modern Arabic name for the caper plant is <span class="accented">asaf</span> or <span class="accented">asuf</span>, which excellently represents the Hebrew <span class="accented">ezob</span>, the word uniformly rendered in our version by "hyssop" <span class="cmt_word">The blood that is in the basin</span>. The Septuagint and Vulgate render - "that is <span class="accented">on the threshold."</span> <span class="accented">Saph</span> - the word translated "basin" has the double meaning. None of you shall go out. Moses may well have given this advice on his own authority, without any Divine command. (See introductory paragraph.) He would feel that beyond the protection of the blood of the lamb, there was no assurance of safety. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;qa&#7717;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
