Gold, a precious and incorruptible metal, symbolizes purity and the glory of God. In the ancient Near East, gold was often associated with royalty and deity, underscoring the sacredness of the objects within the tabernacle. This overlaying with gold points to the heavenly reality that the tabernacle represents, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described as being made of pure gold.<p><b>the top and all the sides and horns</b><br>The comprehensive covering of the altar with gold, including the top, sides, and horns, indicates the thoroughness of God's instructions and the completeness of His provision. The horns of the altar, often associated with strength and power, were used in sacrificial rituals and symbolized refuge and salvation (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). This detail foreshadows the complete and perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and provides salvation for all who seek refuge in Him.<p><b>Then he made a molding of gold around it</b><br>The molding of gold around the altar serves both a decorative and functional purpose, enhancing the beauty and sanctity of the altar while also providing a boundary or separation. This molding can be seen as a type of the crown of thorns placed on Jesus' head, symbolizing His kingship and the suffering He endured for humanity's redemption. The molding also reflects the idea of God's protection and the boundary between the holy and the profane, as seen in the separation of the Holy of Holies from the rest of the tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the Ark of the Covenant.
