In the context of Exodus, God is establishing His covenant with the Israelites, providing them with laws and guidelines to live by. The call to "pay close attention" underscores the seriousness of these instructions, reflecting the covenantal relationship between God and His people. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where Israel is commanded to hear and obey God's words diligently. It also foreshadows Jesus' teaching in the New Testament, where He emphasizes the importance of hearing and doing the Word (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><b>You must not invoke the names of other gods;</b><br>This command reflects the monotheistic foundation of Israel's faith, distinguishing them from the polytheistic cultures surrounding them. In ancient Near Eastern societies, invoking the name of a god was an act of worship and allegiance. By prohibiting this, God is reinforcing His exclusive claim to worship and loyalty. This command is part of the broader theme of idolatry prohibition found throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). It also points to the spiritual warfare theme, where allegiance to God is paramount, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>they must not be heard on your lips.</b><br>This phrase further emphasizes the prohibition against idolatry by extending it to speech. The Israelites are to avoid even speaking the names of other gods, highlighting the importance of purity in worship and speech. This reflects the biblical principle that what comes out of the mouth reflects the heart (<a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>). The cultural context of the time involved frequent invocation of deities for blessings and protection, making this command a radical call to distinctiveness and holiness. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching on the power of the tongue and the need for speech that honors God (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and commandments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and other laws, including the instructions in <a href="/bsb/exodus/23.htm">Exodus 23</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>Refers to the deities worshiped by surrounding nations, which the Israelites were forbidden to acknowledge or worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which included laws and commandments to guide their relationship with Him and with each other.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship and allegiance.
