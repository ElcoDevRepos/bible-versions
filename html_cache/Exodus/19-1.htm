The third month, Sivan, corresponds to late May or early June in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant as it marks a period of transition from slavery to receiving the Law. The number three often symbolizes completeness and divine perfection in biblical numerology.<p><b>on the same day of the month that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt</b><br>This emphasizes the exact timing of their arrival at Sinai, linking it directly to the Exodus event. The precision underscores the importance of God's timing and plan.

It is here that God will establish His covenant with Israel, giving them the Ten Commandments. Geographically, Sinai is a rugged, mountainous region, which serves as a backdrop for the divine revelation. The wilderness represents a place of testing and preparation, a theme seen in other biblical narratives, such as Jesus' temptation in the wilderness.
