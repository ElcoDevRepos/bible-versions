Historically, the Egyptians were a powerful empire, and their military prowess was well-documented. The pursuit signifies Pharaoh's hardened heart and his refusal to acknowledge the power of the God of Israel, as seen in previous plagues. This relentless chase can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual battles believers face, where the forces of evil pursue them, yet God provides deliverance.<p><b>all Pharaoh&#8217;s horses, chariots, and horsemen</b><br>The mention of horses, chariots, and horsemen underscores the might of the Egyptian military. Chariots were the most advanced military technology of the time, symbolizing strength and speed. This detail emphasizes the overwhelming odds against the Israelites, who were on foot and unarmed. Theologically, this sets the stage for God&#8217;s miraculous intervention, demonstrating His power over even the greatest human forces. This can be seen as a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, where He triumphs over seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>and followed them into the sea</b><br>This phrase is pivotal as it sets the scene for the miraculous parting of the Red Sea. Geographically, the exact location of the crossing is debated, but it is traditionally believed to be the Red Sea or a nearby body of water. The act of following the Israelites into the sea shows the Egyptians' desperation and arrogance, ignoring the divine signs that had been shown to them. This event is a foreshadowing of baptism in Christian theology, where passing through water symbolizes leaving behind a life of bondage and entering into freedom. The crossing of the Red Sea is also referenced in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, as a type of baptism and deliverance through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>Representing the oppressive force against the Israelites, the Egyptians were led by Pharaoh and pursued the Israelites into the Red Sea.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened, leading him to pursue the Israelites even after releasing them from slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians, symbolizing deliverance and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were fleeing from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, representing faith and obedience to God's guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit.htm">The Pursuit</a></b><br>The act of the Egyptians chasing the Israelites, which sets the stage for God's miraculous deliverance and the subsequent destruction of the Egyptian forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The pursuit by the Egyptians and the subsequent events demonstrate God's ultimate control over nature and nations.

The verse invites believers today to trade fear of opposing forces for trust in the God who literally makes a way where none exists&#8212;and turns the weapons of the enemy into the scene of his downfall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23-28) <span class= "bld">The Egyptians pursued.</span>--All the Israelites having entered the bed of the sea, the pillar of the cloud, it would seem, withdrew after them, and the Egyptians, who, if they could not see, could at any rate hear the sound of the departure, began to advance, following on the track of the fugitives. What they thought concerning the miracle, or what they expected, it is difficult to say. They can scarcely have entered on the bed of the sea without knowing it. Probably they assumed that, as the bed had somehow become dry, it would continue dry long enough for their chariots and horsemen to get across. The distance may not have been so much as a mile, which they may have expected to accomplish in ten minutes; but when once they were entered, their troubles began. "The Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar . . . and troubled the host of the Egyptians" (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,">Exodus 14:24</a>). By some terrible manifestation of His presence and of His anger, proceeding from the pillar of the cloud in their front, God threw the Egyptian troops into consternation and confusion. A panic terror seized them. Some probably stopped, some fled; but there were others who persevered. Then followed a second difficulty. The progress of the chariots was obstructed. According to the present reading of the Hebrew text, the wheels parted from the axles, which would naturally bring the vehicles to a stand. According to the LXX. and a reading found in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the wheels "became entangled," as they would if they sank up to the axles in the soft ooze. Hereby the advance was rendered slow and difficult: "they drave them heavily." To the Egyptians the obstruction seemed more than could be accounted for by natural causes, and they became convinced that Jehovah was fighting for Israel and against them (<a href="/exodus/14-25.htm" title="And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.">Exodus 14:25</a>). Hereupon they turned and fled. But the flight was even harder than the advance. A confused mass of horses and chariots filled the channel--they impeded each other--could make no progress--could scarcely move. Then came the final catastrophe. At God's command, Moses once more stretched his hand over the sea, and the waters returned on either side--a north-west wind brought back those of the Bitter Lakes (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm" title="And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.">Exodus 14:10</a>), the flood tide those of the Bed Sea--and the whole of the force that had entered on the sea-bed in pursuit of the Israelites was destroyed.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">All Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span>--The chariot and cavalry force alone entered the sea, not the infantry. (Comp, <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm" title="And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.">Exodus 14:28</a> and <a href="/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1</a>.) The point is of importance as connected with the question whether the Pharaoh himself perished. If all his force entered, he could not well have stayed behind; if only a portion, he might have elected to remain with the others. Menephthah, the probable Pharaoh of the Exodus, was apt to consult his own safety. (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. iv., pp. 44-45.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-31.</span> THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EGYPTIANS. As the rearguard of the Israelite host having entered the tract from which the waters had retired, proceeded along it, and left the western end of the isthmus vacant, the pillar of the cloud seems to have followed it up and withdrawn with it. The Egyptians immediately advanced. Notwithstanding the preternatural darkness, they had become aware, perhaps by means of their ears, of the movement that was taking place, and with early dawn they were under arms and pressing on the line of the Israelite retreat. They found the channel still dry, and hastily entering it with their chariot force, they hurried forward in pursuit. The first check which they received was wholly supernatural. "The Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians" (ver. 24). Details here are wanting; but less cannot be meant, than that some strange phenomena connected with the retiring "pillar" caused a panic and threw the ranks of the army into confusion. Then followed natural impediments. The Lord "took off," or "clogged" their chariot Wheels, and made them go heavily - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the chariot wheels, not by miracle, but by the operation of God's natural laws, sank into the soft sand over which the Israelites had passed easily, having no wheeled vehicles, and the chariots were consequently dragged forward slowly and with difficulty. The double hindrance, from the confusion and the stoppage of the chariots, so discouraged the Egyptians, that after a time they resolved on beating a retreat (ver. 25). They had set out on their return, when Moses, at God's instance, stretched forth his hand once mere over the sea, and the waters on both sides began at once to return. The Egyptians saw their danger, and "fled against" the advancing tide, racing against it, as it were, and seeking to reach the shore. But in vain. The waves came on rapidly, and (in the language of ver. 28) there was not a man of all those who had entered the dry bed of the sea that was not overwhelmed and drowned in the waters. We should he wrong to press this language to the extreme letter. In graphic narrative the sacred writers uniformly employ universal expressions, where they mean to give the general fact or general result. The true meaning is, that the pursuit altogether failed. Not an Egyptian made his way alive across the strait. All that the Israelites ever saw afterwards of the army that they had so much dreaded (ver. 10) was a ghastly mass of corpses thrown up by the tide on the Asiatic shore (ver. 30). <p><span class="pc_st_rem">Exodus 14:23 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen</span>. Here, as elsewhere, the word translated "horsemen" probably means the men who rode in the chariots. Observe that the Pharaoh himself is not said to have gone in.
