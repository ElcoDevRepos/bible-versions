The marriage of Amram and Jochebed reflects the early patriarchal period's customs before the Law was given. Jochebed, being Amram's aunt, indicates the close-knit family structures of the Israelites during their time in Egypt. This union is significant as it produced two of Israel's most important leaders, Aaron and Moses. The name Jochebed means "Yahweh is glory," which may reflect the faith and hope of the Israelites during their bondage in Egypt.<p><b>and she bore him Aaron and Moses</b><br>Aaron and Moses are central figures in the narrative of the Exodus. Aaron, the elder brother, became the first high priest of Israel, establishing the Aaronic priesthood. Moses, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, is a type of Christ as a deliverer and mediator. Their births are significant in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan for Israel. The mention of their mother, Jochebed, emphasizes the importance of maternal influence and faith, as seen in her actions to save Moses from Pharaoh's decree (<a href="/exodus/2.htm">Exodus 2:1-10</a>).<p><b>Amram lived 137 years</b><br>The lifespan of Amram, 137 years, is consistent with the long lifespans recorded in the genealogies of the patriarchs. This detail underscores the continuity of God's covenant promises through the generations. The longevity of Amram's life allowed him to witness the growth of his sons and the initial stages of God's deliverance of Israel. It also reflects the historical context of the time, where such lifespans were not uncommon among the patriarchs, as seen in the genealogies of Genesis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amram.htm">Amram</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, Amram is the father of Aaron and Moses.
