Altars in ancient times were often constructed from natural materials, emphasizing that worship should not be about human craftsmanship but about obedience and reverence. This aligns with the patriarchal tradition, as seen with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who built simple altars to worship God (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:25, 35:7).<p><b>and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings</b><br>Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God (Leviticus 1). Peace offerings, on the other hand, were shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer, symbolizing fellowship with God (Leviticus 3). These offerings foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God and brought peace between God and humanity (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>your sheep and goats and cattle</b><br>These animals were common in the agrarian society of ancient Israel and were often used in sacrificial practices. The use of domesticated animals highlights the cost of worship and the principle of offering something valuable to God. This prefigures Christ, the Lamb of God, who was the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>In every place where I cause My name to be remembered</b><br>This phrase indicates that God's presence is not confined to a single location, unlike the pagan deities of the time. It anticipates the later establishment of the tabernacle and temple, where God's name would dwell (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>). Ultimately, it points to the New Covenant, where God's presence is with believers everywhere through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>).<p><b>I will come to you and bless you</b><br>God's promise to come and bless His people underscores His desire for a relationship with them. This blessing is contingent upon obedience and proper worship. It echoes the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs and is fulfilled in Christ, through whom all spiritual blessings are available to believers (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker of the command, emphasizing His desire for worship and relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the command, tasked with building altars and offering sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_of_earth.htm">Altar of Earth</a></b><br>A simple structure made from natural materials, symbolizing humility and obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings_and_peace_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings and Peace Offerings</a></b><br>Types of sacrifices representing atonement and fellowship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/places_of_remembrance.htm">Places of Remembrance</a></b><br>Locations where God chooses to reveal His presence and bless His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/simplicity_in_worship.htm">Simplicity in Worship</a></b><br>God desires genuine worship over elaborate rituals.

Ultimately, the believer&#8217;s altar is the cross; through Christ we &#8220;draw near with a sincere heart&#8221; and receive every spiritual blessing (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>;

We must understand the command here given, and that of <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm" title="And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.">Exodus 20:25</a>, as intended to forbid structures of this latter kind, which, if allowed, might have led on to idolatry.<p><span class= "bld">Thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings.</span>--Sacrifice began soon after Paradise was quitted (<a href="/context/genesis/4-3.htm" title="And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.">Genesis 4:3-4</a>), and shortly became a universal practice. Noah offered sacrifice on leaving the ark (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm" title="And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.">Genesis 8:20</a>); and in the family of Abraham the rite was an established one (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm" title="And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.">Genesis 15:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-7.htm" title="And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?">Genesis 22:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-25.htm" title="And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.">Genesis 26:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm" title="Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.">Genesis 31:54</a>, &c.). Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Ph?nicians, Greeks, Romans, Scythians, Celts, Germans, all equally regarded sacrifice as a main element of their religion; and if the Hebrews had not offered actual sacrifices during their oppression in Egypt, they had, at any rate, maintained the wish to offer them, and it was (primarily) for the purpose of sacrificing that they had quitted Egypt. The legislation assumes that they are acquainted with the difference between "burnt offerings and "peace offerings," and desirous of offering both kinds. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An altar of earth</span>. Among the nations of antiquity altars were indispensable to Divine worship, which everywhere included sacrifice. They were often provided on the spur of the occasion, and were then "constructed of earth, sods, or stones, collected upon the spot." The patriarchal altars bad probably been of this character, and it was now provided that the same usage should continue: at any rate, elaborate structures of hewn and highly ornamented stone should not be allowed, lest thus idolatry should creep in, the images engraved upon the altars becoming the objects of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings</span>. The mode in which these are introduced implies that sacrifice was already a long-standing practice. The patriarchal sacrifices are well known (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>). Jethro had recently offered sacrifice in the camp of Israel (<a href="/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). If the Israelites had not sacrificed to God during the sojourn in Egypt, at any rate they had kept up the idea of sacrifice; and it was for the purpose of offering sacrifices that Moses had demanded permission to go with all his nation into the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">I will come unto thee and I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">bless thee.</span> The promise is conditional on the observance of the command. If the altars are rightly constructed, and proper victims offered, then, in all places where he allows the erection of an altar, God will accept the sacrifices offered upon it and bless the worshippers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/20-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
