This title is significant as it highlights the presence of female leadership in the early biblical narrative. Miriam's prophetic role is further evidenced in <a href="/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>, where she is mentioned alongside Moses and Aaron as a leader of Israel. Her prophetic gift may have included receiving divine messages or leading in worship and praise.<p><b>Aaron&#8217;s sister</b><br>Miriam is identified as the sister of Aaron, which also makes her the sister of Moses. This familial connection places her within the central leadership family of the Exodus narrative. Her relationship with Aaron and Moses is significant, as it underscores the unity and shared mission of the siblings in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. This connection is also seen in <a href="/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4-8</a>, where Miriam watches over the infant Moses in the Nile.<p><b>took a tambourine in her hand</b><br>The tambourine, or timbrel, was a common percussion instrument in ancient Israel, often used in celebrations and worship. Its use here signifies a moment of joy and victory following the crossing of the Red Sea. The act of taking the tambourine suggests a spontaneous expression of praise and thanksgiving to God for the deliverance from the Egyptians. The tambourine is also associated with prophetic and celebratory contexts in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/150-4.htm">Psalm 150:4</a>.<p><b>and all the women followed her</b><br>Miriam's leadership is evident as she leads the women in worship. This communal act of following indicates a shared experience of deliverance and a collective response of gratitude. The participation of all the women highlights the inclusive nature of worship and the role of women in the spiritual life of the community. It also reflects the cultural practice of women leading in song and dance during times of celebration, as seen in <a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>.<p><b>with tambourines and dancing</b><br>The use of tambourines and dancing is a traditional expression of joy and celebration in ancient Israelite culture. This scene is reminiscent of other biblical instances where music and dance are used to celebrate God's victories, such as in <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-15</a> when David dances before the Ark of the Covenant. The combination of music and movement serves as a powerful expression of worship and acknowledgment of God's mighty acts. This joyful response can be seen as a type of the ultimate victory and celebration found in Christ's triumph over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/miriam.htm">Miriam</a></b><br>She is identified as a prophetess and the sister of Aaron and Moses.
