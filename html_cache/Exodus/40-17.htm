Its construction was commanded by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>). The tabernacle was a central element of Israelite worship and symbolized God's presence with His people. It was meticulously designed with specific materials and dimensions, reflecting the holiness and order of God. The setting up of the tabernacle marked the completion of a significant phase in Israel's journey, as it provided a tangible place for worship and sacrifice.<p><b>on the first day of the first month</b><br>This timing is significant as it aligns with the beginning of the religious calendar for the Israelites, which was established at the time of the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). The first month, known as Nisan or Abib, was a time of renewal and new beginnings, symbolizing liberation and the start of a new life for the Israelites. The setting up of the tabernacle on this day underscores the theme of new beginnings and God's faithfulness in establishing His covenant with His people.<p><b>of the second year</b><br>The reference to the second year indicates that this event took place one year after the Israelites' departure from Egypt. During this year, the Israelites received the Law at Mount Sinai, constructed the tabernacle, and organized themselves as a community under God's guidance. The completion of the tabernacle in the second year marks a transition from the initial phase of liberation to a period of establishing a structured community centered around worship and obedience to God. This timing also highlights the Israelites' journey from slavery to becoming a nation with a distinct identity and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The erection of the framework, and the stretching upon it of the fine linen and goats'-hair coverings, must have been the main difficulty. But the family of Abraham had been familiar with tent life from the time of its quitting Ur of the Chaldees to the descent into Egypt, and its location in Egypt on the borders of the desert, in close neighbourhood to various nomadic races, had kept up its familiarity with tents, their structure, and the most approved methods of pitching and striking them. Thus it is not surprisiug that the first erection was completed in less than a day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-33.</span> - <span class="accented">The actual setting up of the tabernacle</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the first day the tabernacle was reared up</span>.
