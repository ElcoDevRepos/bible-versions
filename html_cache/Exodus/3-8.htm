The "hand of the Egyptians" symbolizes oppression and bondage, reflecting the Israelites' suffering under Pharaoh's rule. This divine rescue foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who comes to save humanity from the bondage of sin. The concept of God "coming down" is a theophany, where God manifests His presence in a tangible way, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a> and <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p><b>and to bring them up out of that land</b><br>The movement "up out of that land" indicates a transition from a place of suffering to a place of promise. This upward journey is both physical and spiritual, symbolizing redemption and elevation to a higher state of existence. It parallels the Christian journey from sin to salvation, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>, where believers are transferred from the domain of darkness to the kingdom of Christ.<p><b>to a good and spacious land</b><br>The "good and spacious land" represents the abundance and freedom God promises His people. This land is not only physically ample but also spiritually fulfilling, contrasting with the cramped and oppressive conditions in Egypt. It prefigures the eternal inheritance promised to believers, as described in <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>, where a heavenly country is prepared for God's people.<p><b>a land flowing with milk and honey</b><br>This phrase describes the fertility and prosperity of the Promised Land, symbolizing divine blessing and provision. "Milk and honey" are emblematic of sustenance and sweetness, indicating a land capable of supporting life abundantly. This imagery is used throughout scripture to depict God's provision, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, and it points to the spiritual nourishment found in Christ.<p><b>the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites</b><br>These groups represent the current inhabitants of the Promised Land, highlighting the challenges Israel will face in claiming their inheritance. Each group has distinct cultural and historical backgrounds, often associated with idolatry and practices contrary to God's commands. The mention of these nations underscores the need for faith and obedience in overcoming obstacles, as seen in Joshua's conquest narratives.

That this was not understood literally, even by the Jews, appears from such passages as <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7-9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm" title="The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.">Proverbs 15:3</a>, &c.<p><span class= "bld">A good land and a large.</span>--The land promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>) well deserves this description. Besides Philistia, and Palestine on both sides of the Jordan, it included almost the whole of Syria from Galilee on the south, to Amanus, Taurus, and the Euphrates on the north and north-east. This tract of country is 450 miles long, and from sixty to a hundred and twenty miles broad. Its area is not much less than 50,000 square miles. Although some parts are unproductive, it is, on the whole, a region of great fertility, quite capable of forming the seat of a powerful empire.<p><span class= "bld">A land flowing with milk and honey.</span>--This expression, here used for the first time, was already, it is probable, a proverbial one, denoting generally, richness and fertility. (See <a href="/numbers/13-27.htm" title="And they told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.">Numbers 13:27</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am come down</span>. Another anthropomorphism, and one very common in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5, 7</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>, etc.), connected of course with the idea that God has a special dwellingplace, which is above the earth. <span class="cmt_word">To bring them up</span>. Literally correct. Palestine is at a much higher level than Egypt. (Compare <a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-2.htm">Genesis 42:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3, 4</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">A good land and a large</span>. The fertility of Palestine, though not equal to that of Egypt, was still very great. Eastward of Jordan, the soil is rich and productive, the country in places wooded with fine trees, and the herbage luxuriant. Vast tracts in the spring produce enormous crops of grain, and throughout the year pasturage of every kind is abundant. "Still the countless flocks and herds may be seen, droves of cattle moving on like troops of soldiers, descending at sunset to drink of the springs-literally, in the language of; the prophet, "rams, and lambs, and goats, and bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan (Stanley, Jewish Church, pp. 217, 218). The western region is less productive, but by careful cultivation in terraces may be made to bear excellent crops of corn, olives, and figs. Palestine proper to a modern European seems small, being about the size of Belgium, less than Holland or Hanover, and not much larger than Wales. It contains about 11,000 square miles. To an Israelite of the age of Moses such a land would appear sufficiently "large;" for it was considerably larger than the entire Delta of Egypt, whereof his nation occupied the smaller half; and it fell but little short of the entire cultivable area of the whole land of Egypt, which was the greatest and most powerful country known to him. It may be added that the land included in the covenant which God made with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>), and actually possessed by David and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>), was a "good land and a large," according even to modern notions, including (as it did) besides Palestine the whole of Syria, and thus containing an area of from 50,000 to 60,000 square miles. The phrase <span class="cmt_word">flowing with milk and honey</span>, first used here, and so common in the later books (<a href="/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-9.htm">Deuteronomy 26:9, 15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-22.htm">Jeremiah 32:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a>, etc.) was probably a proverbial expression for "a land of plenty," and not intended literally. See what the spies say, <a href="/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a> The enumeration of the nations of Palestine here made is incomplete, five only of the ten whose land was promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>) being expressly mentioned. One, however, that of the Hivites, is added. We may suppose that they had succeeded to the Kenizzites or the Kadmonites of Abraham's time. The only important omission is that of the Girgashites, who hold their place in most other enumerations (<a href="/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>, etc.), but seem to have been the least important of the "seven nations,"and are omitted in <a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5</a>.
