Gold was a common material in ancient Near Eastern cultures for items of significance and worship. The fastening of the chains indicates a secure and intentional design, reflecting the importance of the high priest's role. Gold chains were also used in other parts of the tabernacle, symbolizing the connection between the divine and the earthly.<p><b>to the two gold rings</b><br>The gold rings serve as connectors, ensuring that the breastpiece is securely attached to the ephod. Rings in biblical times often symbolized continuity and eternity, as they have no beginning or end. The use of two rings may symbolize the dual nature of the priest's role, serving both God and the people. The rings also ensure that the breastpiece remains in place, signifying the steadfastness of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>at the corners of the breastpiece</b><br>The breastpiece, also known as the breastplate of judgment, was worn by the high priest and contained the Urim and Thummim, used for divine decision-making. The corners of the breastpiece are significant as they represent the extremities, ensuring that the entire piece is held securely. This placement highlights the completeness and perfection of God's law and guidance. The breastpiece's design, with its twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel, signifies the unity and diversity of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who was appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
