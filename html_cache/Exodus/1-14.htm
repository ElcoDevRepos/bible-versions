The bitterness symbolizes the severe oppression and suffering they endured, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the trials faced by God's people. This bitterness also foreshadows the bitterness of sin and the need for deliverance, pointing to the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<p><b>in brick and mortar</b><br>The use of brick and mortar indicates the type of labor the Israelites were subjected to, which aligns with archaeological findings in Egypt showing the use of mud bricks in construction during this period. This labor was not only physically demanding but also degrading, as it was typically assigned to slaves. The mention of brick and mortar connects to the construction of store cities like Pithom and Rameses, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>, emphasizing the scale and intensity of their forced labor.<p><b>and with all kinds of work in the fields</b><br>The phrase expands the scope of their labor beyond construction to include agricultural work, which was essential for Egypt's economy. This reflects the comprehensive nature of their servitude, as they were exploited in various sectors. The agricultural labor also ties into the broader biblical narrative of toil and hardship resulting from the Fall in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, underscoring the theme of human suffering under sin.<p><b>Every service they imposed was harsh</b><br>The harshness of the service imposed on the Israelites underscores the cruelty of their Egyptian taskmasters. This harshness is a key element in the narrative, setting the stage for God's intervention and the eventual Exodus. It highlights the need for divine deliverance and justice, themes that resonate throughout Scripture. The severity of their oppression also serves as a backdrop for understanding God's compassion and the significance of His covenant with Israel, which is ultimately fulfilled in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were living in Egypt and subjected to harsh slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, under the rule of Pharaoh, who enslaved the Israelites and imposed severe labor upon them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The king of Egypt who ordered the enslavement of the Israelites due to fear of their growing numbers and potential power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were living as foreigners and where they were subjected to slavery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/labor_in_brick_and_mortar.htm">Labor in Brick and Mortar</a></b><br>The specific type of work the Israelites were forced to do, which involved making bricks and constructing buildings, symbolizing the harshness of their servitude.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_oppression.htm">The Reality of Oppression</a></b><br>The Israelites' experience in Egypt is a stark reminder of the reality of oppression and the suffering it brings.

Centuries earlier God had promised Abraham that his offspring would be strangers and enslaved (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>), and that prophecy is unfolding here in real time. Scripture often links bitterness with deep affliction (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>; <a href="/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>). Yet even in such pain God is not absent; He hears bitter cries (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-24</a>) and later sweetens bitter waters (<a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23-25</a>), hinting at His power to reverse circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With hard labor in brick and mortar</b><p>The phrase highlights forced construction projects&#8212;likely royal &#8220;store cities&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s tactic mirrors later regimes that use relentless work to break people&#8217;s spirits (<a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-18</a>). By mentioning brick and mortar, the text underscores how Israel&#8217;s servitude served Egypt&#8217;s glory, not their own welfare. Years afterward, Solomon conscripted labor for temple and palace building (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a>), but his people labored willingly for God&#8217;s house, a stark contrast to the coerced toil here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And with all kinds of work in the fields</b><p>Israel&#8217;s bondage was not limited to urban construction; they were driven into agricultural tasks as well&#8212;plowing, harvesting, irrigation&#8212;turning every sphere of daily life into drudgery. Forced field labor recalls the curse on Adam: &#8220;By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Pharaoh weaponized that curse, amplifying it to control God&#8217;s covenant people. Later, when Israel enjoys Canaan&#8217;s harvests (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-15</a>), they will remember how God rescues from slavery to grant abundant fields.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every service they imposed was harsh</b><p>The verse closes by stressing the severity: &#8220;All their labor was harsh&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>b). The Hebrew pattern of emphasis (&#8220;every&#8230;harsh&#8221;) signals extremity&#8212;no task was light, no reprieve given. <a href="/leviticus/25-43.htm">Leviticus 25:43</a> later forbids Israelites from ruling one another &#8220;with harshness,&#8221; showing God&#8217;s alternative ethic. The brutality here exposes Pharaoh&#8217;s heart (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>) and sets the stage for God&#8217;s righteous judgment (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).

Taken literally and historically, it reveals both the depth of Israel&#8217;s suffering and the faithfulness of God who had foretold and would soon end it. The verse invites us to see how human cruelty cannot thwart divine covenant; instead, it becomes the backdrop against which God&#8217;s deliverance shines all the brighter (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">In morter and in brick.</span>--It has been questioned whether the Egyptians used brick as a material for building. No doubt temples, palaces, and pyramids were ordinarily of stone; but the employment of brick for walls, fortresses, and houses, especially in the Delta, is well attested. (See the <span class= "ital">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund </span>for July, 1880, pp. 137, 139, 143, &c.) Pyramids, too, were sometimes of brick (<span class= "ital">Herod. ii.</span> 136). The manufacture of bricks by foreigners, employed (like the Israelites) as public slaves, is represented by the kings upon their monuments.<p><span class= "bld">All manner of service in the field.</span>--Josephus speaks of their being employed to dig canals (<span class= "ital">Ant. Jud. </span>ii. 9, ? 1), and there is a trace in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-10.htm" title="For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:">Deuteronomy 11:10</a> of other labours connected with irrigation having been devolved on them. Such labours, under the hot sun of Egypt, are exhausting and dangerous to health.<p><span class= "bld">And all their service . . . was with rigour.</span> Rather, <span class= "ital">besides all their other service, which they made them serve with rigour.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter and in brick</span>. While stone was the material chiefly employed by the Egyptians for their grand edifices, temples, palaces, treasuries, and the like, brick was also made use of to a large extent for inferior buildings, for tombs, dwelling-houses, walls of towns, forts, enclosures of temples, etc. There are examples of its employment in pyramids (Herod. 2:136; Vyse, 'Pyramids of Gizeh,' vol. 3. pp. 57-71); but only at a time long anterior to the nineteenth and even to the eighteenth dynasty. If the Pharaoh of the present passage was Seti I., the bricks made may have been destined in the main for that great wall which he commenced, but did not live to complete, between Pelusium and Heliopolis, which was to secure his eastern frontier (Birch, 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 125). <span class="cmt_word">All manner of labour in the field</span>. The Israelitish colony was originally employed to a large extent in tending the royal flocks and herds (<a href="/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>). At a later date many of them were engaged in agricultural operations (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a>). These, in Egypt, are in some respects light, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> preparing the land and ploughing, whence the remark of Herodotus (2:14); but in other respects exceedingly heavy. There is no country where care and labour are so constantly needed during the whole of the year. The inundation necessitates extreme watchfulness, to save cattle, to prevent the houses and the farmyards from being inundated, and the embankments from being washed away. The cultivation is continuous throughout the whole of the year; and success depends upon a system of irrigation that requires constant labour and unremitting attention. If the "labour in the field" included, as Josephus supposed (1.s.c.), the cutting of canals, their lives would indeed have been "made bitter." There is no such exhausting toil as that of working under the hot Egyptian sun, with the feet in water, in an open cutting, where there can be no shade, and scarcely a breath of air, from sunrise to sunset, as forced labourers are generally required in do.
