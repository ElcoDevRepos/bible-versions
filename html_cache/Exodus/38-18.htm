This curtain was the only way into the courtyard, prefiguring Christ as the only way to God (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The courtyard itself was a place of preparation and purification before entering the more sacred areas, reflecting the need for spiritual readiness.<p><b>was embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn,</b><br>The colors used in the embroidery are significant. Blue often represents heaven or divinity, purple signifies royalty, and scarlet symbolizes sacrifice or atonement. Together, these colors point to the divine nature, kingship, and sacrificial role of Jesus Christ. The use of these colors in the tabernacle's construction highlights the multifaceted nature of God's plan for redemption.<p><b>and finely spun linen.</b><br>Finely spun linen was a symbol of purity and righteousness. In <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, fine linen is described as the righteous acts of the saints. The use of linen in the tabernacle's construction underscores the holiness required to approach God and foreshadows the righteousness imputed to believers through Christ.<p><b>It was twenty cubits long</b><br>A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making the curtain about 30 feet long. This length ensured that the entrance was wide enough to accommodate the many Israelites who would come to offer sacrifices, symbolizing the accessibility of God's grace to all who seek Him.<p><b>and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,</b><br>The height of five cubits, or about 7.5 feet, provided a significant barrier, ensuring that the courtyard was a distinct and set-apart space.
