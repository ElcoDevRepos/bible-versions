It reflects the intimate relationship Moses had with God, often seen in Exodus where God speaks to Moses as a friend (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>). This communication underscores the seriousness of the situation, as God directly intervenes to address the sin of the people.<p><b>Go down at once</b><br>The urgency in God's command suggests the gravity of the Israelites' actions. The immediacy reflects the need for swift action to address the rebellion. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where immediate obedience is required in response to sin, such as in the story of Jonah or the call of the prophets.<p><b>for your people</b><br>Here, God refers to the Israelites as "your people," which can be seen as a test of Moses' leadership and intercessory role. It also reflects a shift in responsibility, emphasizing Moses' role as the leader who brought them out of Egypt. This phrase can be compared to instances where God distances Himself from the people due to their disobedience, as seen in the prophets.<p><b>whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus event, a foundational moment in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and God's faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship established at Sinai. The mention of Egypt also highlights the contrast between their deliverance and their current rebellion, as they have quickly forgotten God's mighty acts.<p><b>have corrupted themselves</b><br>The term "corrupted" indicates moral and spiritual decay, often associated with idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. This echoes the language used in <a href="/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> regarding the corruption of humanity before the flood. The Israelites' corruption is a direct violation of the first two commandments given at Sinai, showing their quick departure from the covenant path.

Moses, in Sinai, was so far removed from the camp, and the cloud so shut out his vision of it, that he had neither seen nor heard anything unusual, and was wholly ignorant of what had happened, until God declared it to him (ver. 7, 8). After declaring it, God announced his intention of destroying the people for their apostasy, and fulfilling his promise to Abraham by raising up a "great nation" out of the seed of Moses (ver. 10). No doubt this constituted a great trial of the prophet's character. He might, without sin, have acquiesced in the punishment of the people as deserved, and have accepted the promise made to himself as a fresh instance of God's goodness to him. There would have been nothing wrong in this; but it would have shown that he fell short of the heroic type, belonged to the ordinary run of mortals, was of the common "delf," not of "the precious porcelain of human clay." God's trial of him gave him an opportunity of rising above this; and he responded to it. From the time that he reached full manhood (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11</a>) he had cast in his lot with his nation; he had been appointed their leader (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>); they had accepted him as such (<a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>); he had led them out of Egypt and brought them to Sinai; if he had looked coldly on them now, and readily separated his fate from theirs, he would have been false to his past, and wanting in tenderness towards those who were at once his wards and his countrymen. His own glory naturally drew him one way, his affection for Israel the other. It is to his eternal honour that he chose the better part; declined to be put in Abraham's place, and generously interceded for his nation (vers. 11-13). He thereby placed himself among the heroes of humanity, and gave additional strength and dignity to his own character. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, descend</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "make haste to descend - do not tarry - there is need of thy immediate presence." <span class="cmt_word">Thy people, which thou broughtest,</span> etc. Words calculated to awaken the tenderness between which and self-love the coming struggle was to be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/32-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
