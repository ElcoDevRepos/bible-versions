This order reflects his authoritative role in guiding the construction of the Tabernacle, a central place of worship. The context here is the building of the Tabernacle, which required specific materials and craftsmanship as detailed in earlier chapters of Exodus. Moses' leadership is a type of Christ, who also gives commands to His followers.<p><b>they sent a proclamation throughout the camp</b><br>The camp refers to the encampment of the Israelites in the wilderness. This proclamation was a public announcement, indicating the organized structure and communication methods among the Israelites. The camp was a temporary dwelling place, reflecting the transient nature of their journey to the Promised Land. This mirrors the Christian journey towards eternal life, emphasizing the importance of community and obedience.<p><b>&#8220;No man or woman should make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.&#8221;</b><br>This directive highlights the overwhelming generosity of the Israelites, as they had already provided more than enough materials for the construction of the Tabernacle. It underscores the principle of giving willingly and abundantly, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul encourages cheerful giving. The sanctuary, or Tabernacle, was a precursor to the Temple and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who is the true dwelling place of God among men (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>So the people were restrained from bringing more,</b><br>The restraint indicates that the people's hearts were stirred to give beyond what was necessary, demonstrating their devotion and commitment to God's work. This act of restraint is unique in Scripture, showing a rare instance where the people's generosity exceeded the need. It serves as a reminder of God's provision and the sufficiency of His blessings, paralleling the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The order that caps the giving comes only after Moses has first encouraged openhanded generosity (<a href="/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20-29</a>).<p>- Obedience precedes blessing.
