This reflects the hierarchical structure of labor in ancient Egypt, where native overseers were often used to control foreign labor forces. The act of appealing to Pharaoh indicates a level of desperation and a belief that Pharaoh might be reasonable or unaware of the harsh conditions. This moment highlights the increasing oppression of the Israelites, setting the stage for God's deliverance. It also foreshadows the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, a recurring theme in the narrative.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you treating your servants this way?:</b><br>The term "servants" here is significant, as it reflects the Israelites' subjugated status under Egyptian rule. This question underscores the injustice and harshness of their treatment, which had escalated since Moses and Aaron's initial request to let the Israelites go. The foremen's plea is a cry for justice and fair treatment, resonating with the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the oppressed. This situation also prefigures the ultimate liberation that God will bring, contrasting human injustice with divine justice. The question posed by the foremen can be seen as a type of intercession, a role that Jesus Christ fulfills as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_foremen.htm">Israelite Foremen</a></b><br>These were the Hebrew overseers appointed by the Egyptians to manage the labor of the Israelite slaves.

They were conscious to themselves of having done their utmost, and of having failed simply because the thing required was impossible. Surely the king would understand this, if they pointed it out, and would either allow straw as before, or diminish the number of the bricks. But the king had no desire for justice, and did not even pretend to it. He asked for no particulars, ordered no inquiry into the ground of complaint; but turned upon the complainants with the cuckoo cry - "Idle, <span class="accented">idle</span> yourselves - else ye had no time to come here; go, work - go, work." Then the officers felt that they were indeed "in evil case" (ver. 19) - the king was determined not to do justice - no hope remained - they must be beaten again and again, until they died of the punishment (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came and cried</span>.
