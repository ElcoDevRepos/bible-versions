Moses is often seen as a mediator between God and the Israelites, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The LORD speaking to Moses emphasizes the personal nature of God's relationship with His chosen leaders.<p><b>I will do this very thing you have asked</b><br>Moses had requested that God's presence continue with the Israelites as they journeyed to the Promised Land. This assurance from God underscores His faithfulness and willingness to respond to the intercession of His servants. It reflects the biblical principle that God hears and answers prayers according to His will (1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>).<p><b>for you have found favor in My sight</b><br>Finding favor in God's sight is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with righteousness and obedience. This favor is not earned by human merit but is a result of God's grace. It parallels the New Testament concept of grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), showing that God's favor is a gift.<p><b>and I know you by name</b><br>This phrase signifies an intimate and personal relationship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, knowing someone's name implied a deep understanding and connection. It foreshadows the New Testament promise that believers are known by God (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>). This personal knowledge is a source of comfort and assurance for God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is speaking directly to Moses.

It is a supreme favour for God to know us <span class="accented">by name</span>. It marks "a specifically personal relation to God" (Keil).
