It reflects the ongoing relationship between God and Moses, where God provides specific instructions. This divine guidance is a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative, highlighting God's sovereignty and involvement in the deliverance of the Israelites.<p><b>Get up early in the morning</b><br>The instruction to rise early suggests urgency and importance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, early morning was a time for significant activities, often associated with new beginnings or important announcements. This timing also ensures that Moses intercepts Pharaoh at a strategic moment, possibly during his morning rituals.<p><b>and when Pharaoh goes out to the water</b><br>Pharaoh's morning routine likely included religious or ceremonial activities by the Nile, which was considered sacred in Egyptian culture. The Nile was central to Egyptian life, symbolizing fertility and sustenance. Confronting Pharaoh here challenges the Egyptian gods and underscores the power of the God of Israel over nature and other deities.<p><b>stand before him and tell him</b><br>Moses is instructed to take a bold stance, indicating confrontation and authority. This act of standing before Pharaoh signifies a direct challenge to his authority and the Egyptian gods. It also reflects the courage and obedience required of Moses as God's messenger.<p><b>that this is what the LORD says</b><br>This phrase introduces a divine proclamation, underscoring the authority and seriousness of the message. It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Bible, affirming that the words spoken are not of human origin but from God Himself.<p><b>&#8216;Let My people go</b><br>This command is central to the Exodus narrative, representing God's demand for the liberation of the Israelites. It highlights the theme of freedom and deliverance, which is foundational to the identity of Israel as God's chosen people. This demand also sets the stage for the conflict between God's will and Pharaoh's resistance.<p><b>so that they may worship Me</b><br>The purpose of the Israelites' release is not merely freedom from oppression but freedom to serve and worship God. This underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where worship and obedience are central. It also foreshadows the establishment of Israel's religious practices and the importance of worship in the life of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is orchestrating the deliverance of His people from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with confronting Pharaoh and leading the Israelites out of bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against releasing the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile_river.htm">The Nile River</a></b><br>A significant geographical and cultural landmark in Egypt, where Pharaoh is confronted by Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, enslaved in Egypt, whom God desires to free for worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>Moses' willingness to confront Pharaoh demonstrates the importance of obedience to God's directives, even in the face of opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The repeated command to let the Israelites go underscores God's ultimate authority over nations and rulers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_deliverance.htm">Purpose of Deliverance</a></b><br>The phrase "so that they may worship Me" highlights that the purpose of deliverance is not just freedom, but to enable true worship of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/persistence_in_faith.htm">Persistence in Faith</a></b><br>Moses' repeated confrontations with Pharaoh teach us the value of persistence and faithfulness in carrying out God's mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing.htm">God's Timing</a></b><br>The instruction to meet Pharaoh "early in the morning" suggests the importance of timing in God's plans and our need to be attentive to His timing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_8_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_20_God_s_power_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 8:20 demonstrate God's authority over Pharaoh and Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_20_Obedience_insights.htm">What does God's command to Moses in Exodus 8:20 reveal about obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_8_20_timing_daily.htm">How can we apply God's timing in Exodus 8:20 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_20_God_s_deliverance_links.htm">What connections exist between Exodus 8:20 and God's deliverance throughout Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_20_Trust_God_over_man.htm">How does Exodus 8:20 encourage us to trust God's plans over human power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_20_God_s_power_vs_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 8:20 demonstrate God's power over nature and Pharaoh's resistance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Exodus_8_20_plagues.htm">What historical evidence supports the plagues described in Exodus 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_harden_Pharaoh_s_heart_4.htm">Why did God harden Pharaoh's heart according to Exodus 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_bioethics.htm">What role did Egyptians play in biblical narratives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_bible's_view_on_snakes.htm">What is the biblical perspective on snakes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_evidence_supports_the_ten_plagues.htm">What evidence supports the occurrence of the Ten Plagues?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_happens_in_exodus.htm">What events occur in the biblical book of Exodus?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Exodus 8:20 Mean</div><b>Then the LORD said to Moses</b><p>&#8220;Then the LORD said to Moses,&#8221;

In the original it is called the plague of "the '<span class= "ital">ar&#162;b."</span> which is used throughout in the singular number. The LXX. translate <span class= "ital">ha-'arob</span> by "the dog-fly" (<span class= "greekheb">? ????????</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The Jewish commentators connect the word with the root 'ereb or <span class= "ital">'arab,</span> and suppose it to designate either a mixed multitude of all kinds of wild beasts (Josephus and Jonathan), or a mixture of all sorts of insects (Aquila, &c). Moderns generally agree with the LXX. that a definite species of animal--probably an insect--is meant, but doubt about the particular creature. The dog-fly, it is said <span class= "ital">(Musca canina),</span> is not a pest in houses, as the '<span class= "ital">arob</span> was (<a href="/exodus/8-21.htm" title="Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where on they are.">Exodus 8:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>), nor does it do any damage to the land (<a href="/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>). It is therefore suggested that the plague was really one of the kakerlaque, a kind of beetle, which is injurious both to the persons of men, to the furniture and fittings of houses, and to the crops in the fields. It is in favour of the kakerlaque that, like all beetles, it was sacred, and might not be destroyed, being emblematic of the sun-god, Ra, especially in his form of Khepra, or "the creator." Egyptians were obliged to submit to such a plague without attempting to diminish it, and would naturally view the infliction as a sign that the sun-god was angry with them. They would also suffer grievously in person, for the kakerlaque "inflicts very painful bites with its jaws" (Kalisch); and they would begin for the first time to suffer in their property, which neither the frogs nor the mosquitoes had damaged. The plague was thus--if one of the kakerlaque--an advance on previous plagues, and if less disgusting than some others, was far more injurious.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">Early in the morning.--</span>Comp. <a href="/exodus/7-15.htm" title="Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.">Exodus 7:15</a>; and on the early habits of an Egyptian king, see Herod. ii. 172.<p><span class= "bld">He cometh forth to the water.</span>--It is conjectured that this was on the occasion of the great autumn festival, when, after the retirement of the Nile within its banks, and the scattering of the grain upon the fresh deposit of mud, the first blades of corn began to appear. It is not improbable that Khepra, "the creator," was then especially worshipped. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-24.</span> - It has been noticed that - setting apart the last and most terrible of the plagues, which stands as it were by itself - the remainder divide themselves into three groups of three each - two in each group coming with a warning, and the third without. (See <a href="/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a>.) In other respects, no great regularity is observable. There is a general principle of increasing severity in the afflictions, but it does not obtain throughout the entire series. The first three caused annoyance, rather than actual injury, either to persons or property. Of the next three, two were upon property, one upon both property and person (<a href="/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>). Of the remaining three, two again inflicted injury on property, while one (the plague of darkness) was a mere personal annoyance. The exact character of the fourth plague depends on the proper translation of the word <span class="accented">arob. The</span> Jewish commentators connected this word with <span class="accented">Ereb and 'Arab</span>, words meaning "mingled" or "mixed;" and supposed a mixed multitude of animals - beasts, reptiles, and insects - to be meant. But the expression used throughout, which is <span class="accented">ha-'arob</span>, "the <span class="accented">arob</span>," marks very clearly a single definite species. So much was clear to the LXX., who rendered the word by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "the dog-fly," which is not the common house-fly (M<span class="accented">usca domestica</span>), but a distinct species (<span class="accented">Musca canina</span>). Flies of this kind are said to constitute a terrible affliction in Egypt (Philo, De <span class="accented">vit</span>.
