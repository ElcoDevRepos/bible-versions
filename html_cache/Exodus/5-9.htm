Pharaoh's decision to increase the workload is a tactic to suppress any thoughts of rebellion or freedom among the Israelites. Historically, the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, forced into hard labor, particularly in brick-making. This increased burden is a form of oppression meant to break their spirit. Theologically, it highlights the spiritual bondage of sin, drawing a parallel to the New Testament where Jesus offers freedom from sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>so they will be occupied</b><br>Pharaoh's strategy is to keep the Israelites so busy with their labor that they have no time to consider Moses' message or the possibility of liberation. This reflects a common tactic of oppressive regimes throughout history, where overwork is used to control and subdue populations. In a spiritual sense, it can be seen as a metaphor for how distractions and burdens in life can keep individuals from focusing on spiritual truths and God's promises.<p><b>and pay no attention to these lies.&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh dismisses Moses' message as lies, showing his disbelief in the God of Israel and his resistance to divine authority. This skepticism is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's messages are often met with disbelief or hostility by those in power. It also foreshadows the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, a key theme in the Exodus narrative. This phrase can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus is often met with disbelief and accusations of falsehood (<a href="/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48-59</a>). It underscores the spiritual battle between truth and deception, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who opposes Moses and the Israelites.

God will later answer this cruelty with real, historical plagues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; This tactic&#8212;raising pressure to crush faith&#8212;mirrors how enemies of God&#8217;s people work elsewhere: see <a href="/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10&#8211;11</a>, where extra rubble and threat of attack are aimed at halting wall builders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so they will be occupied</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s stated goal is to keep Israel &#8220;occupied.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Busyness can be a bondage in itself. By filling every waking moment with toil, Pharaoh hopes to crowd out thought of worship.<p>&#8226; Compare <a href="/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29&#8211;31</a>, where the people had just paused long enough to believe and bow low in worship. Their brief spiritual awakening alarmed Pharaoh.<p>&#8226; The Lord had commanded a three-day journey into the wilderness to hold a feast to Him (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s reaction shows he fears any margin that might let Israel obey God.<p>&#8226; The same dynamic surfaces later when Jesus warns that &#8220;the cares of this life&#8221; choke the word (<a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>; <a href="/mark/4-19.htm">Mark 4:19</a>).

The conflict is not merely social or political; it is spiritual.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a> shows the same pattern: authorities accuse the apostles of spreading falsehood while they themselves oppose God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/5-9.htm">Exodus 5:9</a> records a calculated strategy: intensify oppression, overcrowd daily life, and discredit God&#8217;s word. Pharaoh believes that harsher labor will erase hope and sever Israel&#8217;s trust in the Lord.
