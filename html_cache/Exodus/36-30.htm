The eight frames mentioned here are part of the structure's framework, specifically for the west end of the Tabernacle. The number eight in biblical numerology often signifies new beginnings or a new order, which can be seen as symbolic of the new covenant relationship between God and Israel established through the Tabernacle.<p><b>and sixteen silver bases</b><br>Silver in the Bible often symbolizes redemption and atonement. The use of silver bases for the frames underscores the foundation of the Tabernacle being rooted in redemption. Each base was made from a talent of silver, which was collected as a ransom offering from the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>). This points to the idea that the dwelling place of God among His people is founded on the principle of redemption.<p><b>two under each frame</b><br>The stability and support provided by the two bases under each frame highlight the importance of a firm foundation. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as a type of the dual nature of Christ&#8212;fully God and fully man&#8212;providing the perfect foundation for the faith of believers. Additionally, the dual bases may symbolize the two tablets of the Law, which were central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were tasked with contributing materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_attention_to_detail.htm">God's Attention to Detail</a></b><br>God is a God of order and precision.
