In the context of the Tabernacle, it highlights the sacred space where God would commune with Moses, representing His desire to dwell among His people. This meeting place is a precursor to the New Testament concept of God dwelling with humanity through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>above the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, or "atonement cover," was the lid of the Ark of the Covenant. It was made of pure gold and symbolized God's throne on earth. The mercy seat was central to the Day of Atonement rituals (Leviticus 16), where the high priest would sprinkle blood to atone for the sins of Israel, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>between the two cherubim</b><br>Cherubim are angelic beings often associated with the presence and holiness of God.

There God would meet His people, "to speak there unto them" (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm" title="This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.">Exodus 29:42</a>), either literally, as when He answered inquiries of the high priest by Urim and Thummim, or spiritually, as when He accepted incense, and the blood of offerings, and prayers, offered to Him by the people through their appointed representatives, the priests. It was for the purpose of thus "meeting" His people that the entire tabernacle was designed, and hence its ordinary name was "the Tent of Meeting," unhappily rendered in the Authorised Version by the "tabernacle of the congregation." (See Note on <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm" title="In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever to their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.">Exodus 27:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there I will meet with thee</span>. The whole of the foregoing description has been subordinate to this. In all the arrange-meats for the tabernacle God was, primarily and mainly, providing a fit place where he might manifest himself to Moses and his successors. The theocracy was to be a government by God in reality, and not in name only. There was to be constant "communing" between God and the earthly ruler of the nation, and therefore a place of communing. Compare <a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42-45</a>. The special seat of the Divine presence was to be the empty space above the mercy seat, between the two cherubim, and above the ark of the covenant. <p> CHAPTER 25:23-30 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/25-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will meet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;a&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
