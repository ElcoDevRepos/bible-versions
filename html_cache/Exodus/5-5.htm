His hardened heart is a recurring theme in Exodus, symbolizing resistance to divine authority. This phrase introduces Pharaoh's response to Moses and Aaron's request to let the Israelites go, highlighting his role as an antagonist in the narrative.<p><b>Look, the people of the land are now numerous</b><br>This acknowledges the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The Israelites' population growth in Egypt is both a blessing and a perceived threat to Pharaoh, who fears their potential to rise against him (<a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9-10</a>). This fear leads to their oppression, setting the stage for God's deliverance.<p><b>and you would be stopping them from their labor</b><br>Pharaoh's concern is economic and political. The Israelites' labor was crucial to Egypt's economy, particularly in construction projects. This phrase underscores the harsh conditions of slavery and the dehumanizing view of the Israelites as mere laborers. It also foreshadows the increasing oppression they will face, which God will ultimately use to demonstrate His power and deliverance. The theme of rest versus labor is significant, as it contrasts with God's command for a Sabbath rest, pointing to spiritual rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the oppressive power that enslaved the Israelites.
