The Israelites, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are in a period of severe oppression in Egypt. This command underscores God's intention to fulfill His covenant promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>I am the LORD:</b><br>This declaration asserts God's identity as Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God. It is a reminder of His eternal nature and His faithfulness. The use of "I am" connects to God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where He declares, "I AM WHO I AM," signifying His unchanging and self-existent nature.<p><b>and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians:</b><br>This promise of deliverance is central to the Exodus narrative. The "yoke" symbolizes the harsh slavery and oppression the Israelites faced. Historically, Egypt was a powerful empire, and the Israelites' liberation would demonstrate God's supremacy over earthly powers. This act of deliverance prefigures the spiritual liberation from sin through Christ.<p><b>and deliver you from their bondage:</b><br>The term "bondage" highlights the severity of the Israelites' suffering. This deliverance is not just physical but also spiritual, as it foreshadows the ultimate deliverance from sin and death through Jesus Christ. The Exodus becomes a foundational event in Israel's history, celebrated annually in the Passover.<p><b>I will redeem you with an outstretched arm:</b><br>Redemption here involves a powerful act of God intervening in history. The "outstretched arm" signifies God's strength and active involvement in rescuing His people. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a> and is a type of Christ's redemptive work on the cross, where He stretched out His arms to save humanity.<p><b>and with mighty acts of judgment:</b><br>These acts refer to the plagues that God would bring upon Egypt, demonstrating His power and justice. Each plague was a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, revealing the impotence of false deities. This phrase also points to the final judgment, where God's justice will be fully realized, and parallels the victory over sin achieved through Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals His power and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are enslaved in Egypt and are the recipients of God's promise of deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, representing the worldly powers and systems that enslave God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet through whom God communicates His plans for Israel's deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The pivotal event of liberation from Egyptian bondage, symbolizing God's redemptive power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, as seen in His commitment to deliver Israel.

Later on we learn that the redemption was accomplished in a twofold way--(1) by the long series of wonders, culminating in the tenth plague, whereby they were taken out of Pharaoh's hand, and ceased to be his slaves, becoming instead the servants of God; and (2) by being led through the Red Sea, and thus delivered, one and all, from impending death, and so purchased anew. (See <a href="/context/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13-16</a>.) The delivery from Pharaoh typified <span class= "ital">our</span> deliverance from the power of Satan; the bringing forth from Egypt <span class= "ital">our</span> deliverance from the power of sin.<p><span class= "bld">With a stretched out arm.</span>--See the comment on <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm" title="And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.">Exodus 3:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Witn great judgments.</span> ? That the "wonders" to be performed would also be "judgments" is here first declared plainly, though previously hinted at (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm" title="And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-23.htm" title="And I say to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.">Exodus 4:23</a>). In Genesis God had said that he would "judge" the nation which should afflict Israel (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm" title="And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.">Genesis 15:14</a>), but not that he would do so miraculously. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say unto the children of Israel</span>. God felt for the disappointment which the people had suffered in finding no alleviation of their toils, but the reverse, after their hopes had been raised high by the words of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). He therefore sent them an inspiriting and gracious message. "They <span class="accented">should</span> be rid of their bondage; they <span class="accented">should</span> be brought out; they <span class="accented">should</span> be redeemed and delivered by his mighty arm and miraculous intervention. He, Jehovah, had said it." Faith would lay hold on this assurance and cling to it, even though God still delayed his coming, and did not precipitate matters. <span class="cmt_word">A stretched-out arm</span>. Arms are stretched out by men to help and save. An outstretched arm in the Egyptian writing meant "action." The phrase, elsewhere so common, is here used for the first time. (Compare, however, <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>.) It was significant of active, energetic help. <span class="cmt_word">Great judgments</span>. These had been previously hinted at (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a> and <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>) but had not been previously called "judgments."
