Acacia wood, known for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizes the incorruptible nature of what is holy. This wood was abundant in the Sinai region, making it a practical choice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The poles were essential for transporting the Ark of the Covenant, ensuring that it was carried without being touched directly, which aligns with the holiness and reverence required in handling sacred objects (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>). The use of acacia wood can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is both fully human (wood) and divine (gold overlay).<p><b>and overlaid them with gold.</b><br>The overlay of gold on the acacia wood signifies the divine nature and glory of God. Gold, a precious and pure metal, represents the holiness and majesty of God. In the context of the Tabernacle, gold was used extensively to denote the sacredness of the space and its furnishings. This overlaying process points to the dual nature of Christ, who is both human (represented by the wood) and divine (represented by the gold). The use of gold also connects to the heavenly vision of the New Jerusalem, where gold is a prominent feature (<a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>). The poles, overlaid with gold, emphasize the importance of approaching God with reverence and the necessity of mediation, as seen in the priestly functions and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our High Priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The chief artisan appointed by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings.
