The distinction is a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative, emphasizing God's covenant relationship with Israel (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). This separation is not just physical but spiritual, as God sets apart His people for His purposes. Theologically, it foreshadows the New Testament concept of the church as a distinct people of God (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Historically, this distinction is evident in the plagues, where the Israelites in Goshen were spared from the calamities that befell the Egyptians. This separation also serves as a type of Christ, who distinguishes His followers from the world (<a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>).<p><b>This sign will take place tomorrow.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The specificity of "tomorrow" underscores God's control over time and events, demonstrating His power and authority. In the context of the plagues, it shows that these were not random occurrences but divinely orchestrated signs. The use of signs is a common biblical motif, serving as evidence of God's intervention and promises (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). This particular sign, like others in Exodus, serves to authenticate Moses' leadership and God's message to Pharaoh. It also prefigures the signs and wonders performed by Jesus, which validated His divine mission (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). The immediacy of "tomorrow" emphasizes the urgency and certainty of God's actions, reminding believers of the reliability of God's word and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is orchestrating the plagues in Egypt to demonstrate His power and to free the Israelites from slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to confront Pharaoh and lead His people out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go, despite the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are enslaved in Egypt and are the recipients of God's promise of deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and the setting for the plagues that God sends as signs of His power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God demonstrates His supreme authority over all creation by making a clear distinction between His people and the Egyptians.
