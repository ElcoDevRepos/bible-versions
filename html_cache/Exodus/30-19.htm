His sons were also designated to serve as priests. This establishes the hereditary nature of the priesthood in ancient Israel, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28 and 29</a>. The priesthood was a sacred office, and Aaron and his sons were set apart for service in the tabernacle, which was the dwelling place of God among His people. This lineage is significant as it foreshadows the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is described in the New Testament as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6</a>).<p><b>are to wash their hands and feet</b><br>The act of washing hands and feet was a ritual of purification necessary for the priests before they performed their duties in the tabernacle. This washing took place at the bronze basin, which was located in the courtyard of the tabernacle. The washing symbolized the need for purity and holiness when approaching God, emphasizing the importance of being clean from sin and defilement. This ritual underscores the broader biblical theme of cleansing and sanctification, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). The washing also has practical implications, as it ensured that the priests were physically clean before handling sacred objects and performing sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Ablution by clear fresh water is so plain and simple a type of purity as to have been used in almost all religions. The hands and the feet would designate symbolically all a man's active doings, and even his whole walk in life - his "goings out" and his "comings in," in the phraseology of the Hebrews. There would also be a special practical need for such ablutions in the case of persons who were employed about bloody sacrifices, who slew the victims, sprinkled, the blood, and even dashed it against the base of the altar. On some rare occasions the priests were required to bathe their whole persons, and not their hands and feet only (see above, ch. 29:4; and below, <a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/30-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">with which</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;men&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are to wash</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1458;&#1510;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7364.htm">Strong's 7364: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wash, wash off or away, bathe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their hands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and feet.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7713;&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7272.htm">Strong's 7272: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foot, a step, the pudenda</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/30-19.htm">OT Law: Exodus 30:19 Aaron and his sons shall wash their (Exo.
