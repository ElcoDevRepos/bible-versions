The Levites were set apart for religious duties, and Merari's descendants had specific responsibilities related to the tabernacle. Mahli and Mushi, as sons of Merari, were part of the Levitical family tasked with the care and transportation of the tabernacle's structural components, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases (<a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>). This highlights the importance of each Levitical family in maintaining the worship practices of Israel. The names Mahli and Mushi are not widely mentioned elsewhere, indicating their roles were more functional than narrative-driven. Their duties underscore the theme of service and obedience to God's commands, a recurring motif in the Old Testament.<p><b>These were the clans of the Levites according to their records.</b><br>The Levites were divided into clans based on their lineage from Levi's three sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Each clan had distinct roles in the religious life of Israel, emphasizing the organized and communal nature of worship. The mention of "records" suggests a meticulous keeping of genealogies and duties, which was crucial for maintaining the purity and order of the priestly service. This practice of record-keeping is seen throughout the Old Testament, reflecting the importance of heritage and divine order. The Levites' role as mediators between God and Israel foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends the Levitical priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/merari.htm">Merari</a></b><br>One of the three sons of Levi, Merari is the patriarch of the Merarite clan.

In the wilderness census the LORD singled out Merari&#8217;s household for specific service at the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/4-29.htm">Numbers 4:29-33</a>). By placing Merari here, Scripture underscores how carefully God traces each family, showing that every name is known and every calling is intentional&#8212;echoing earlier genealogical faithfulness in <a href="/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a> and later in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1, 19</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mahli and Mushi</b><p>Merari&#8217;s legacy narrows to two sons, Mahli and Mushi.
