This act of divine intervention is a demonstration of God's power over creation, reminiscent of the creation narrative where God separates the waters (<a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-7</a>). It signifies God's control over nature and His ability to protect His people.<p><b>and covered the chariots and horsemen</b><br>The chariots and horsemen represent the military might of ancient Egypt, one of the most powerful empires of the time. Chariots were a symbol of strength and technological advancement in warfare. The covering of these forces by the waters signifies the futility of human power against divine will. This event is a fulfillment of God's promise to fight for Israel (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>) and serves as a reminder of His sovereignty.<p><b>the entire army of Pharaoh</b><br>Pharaoh's army was a formidable force, and its destruction underscores the totality of God's deliverance. Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine or semi-divine figures, and their armies were seen as invincible. The complete defeat of Pharaoh's forces highlights the supremacy of the God of Israel over the gods of Egypt, as seen in the plagues that preceded this event (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>that had chased the Israelites into the sea</b><br>This pursuit into the sea represents Pharaoh's hardened heart and his refusal to acknowledge God's authority, despite the plagues and warnings. Theologically, it illustrates the theme of judgment against those who oppose God's plans. The pursuit also serves as a test of faith for the Israelites, who had to trust in God's deliverance despite the imminent threat.<p><b>Not one of them survived</b><br>The total annihilation of Pharaoh's army is a testament to the completeness of God's judgment and deliverance. It echoes the theme of divine justice found throughout Scripture, where God's enemies are ultimately defeated (<a href="/psalms/136-15.htm">Psalm 136:15</a>). This phrase also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who delivers His people from spiritual bondage. The complete destruction of the Egyptian forces serves as a foreshadowing of the final judgment where evil will be fully eradicated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who pursued the Israelites after initially allowing them to leave.

Every soldier who pursued God&#8217;s people meets the same end.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God had stated His purpose: &#8220;I will gain honor over Pharaoh and all his army&#8221; (14:17), echoing <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>&#8217;s note that Pharaoh was raised up for God&#8217;s glory.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-4.htm">Deuteronomy 11:4</a> later reminds Israel how the LORD &#8220;overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea,&#8221; a permanent marker of deliverance.<p>&#8226; For the Israelites, this means the oppressor&#8217;s threat is gone; there is no enemy left to drag them back to slavery (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a> echoes that spiritual reality for believers in Christ).<p>God&#8217;s salvation is thorough; He does not leave His work half-finished.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not one of them survived</b><p>Total judgment falls: &#8220;Not even one remained&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/106-11.htm">Psalm 106:11</a> reflects on this).<p>&#8226; The precision of the statement highlights God&#8217;s justice&#8212;each man opposed to His plan receives the consequence, yet not a single Israelite is harmed (14:29).<p>&#8226; It points forward to final judgment scenes such as <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11&#8211;21</a>, where rebellion is decisively ended.<p>&#8226; It also reassures believers that the LORD deals completely with the forces that enslave&#8212;sin&#8217;s dominion is broken (<a href="/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>).<p>There are no half-measures with God&#8217;s redemption or His judgment; both are absolute.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a> paints the climactic moment when God seals His people&#8217;s rescue and crushes their enemies.

The verse assures us that the Lord who opens the way also closes it behind His children, eliminating every threat. His deliverance is complete, His victory total, and His Word&#8212;then and now&#8212;utterly trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">The chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host . . . --</span>This translation is misleading. The Heb. runs thus: "The chariots and the horsemen (who were) all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea." It is implied that his footmen did not enter the sea.<p><span class= "bld">There remained not so much as one of them.</span>--The armour of an Egyptian warrior would make it impossible for him to escape by swimming from such a catastrophe. All who were caught by the tide would certainly be drowned. The question whether the Pharaon was drowned or no cannot be ruled by the expression here used, nor by any parallel one in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/78-53.htm" title="And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.">Psalm 78:53</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-11.htm" title="And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.">Psalm 106:11</a>); it depends on more general considerations. In the first place, is it likely that if the Pharaoh had been killed there would have been no explicit mention of it? Would the point have remained one open to question? Secondly, if the Pharaoh had been killed, would the Egyptian annals have retained no trace of it? Must we not have had some account of a great king cut off in the flower of his age, after a reign of two, or at the most three, years? (Comp. <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the bondage.">Exodus 2:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-19.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought your life.">Exodus 4:19</a>, &c.) But Menephthah, to whom all the indications point, reigned at least eight years. The latter part of his reign was inglorious, and he left the empire a prey to pretenders; but he was not suddenly cut off after reigning a year or two. Thirdly, was an Egyptian king sure to lead an attack, and place himself in the position of most peril? This has been asserted, and it is so far true, that <span class= "ital">most </span>Egyptian kings, according to the records which they have left of themselves, so acted. But it happens that Menephthah records it of himself that on one great occasion, at any rate, he kept himself out of danger. His country was invaded by a vast army of Libyans and others from the northwest in the fifth year of his reign; the assailants menaced his chief cities, and the peril was great. Menephthah collected all his forces to meet the danger, but declined to lead them out in person, pretending that one of the Egyptian gods, Phthah, had forbidden him to quit Memphis (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">History of Egypt, </span>vol. ii., p. 119). It is thus quite probable that he would remain with the reserve of footmen when the chariots and horsemen entered the bed of the sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chariots and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh</span>. Rather "The chariots, and the chariot men of all the host of Pharaoh." So Knobel correctly. Kalisch thinks - "We are not permitted to suppose that only the Egyptian chariots pursued the Israelites into the sea, while the infantry remained behind, so that the former alone were devoured by the waves." But even he admits that "both in this and in the following chapter, and in most other parts generally, the destruction of the chariots (chariot force?) and its warriors is chiefly alluded to, so <span class="accented">that this particular stress would perhaps justify that conclusion</span>." What is clear is, that no force but the chariot force is <span class="accented">said</span> to have entered the bed of the sea in pursuit of Israel. There remained not so much as one of them. On the proper understanding of this statement, see the introductory paragraph to the chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/14-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The waters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
