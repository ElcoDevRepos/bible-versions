In the context of the tabernacle, they symbolize the divine presence and serve as guardians of the sacred space. The use of hammered gold indicates the skill and artistry involved, reflecting the importance and sanctity of the objects within the Holy of Holies. Gold, a precious metal, signifies purity and divinity, underscoring the holiness of the cherubim and their role in the tabernacle. The cherubim's presence on the Ark of the Covenant connects to their role in Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the vision of God's throne in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>, emphasizing their function as protectors and attendants of God's throne.<p><b>at the ends of the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, or "atonement cover," is the lid of the Ark of the Covenant, where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14-15</a>). This act symbolized the atonement of the people's sins and God's mercy in forgiving them. The placement of the cherubim at the ends of the mercy seat signifies their role as witnesses to God's covenant and His merciful interaction with Israel. The mercy seat itself is a type of Christ, who is our propitiation (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), highlighting the ultimate fulfillment of atonement through Jesus' sacrifice. The positioning of the cherubim also reflects the heavenly throne room imagery found in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, where living creatures surround God's throne, emphasizing the continuity of God's presence and the worship He receives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the Ark of the Covenant and the mercy seat with the cherubim.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings depicted in the Bible as guardians of sacred spaces.

His skilled hands are carrying out the exact pattern God gave Moses on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>).<p>- Obedience is central: &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). The verse shows faithful action, not guesswork. Every detail mirrors a heavenly reality (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two cherubim</b><p>- Cherubim are powerful heavenly beings who guard God&#8217;s presence, first seen when the Lord &#8220;placed cherubim&#8230; to guard the way to the tree of life&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>).<p>- God is &#8220;enthroned between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>).
