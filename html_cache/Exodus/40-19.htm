The "tent" signifies the outer layer, which was made of fine linen and other materials as described in earlier chapters. The tabernacle itself was a central element in Israelite worship, symbolizing God's presence with His people. The act of spreading the tent over the tabernacle signifies the final step in setting up this sacred space, emphasizing the importance of following divine instructions precisely.<p><b>and put the covering over the tent</b><br>The covering mentioned here consisted of multiple layers, including ram skins dyed red and another layer of durable leather. These coverings provided protection from the elements and symbolized the holiness and separation of the tabernacle from the common world.

This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, illustrating the importance of faithfulness to God's word.
