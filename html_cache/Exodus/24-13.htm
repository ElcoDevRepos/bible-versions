This phrase highlights the close relationship between Moses and Joshua, who is described as his attendant. Joshua, who would later succeed Moses as the leader of Israel, is being prepared for leadership through his close association with Moses. This mentorship is crucial, as Joshua will eventually lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. The term "attendant" indicates Joshua's role as a servant and apprentice, learning from Moses' example. This relationship is reminiscent of other biblical mentorships, such as Elijah and Elisha. The presence of Joshua also underscores the importance of discipleship and preparation for future leadership within the biblical narrative.<p><b>and went up on the mountain of God</b><br>The "mountain of God" refers to Mount Sinai, a significant location in the biblical narrative where God reveals Himself to Moses and gives the Law. This mountain is a place of divine encounter and revelation, symbolizing the meeting point between God and humanity. The ascent of Moses and Joshua signifies a journey towards a deeper understanding and communion with God. In biblical typology, mountains often represent places of divine revelation and covenant, as seen with Abraham on Mount Moriah and Jesus' transfiguration on a high mountain. The act of going up the mountain can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual ascent and seeking God's presence. This event foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus often goes to mountains to pray and teach, emphasizing the continuity of divine revelation throughout the scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and God's chosen prophet to deliver His people from Egypt.

(<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>), showing orderly leadership while personally attending to God&#8217;s call.<p>&#8226; Similar prompt obedience appears in <a href="/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3</a>, where he &#8220;went up to God&#8221; as soon as the Lord called.<p>&#8226; This readiness prefigures Jesus&#8217; constant responsiveness to the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>), reminding us that true faith produces swift, faithful action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Joshua his attendant</b><p>&#8226; Joshua had served Moses since the victory over Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-14</a>) and is described as &#8220;a young man who did not leave the tent&#8221; where God met with Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226;
