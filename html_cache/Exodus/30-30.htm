In this context, Aaron and his sons are being set apart for the priesthood. Anointing with oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit's empowerment and presence. This practice is rooted in ancient Near Eastern customs where oil was used in religious and royal ceremonies. The anointing of Aaron and his sons marks the beginning of the Levitical priesthood, a hereditary office that would continue through their descendants. This act also prefigures the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who was anointed by the Holy Spirit at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>).<p><b>and consecrate them</b><br>Consecration involves making something or someone holy, dedicating them to God's service. This process included rituals such as washing, clothing in sacred garments, and sacrifices, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29</a>. The consecration of Aaron and his sons underscores the holiness required of those who serve in God's presence. It reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God calls His people to be set apart from the world (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). This consecration is a type of the sanctification believers undergo through Christ, who makes them a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>to serve Me as priests</b><br>The role of the priest was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers on their behalf. This priestly service was central to Israel's worship and covenant relationship with God. The priests were responsible for maintaining the tabernacle and later the temple, ensuring that the sacrificial system was carried out according to God's commands. This service points forward to Jesus Christ, who serves as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The priesthood of Aaron and his sons is a shadow of the perfect priesthood of Christ, who offers Himself as the final sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel.
