The term "lord it over" suggests a tyrannical and oppressive rule, which is consistent with Pharaoh's treatment of the Israelites as slaves. This behavior is a direct challenge to God's authority, as the Israelites are referred to as "My people," indicating God's covenant relationship with them. This echoes God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>, where He foretold the oppression of his descendants and their eventual deliverance. Pharaoh's actions are a fulfillment of this prophecy, setting the stage for God's intervention.<p><b>and do not allow them to go.</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. This stubbornness is not just a political decision but a spiritual defiance against God's command. The demand for the Israelites' release is not merely for freedom but for them to serve and worship God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual plagues that God will bring upon Egypt as a demonstration of His power and judgment. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart, mentioned throughout the Exodus account, serves as a warning against resisting God's will. This resistance is contrasted with the ultimate deliverance and redemption that God provides, which is a type of the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is obstinate and refuses to release the Israelites from slavery, despite the plagues sent by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, enslaved in Egypt, whom God intends to free.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where God demonstrates His power through the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments sent by God to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pharaoh's pride and self-exaltation lead to his downfall.
