This phrase highlights Moses' role as an intermediary between God and Pharaoh. It underscores the urgency and seriousness of the situation, as Moses is ready to act promptly upon leaving Pharaoh's presence.<p><b>I will pray to the LORD,</b><br>Moses' commitment to pray signifies his reliance on God for intervention. This reflects the biblical theme of prayer as a means of communication with God and a demonstration of faith. Moses' prayers are often depicted as powerful and effective, showing his close relationship with God.<p><b>so that tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh and his officials and his people.</b><br>The specificity of "tomorrow" indicates God's control over time and events. The swarms of flies are part of the plagues sent by God to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. This plague, like others, demonstrates God's power over nature and the gods of Egypt, as flies were associated with Egyptian deities. The mention of Pharaoh, his officials, and his people shows the widespread impact of the plagues on Egyptian society.<p><b>But Pharaoh must not act deceitfully again</b><br>This warning addresses Pharaoh's previous behavior, where he promised to let the Israelites go but reneged on his word. It highlights the theme of integrity and the consequences of deceit. Pharaoh's repeated hardening of heart is a central theme in Exodus, illustrating human resistance to God's will.<p><b>by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the LORD.</b><br>The demand for the Israelites to go and sacrifice is central to their identity and worship. Sacrifice is a key aspect of their covenant relationship with God. This request is not just about physical freedom but also about spiritual obedience and worship.
