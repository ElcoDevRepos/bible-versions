This action highlights the severity of the storm and the desperation of the sailors. It also reflects Jonah's acceptance of responsibility for his disobedience to God's command to go to Nineveh. The act of picking up Jonah signifies a turning point in the narrative, where human action intersects with divine intervention.<p><b>and cast him into the sea,</b><br>The act of casting Jonah into the sea is significant both symbolically and literally. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the sea often represented chaos and danger. By throwing Jonah into the sea, the sailors are symbolically returning him to the chaos from which he fled. This action also prefigures the concept of substitutionary atonement, where Jonah's sacrifice leads to the salvation of the sailors, paralleling the sacrifice of Christ for humanity's salvation.<p><b>and the raging sea grew calm.</b><br>The immediate calming of the sea upon Jonah's entry into the water demonstrates God's control over nature and His response to Jonah's act of submission. This miraculous event serves as a testament to God's power and mercy, affirming His sovereignty. It also draws a parallel to the New Testament account of Jesus calming the storm in the Gospels, showcasing a typology of Christ's authority over creation. The calming of the sea leads the sailors to fear the Lord and offer sacrifices, indicating a transformation in their understanding of the divine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was called to deliver a message to Nineveh but initially fled from God's command.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sailors.htm">Sailors</a></b><br>The crew on the ship bound for Tarshish, who were caught in a storm due to Jonah's disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Represents the natural world under God's control, which becomes calm after Jonah is thrown overboard.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_storm.htm">The Storm</a></b><br>A divine intervention sent by God to redirect Jonah and demonstrate His power and sovereignty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tarshish.htm">Tarshish</a></b><br>The destination Jonah chose in his attempt to flee from God's presence, symbolizing disobedience and avoidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>The calming of the sea demonstrates God's ultimate control over creation.

Jonah himself had told them, &#8220;Pick me up and throw me into the sea&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/1-12.htm">Jonah 1:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Key observations:<p>&#8226; The initiative comes from Jonah&#8217;s confession of guilt; the sailors respond when they finally see no other option (compare <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19&#8211;26</a>, where sin in the camp must be dealt with decisively).<p>&#8226; Their action shows the weight of personal accountability. Jonah&#8217;s disobedience affected everyone on board (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>).<p>&#8226; They act in fear and respect for the LORD, not in anger (<a href="/jonah/1-14.htm">Jonah 1:14</a>). Their reverence echoes <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>&#8212;&#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221;&#8212;even among Gentile sailors.<p>&#8226; This moment foreshadows the greater &#8220;sign of Jonah&#8221; that Jesus cites in <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>. One man will be given over for the salvation of many.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cast him into the sea</b><p>&#8211; A dramatic picture of substitution: Jonah goes into the depths so others may live.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4&#8211;5</a> reminds us that salvation often involves an innocent substitute bearing the penalty of others.<p>&#8226; While Jonah is not sinless, his surrender prefigures Christ&#8217;s willing sacrifice (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The sea in Scripture frequently represents chaos and judgment (<a href="/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). Jonah&#8217;s plunge shows God&#8217;s judgment directed at the source of rebellion.<p>&#8226; The sailors&#8217; hands become instruments of God&#8217;s will, underscoring that even reluctant people can serve divine purposes (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment also underlines the necessity of decisive action against sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Partial measures&#8212;throwing cargo overboard (<a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>)&#8212;had failed; only complete surrender of the guilty party calms the storm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the raging sea grew calm</b><p>&#8211; Instant confirmation that God accepted the sacrifice.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a> says God &#8220;stills the roaring of the seas.&#8221; Here He does so the second Jonah hits the water, proving His absolute sovereignty.<p>&#8226; The sudden calm parallels Jesus&#8217; rebuke of the wind and waves in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>; both storms cease at God&#8217;s command, highlighting divine authority over creation.<p>&#8226; Notice the order: obedience precedes peace. Once Jonah is where God wants him, the sea returns to rest, illustrating <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>&#8212;peace follows submission to God.<p>&#8226; The sailors witness a tangible miracle, leading them to offer a sacrifice and vows to the LORD (<a href="/jonah/1-16.htm">Jonah 1:16</a>), mirroring the disciples&#8217; awe in <a href="/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a>&#8212;&#8220;What kind of man is this?

The sailors&#8217; act of throwing Jonah overboard reflects reluctant yet necessary obedience; Jonah&#8217;s descent into the sea prefigures substitutionary sacrifice; and the immediate calm confirms God&#8217;s sovereignty and mercy. Together these moments call us to trust God&#8217;s commands, deal decisively with rebellion, and rest in the peace that follows wholehearted submission to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Raging.</span>--Comp. <span class= "ital">maris ira,</span> Ovid. <span class= "ital">Met.</span> i. 330; <span class= "ital">iratum mare,</span> Hor. <span class= "ital">Epod.</span> ii.57.<p>"At whose burden<p>The angered ocean foams."<p>SHAKESPEARE: <span class= "ital">Ant. and Cleop.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - They took up, with a certain reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Ceased from her raging;</span> literally, <span class="accented">stood from its anger</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "stood from its tossing."
