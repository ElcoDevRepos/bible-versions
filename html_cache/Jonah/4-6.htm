The Hebrew word for "appointed" (&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;, manah) is used several times in Jonah, emphasizing God's sovereignty (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17, 4</a>:7, 4:8). The vine, likely a castor oil plant or gourd, symbolizes God's provision and care, contrasting with Jonah's earlier disobedience. This act of God mirrors His earlier provision of the great fish, showing His continued involvement in Jonah's life.<p><b>and it grew up to provide shade over Jonah&#8217;s head</b><br>The rapid growth of the vine underscores the miraculous nature of God's provision. In the harsh climate of the Middle East, shade is a precious commodity, highlighting God's compassion even when Jonah is in a state of anger and discontent. This act of providing shade can be seen as a parallel to God's protection and care for Israel, offering relief and comfort in times of distress.<p><b>to ease his discomfort</b><br>Jonah's discomfort is both physical and spiritual. Physically, he is exposed to the harsh sun, but spiritually, he is in turmoil over God's mercy towards Nineveh. The vine serves as a temporary relief, symbolizing how God often provides comfort even when we are in rebellion or misunderstanding His plans. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's grace being extended to the undeserving.<p><b>and Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant</b><br>Jonah's pleasure in the plant reveals his self-centeredness and lack of understanding of God's broader purposes. His joy is short-lived and tied to his immediate comfort, contrasting with his displeasure at Nineveh's repentance. This highlights the human tendency to value personal comfort over divine compassion and mission. Jonah's reaction serves as a mirror to the reader, challenging them to consider their own responses to God's actions and priorities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was initially reluctant to deliver God's message to Nineveh.

It is a large shrub, having large palmate leaves, with serrated lobes, and spikes of blossoms which produce the seed, whence the well-known medicinal oil is extracted, in small rough husks. The strongest argument in favour of this view is the proposed derivation of the Hebrew name from the Egyptian <span class= "ital">kiki,</span> and the rabbinical name for castor-oil, <span class= "ital">kiki-oil.</span><span class= "note">[22]</span> In spite of this etymological argument, Dr. Tristram says: "Practical reasons cause me to lean strongly to the rendering of our English version, gourd, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the bottle gourd (<span class= "ital">Cucurbita pepo</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In Palestine the vernacularnames are almost identical in sound, "kurah" being the gourd, "khurwah" the castor-oil tree. But the gourd is very commonly employed in Palestine for the purpose of shading arbours. Its rapid growth and large leaves render it admirably adapted for training on trellis-work . . . But the plant withers as rapidly as it shoots, and after a storm or any injury to its stem, its fruit may be seen hanging from the leafless tendrils, which so lately concealed it, a type of melancholy desolation" (<span class= "ital">Nat Hist. of the Bible,</span> p. 449).<p><span class= "note">[22] A Semitic origin for the word is rendered probable by its discovery under the form, <span class= "ital">quqanitu,</span> on a small tablet which the Babylonian king <span class= "ital">Marduk-bal-iddin</span> (Merodach-baladan) ordered to be set in a garden.

Jerome describes this as a shrub called in Syriac <span class="accented">elkeroa</span>, and common in the sandy regions of Palestine.

It is also known by the name of the <span class="accented">Palma Christi</span>, and from its seeds is expressed "castor oil." But it is very doubtful whether this is the plant intended. Certainly the <span class="accented">ricinus</span> is never used in the East as a protection against the sun, for which its straggling, open growth renders it unsuitable; while the gourd, as Mr. Tristram testifies ('Land of Israel,' p. 37), is used universally to form trellises for shading arbours and summer houses, and affords a most effectual screen. "Orientals," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 15), "never dream of training a castor-oil plant overs booth, or planting it for a shade, and they would have but small respect for any one who did. It is in no way adapted for that purpose, while thousands of arbours are covered with various creepers of the general gourd family." With this testimony it is well to be satisfied. Whatever the plant was, its growth was abnormal in the present ease, though the rapidity with which it developed was merely a quickening of its ordinary powers, in due accordance with its nature and character.
