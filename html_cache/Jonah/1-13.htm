This reflects the human tendency to rely on one's own strength rather than seeking God's will. The sailors' actions contrast with Jonah's disobedience, as they strive to save themselves and Jonah, showing a sense of responsibility and compassion. This phrase also underscores the futility of human effort against God's sovereign plans, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, which states that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.<p><b>but they could not</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the limits of human ability when confronted with divine power. Despite their best efforts, the sailors are unable to overcome the storm, illustrating the theme of human helplessness without God's intervention. This can be seen as a parallel to the futility of resisting God's will, as Jonah attempted to do by fleeing. It also serves as a reminder of God's control over nature, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>.<p><b>for the sea was raging against them more and more</b><br>The intensifying storm signifies God's active involvement and the seriousness of Jonah's disobedience. The sea, often seen as a symbol of chaos and danger in ancient Near Eastern cultures, is used by God to accomplish His purposes. This mirrors other biblical instances where God uses natural elements to fulfill His will, such as the plagues in Egypt. The increasing fury of the sea also foreshadows the eventual submission of the sailors to God's authority, as they later cry out to Him for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was commanded to go to Nineveh but attempted to flee to Tarshish instead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sailors.htm">The Sailors</a></b><br>The men on the ship with Jonah, who were initially unaware of Jonah's disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Represents the natural world under God's control, which He uses to accomplish His purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ship.htm">The Ship</a></b><br>The vessel Jonah used in his attempt to escape God's command.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_storm.htm">The Storm</a></b><br>A divine intervention by God to redirect Jonah and demonstrate His sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/human_effort_vs._divine_will.htm">Human Effort vs. Divine Will</a></b><br>Despite the sailors' best efforts, they could not overcome the storm.
