It acknowledges that they do not presume upon God's mercy but hope for it. This attitude is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals or groups express hope in God's mercy without presumption, such as in <a href="/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>, where the prophet calls for repentance with the hope that God may relent.<p><b>God may turn and relent;</b><br>The concept of God "turning" and "relenting" is significant in the Hebrew Bible. It suggests a change in God's intended course of action in response to human repentance. This is not a change in God's character but a response to the change in human behavior. The Hebrew word for "relent" can also mean to have compassion. This reflects God's nature as compassionate and merciful, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God describes Himself as "compassionate and gracious."<p><b>He may turn from His fierce anger,</b><br>The phrase "fierce anger" underscores the seriousness of Nineveh's sin and the impending judgment. God's anger is often depicted in the Bible as a response to sin and injustice. However, the possibility of God turning from His anger highlights His willingness to forgive and restore. This is consistent with passages like <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, where God expresses no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live.<p><b>so that we will not perish.&#8221;</b><br>The concern for perishing reflects the awareness of the consequences of sin, which is death and destruction. The Ninevites' desire to avoid perishing aligns with the biblical theme of salvation and deliverance. This echoes the message of <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where belief in God's provision leads to eternal life rather than perishing. The hope for deliverance from perishing is a central theme in the narrative of redemption throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was initially reluctant to deliver God's message to Nineveh but eventually obeyed after being swallowed by a great fish.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of Assyria, known for its wickedness.

In <a href="/2_samuel/12-22.htm">2 Samuel 12:22</a> David says, &#8220;Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me,&#8221; and in <a href="/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a> the prophet urges the people, &#8220;Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave a blessing behind Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The words remind us that God is sovereign; our part is to repent and call on Him, leaving the outcome in His hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God may turn and relent;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Relent&#8221; does not imply God changes His character. Rather, when people change their behavior, He consistently responds according to His stated principles of justice and mercy (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Examples are plentiful: after Moses&#8217; intercession, &#8220;the LORD relented from the calamity&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>). In <a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a> the prophet himself testifies, &#8220;You are a gracious and compassionate God&#8230;One who relents from sending disaster.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Ninevites trust that God&#8217;s unchanging compassion will now operate toward them as they turn from sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He may turn from His fierce anger,</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s anger is righteous, directed against wickedness.
