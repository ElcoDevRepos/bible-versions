In the Bible, the rising sun often symbolizes new beginnings or divine intervention. Here, it marks the beginning of a lesson God is about to teach Jonah. The timing emphasizes the relentless nature of God's pursuit of Jonah's heart, as the new day brings new challenges.<p><b>God appointed a scorching east wind</b><br>The east wind, often referred to as the "sirocco" or "sirocco wind," is a hot, dry wind that comes from the desert regions. In biblical times, such winds were known for their intensity and could cause great discomfort. This wind is a divine appointment, showing God's control over nature and His intention to use it for His purposes. Similar divine appointments are seen in the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>) and the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<p><b>and the sun beat down on Jonah&#8217;s head</b><br>The sun's intense heat adds to Jonah's physical discomfort, symbolizing the spiritual and emotional turmoil he is experiencing. This imagery is reminiscent of the trials faced by the Israelites in the wilderness, where the harsh conditions tested their faith and reliance on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p><b>so that he grew faint</b><br>Jonah's physical weakness mirrors his spiritual state. His faintness is a result of both the external conditions and his internal struggle with God's mercy towards Nineveh. This reflects the human tendency to resist God's will when it conflicts with personal desires or prejudices.<p><b>and wished to die</b><br>Jonah's desire for death highlights his despair and inability to reconcile God's compassion with his own expectations. This echoes Elijah's similar wish in <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>, where he also felt overwhelmed by circumstances. Both instances show prophets struggling with their roles and God's plans.<p><b>saying, &#8220;It is better for me to die than to live.&#8221;</b><br>Jonah's statement reveals his deep-seated anger and frustration. It underscores the theme of God's mercy versus human judgment. Jonah's perspective contrasts with Paul's declaration in <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21</a>, where living is seen as an opportunity to serve Christ. Jonah's struggle serves as a reminder of the need to align personal desires with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was sent to Nineveh to proclaim its impending destruction due to its wickedness.

The word translated "vehement" is also rendered "silent," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sultry. Pusey and Hitzig rather incline to think it may mean the autumn or harvest wind. Either interpretation is suitable, as, according to Dr. Thomson, there are two kinds of sirocco, equally destructive and annoying - the violent wind, which fills the air with dust and sand; and the quiet one, when scarcely any air is stirring, but the heat is most overpowering ('The Land and the Book,' p. 536, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Beat upon the head</span>. The same word for the effect of the rays of the sun as in <a href="/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a> and elsewhere. Trochon quotes Ovid, 'Metam ,' 7:804 - <p><span class="accented">"Sole fere radiis feriente cacumiua primis."</span> <p><span class="accented">"The sun with earliest rays<br />Scarce smiting highest peaks."</span> Rich, 'Koordistan,' 1:125, "Just as the moon rose, about ten, an intolerable puff of wind came from the northeast. All were immediately silent, as if they had felt an earthquake, and then exclaimed, in a dismal tone, 'The sherki is come.' This was indeed the so much-dreaded sherki, and it has continued blowing ever since with great violence from the east and northeast, the wind being heated like our Bagdad sauna, but I think softer and more relaxing. This wind is the terror of these parts." "Few European travellers," says Layard ('Nin. and Babyl.,' p. 366), "can brave the perpendicular rays of an Assyrian sun. Even the well seasoned Arab seeks the shade during the day, and journeys by night unless driven forth by necessity or the love of war" (quoted by Dr. Pusey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). He fainted (see note on Amos 8:13, where the fame word is used of the effects of thirst: comp. <a href="/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a>). His position on the east of the city (ver. 5) exposed him to the full force of the scorching sun and wind. <span class="cmt_word">Wished in himself to die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">asked for his soul to die</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "despaired of his life" (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>). The expression implies that he asked God to grant him his life to do with it what he liked. In his self-will and impatience he still shows his dependence upon God. He may have had in his mind the precedent of his great master Elijah, though his spirit is very different (see note on ver. 3 above). <span class="cmt_word">Better for me to die</span>. His wish for death arose from his now assured conviction that God's mercy was extended to the heathen. He argued from the sudden withering of the gourd that he was not to stay there and see the accomplishment of his wishes, and, in his impatience and intolerance, he would rather die than behold Nineveh converted and saved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jonah/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As the sun</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;e&#183;me&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
