Nineveh was known for its size and influence, as well as its wickedness, which is why God initially sent Jonah to prophesy against it. The rhetorical question emphasizes God's mercy and willingness to forgive, contrasting with Jonah's reluctance. Nineveh's significance is underscored by its mention in other biblical texts, such as Nahum, which also addresses its eventual downfall. The city's archaeological remains, including the famous walls and palaces, attest to its historical grandeur.<p><b>which has more than 120,000 people</b><br>The mention of 120,000 people indicates the large population of Nineveh, emphasizing the scale of God's concern. This number may refer to the entire population or specifically to those who are spiritually ignorant, as suggested by the following phrase. The size of the population underscores the potential for widespread repentance and transformation, aligning with God's desire for all to come to repentance, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>.<p><b>who cannot tell their right hand from their left</b><br>This phrase is often interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual ignorance or moral confusion. It suggests that the people of Nineveh lack discernment between right and wrong, highlighting their need for divine guidance and mercy. This condition is reminiscent of other biblical instances where people are described as lost or lacking understanding, such as in <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>. The phrase underscores God's compassion for those who are spiritually blind, paralleling Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>and many cattle as well?</b><br>The inclusion of cattle emphasizes the extent of God's care for all creation, not just humans. This reflects the biblical theme of God's concern for animals, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a> and <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>. The mention of cattle also serves to highlight the economic and agricultural importance of Nineveh, further illustrating the potential impact of its destruction.

Thou hast compassion for a plant of little worth, in whose growth thou hast had no concern, to which thou hast no right; should I not pity a great city which is mine, which I have permitted to grow into power? Thou hast compassion on a flower which sprang up in a day and withered in a day; should I not pity this town with its teeming population and its multitude of cattle, the least of which is more worth than any senseless plant, and which I uphold daily with my providence? <span class="cmt_word">Six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> children of tender years, who did not know which hand was the strongest and fittest for use; or, metaphorically, who had no knowledge between good and evil" (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>), at present incapable of moral discernment. This limitation would include children of three or four years old; and, taking these as one-fifth of the population, we should set the inhabitants at six hundred thousand in number. The multitude of these innocent children, who must needs perish if the city were destroyed, is an additional reason why it should be spared. A still further claim for compassion is appended. <span class="cmt_word">And also much cattle.</span> God's mercy is over all his works; he preserveth man and beast (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>), and as man is superior to other animals, so are cattle better than plants. The book ends abruptly, but its object is accomplished. Jonah is silenced; he can make no reply; he can only confess that he is entirely wrong, and that God is righteous. He learns the lesson that God would have all men saved, and that that narrow-mindedness which would exclude heathen from his kingdom is displeasing to him and alien from his design. "For thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men in order that they should repent. For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing that thou hast made; for never wouldst thou have made anything if thou hadst hated it But thou sparest all; for they are thine, O Lord, thou Lover of souls" (Wisd. 11:23, etc.). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jonah/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So should I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
