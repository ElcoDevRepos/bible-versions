In the context of Jonah, the people of Nineveh demonstrated genuine repentance through fasting and wearing sackcloth (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). This aligns with biblical principles found in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear from heaven and heal the land if His people humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways. The actions of the Ninevites serve as a model of repentance that is not merely verbal but is demonstrated through tangible actions.<p><b>that they had turned from their evil ways</b><br>The turning from evil ways signifies repentance, a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. The Hebrew word for repentance, "teshuvah," implies a complete turning away from sin and returning to God. This is echoed in the New Testament with the Greek word "metanoia," meaning a change of mind and heart. The Ninevites' repentance is significant because it shows that even a pagan city can respond to God's call, emphasizing God's mercy and desire for all to come to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><b>He relented from the disaster</b><br>God's relenting from disaster demonstrates His mercy and compassion. This is consistent with His character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." The concept of God relenting is also seen in <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>, where God states that if a nation turns from its evil, He will relent concerning the calamity He planned to bring. This shows that God's judgments are not arbitrary but are contingent upon human response.<p><b>He had threatened to bring upon them</b><br>The threat of disaster was a warning intended to lead to repentance. In the prophetic tradition, warnings of judgment often serve as calls to repentance, as seen in the ministries of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The fact that God threatened disaster but did not carry it out upon their repentance underscores His justice and mercy. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance from judgment through Jesus Christ, who bore the penalty for sin, offering salvation to all who repent and believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who is compassionate and merciful, willing to relent from sending calamity when people repent.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/ninevites.htm">Ninevites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Nineveh, a great city known for its wickedness, who responded to Jonah's message with repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who initially resisted God's call to preach to Nineveh but eventually obeyed and delivered God's message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of Assyria, known for its size and wickedness, which repented at Jonah's preaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning away from sin and evil, demonstrated by the Ninevites in response to Jonah's warning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy_and_compassion.htm">God's Mercy and Compassion</a></b><br>God is willing to forgive and show mercy when people genuinely repent.

There is no notice in the inscriptions of this "repentance," or of any change in the polytheistic worship of the Ninevites. But the existing records of this period are singularly meagre, and show a state of calamity and depression, of internal commotions and famine. Nor is it usual in the monumental history to find mention of any events but wars and the execution of material works; moral reformations are not recorded. <span class="cmt_word">God repented of the evil</span> (<a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>). This is an anthropopathical mode of speaking; God acted as if, taking man's view of the transaction, he repented. The sentence was conditional, as Jonah well knew (<a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), in accordance with the great principle laid down in <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7</a>, etc., viz. that if a nation against which sentence is pronounced turn from its evil way, the sentence shall not be executed. God does not change, but he threatens that man may change (see note on Amos 7:3; and observe the same principle applied to individuals, <a href="/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8, 13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He did it not.</span> The evil day was postponed. This partial repentance, though it was not permanent and made little lasting impression on the national life, showed that there was some element of good in these Assyrians, and that they were not yet ripe for destruction. It has been considered to be a proof of the unhistorical character of the Book of Jonah that no mention of any of the incidents is made in the Books of Kings and Chronicles; but there is nothing strange in this. Those records never touch external politics except as closely connected with Israel's fortunes; and, derived as they were from national annals, it would have been unnatural for them to have narrated events happening so far away, and not likely to be introduced in the documents on which their history was founded. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jonah/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
