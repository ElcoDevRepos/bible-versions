Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its wickedness and brutality. The belief in God here signifies a recognition of His authority and power, a remarkable shift for a pagan city. This belief is not just intellectual assent but involves a deep conviction leading to action. The Ninevites' response can be seen as a fulfillment of God's desire for repentance, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, where God expresses no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live. This moment also prefigures the universal call to repentance found in the New Testament, where salvation is extended beyond Israel to all nations.<p><b>They proclaimed a fast</b><br>Fasting in the ancient Near East was a common expression of mourning, repentance, and humility before a deity. By proclaiming a fast, the Ninevites demonstrate their earnestness in seeking forgiveness and averting the impending judgment. This act of fasting is a communal response, indicating a collective acknowledgment of sin and a desire for change. In the Bible, fasting is often associated with seeking God's favor, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>, where the people are called to return to God with fasting, weeping, and mourning.<p><b>and dressed in sackcloth,</b><br>Sackcloth, a coarse material usually made from goat's hair, was traditionally worn as a sign of mourning and penitence. The wearing of sackcloth by the Ninevites symbolizes their humility and contrition before God. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, where Jacob mourns for Joseph, and in <a href="/esther/4.htm">Esther 4:1</a>, where Mordecai dons sackcloth in response to the edict against the Jews. The use of sackcloth underscores the sincerity of the Ninevites' repentance.<p><b>from the greatest of them to the least.</b><br>The phrase indicates that the response to Jonah's message was universal across all social strata in Nineveh. This inclusivity highlights the comprehensive nature of their repentance, with everyone from the king to the common people participating. It reflects the biblical principle that all are equal before God, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus. The collective repentance of Nineveh serves as a powerful example of how a community can turn from sin and seek God's mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was initially reluctant to deliver God's message to Nineveh but eventually obeyed after being swallowed by a great fish.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of Assyria, known for its wickedness and idolatry.

Jonah&#8217;s eight&#8211;word sermon (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>) meets hearts ready to take God at His word.<p>&#8226; This belief is more than mental agreement; it is trust that God&#8217;s warning is true and that His mercy is possible (see <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later confirms their faith was genuine: &#8220;The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-32.htm">Luke 11:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the contrast with Israel, who often heard prophets yet remained unmoved (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25&#8211;26</a>). Nineveh&#8217;s immediate belief highlights how God can pierce even the hardest culture when His word is received literally and obediently.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They proclaimed a fast</b><p>Belief quickly turns into action. Fasting signals earnest repentance and dependence on God.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, fasting underscores humility and urgency (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By making the fast public, the city leaders align civic life with spiritual need, much like Jehoshaphat who &#8220;proclaimed a fast for all Judah&#8221; when danger loomed (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their decree recognizes that human strength cannot avert divine judgment; only God&#8217;s mercy can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And dressed in sackcloth</b><p>Sackcloth&#8212;coarse, uncomfortable fabric&#8212;visibly demonstrates inward sorrow.<p>&#8226; Wearing it shows grief over sin, not just grief over consequences (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Outward symbols matter when they match inward reality; God had rejected empty displays in Israel (<a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>). Nineveh&#8217;s sackcloth is paired with true contrition.<p>&#8226; The change of clothes underlines a change of heart&#8212;shedding status, comfort, and pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the greatest of them to the least</b><p>Repentance sweeps through every social layer.<p>&#8226; Leaders do not hide behind position; commoners are not excluded.

The verse shows that when God speaks, genuine belief produces visible repentance, crossing every social boundary. Nineveh&#8217;s wholehearted response reminds us that God honors humble faith, and He still turns threatened judgment into mercy when people take Him at His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Believed God.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">believed in God.</span> Notice again an implied contrast to the dulness of the Jews, who were "slow to believe" the prophetic warnings addressed to themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Proclaimed a fast.</span>--Apparently on a spontaneous resolution of the people themselves.

This great result has seemed to some incredible, and has occasioned doubts to be east upon the history. But, as we have seen in the Introduction, Jonah's mission occurred probably at a time of national depression, when men's minds were disposed to expect calamity, and anxious to avert it by any means. Other considerations led to the same result. They had heard much of the God of the Hebrews, much of the doings of his great prophets Elijah and Elisha; and now they had in their midst one of these holy men, who, as they were informed, had been miraculously preserved from death in order to carry his message to them; for that it was thus that Jonah was "a sign unto the Ninevites" (<a href="/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a>) seems most certain. They saw the Divine inspiration beaming in his look, dictating his utterance, animating his bearing, filling him with courage, confidence, and faith. The credulity with which they received the announcements of their own seers, their national predilection for presages and omens, encouraged them to open their ears to this stranger, and to regard his mission with grave attention. Their own conscience, too, was on the prophet's side, and assisted his words with its powerful pleading. <span class="cmt_word">So they believed in God, and proclaimed a fast.</span> Spontaneously, without any special order from the authorities. Before the final fall of Nineveh, the inscriptions mention, the then king ordered a fast of one hundred days and nights to the gods in order to avert the threatened danger (see a note by Professor Sayce, in G. Smith's 'History of Babylon,' p. 156). <span class="cmt_word">Put on sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>).
