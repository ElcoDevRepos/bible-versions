In ancient maritime culture, storms were often seen as divine retribution, prompting the crew to seek answers from Jonah. This mirrors the human tendency to seek divine insight during crises, as seen in other biblical narratives like the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>&#8220;who is to blame for this calamity that is upon us?</b><br>The concept of individual responsibility for communal suffering is a recurring theme in Scripture. The sailors' question implies a belief in divine justice, where sin leads to punishment. This echoes the principle found in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where the soul that sins shall die, highlighting personal accountability.<p><b>What is your occupation,</b><br>Inquiring about Jonah's occupation may have been an attempt to discern his social status or religious role, which could provide insight into the nature of the divine displeasure. Prophets, like Jonah, held significant roles in Israelite society, often serving as intermediaries between God and the people, as seen with Elijah and Elisha.<p><b>and where have you come from?</b><br>This question seeks to uncover Jonah's origin, which could reveal cultural or religious practices that might have offended a deity. The importance of one's homeland is evident throughout the Bible, as seen in the emphasis on genealogies and tribal affiliations in books like Numbers and Chronicles.<p><b>What is your country,</b><br>The sailors' inquiry about Jonah's country reflects the ancient belief that gods were often associated with specific lands. This is similar to the story of Naaman in <a href="/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>, where the Syrian general acknowledges the God of Israel as the true God after being healed.<p><b>and who are your people?&#8221;</b><br>Understanding Jonah's ethnic and religious background could help the sailors identify the god he worships. This question underscores the importance of identity and belonging in the biblical narrative, as seen in the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites, and the emphasis on being a chosen people in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is fleeing from the Lord's command to go to Nineveh.

It is true some MSS. omit this repetition of the question, and it is therefore by some commentators treated as a gloss. But the repetition is quite natural. The sailors seeing the lot fall on one whose appearance was so little suspicious, are anxious to have it confirmed by his confession. Not less natural is the rapid and excited leap from question to question. (Comp. Virg.

Some manuscripts of the Hebrew and the Greek omit this clause as unnecessary; but, as Keil remarks, it is not superfluous, the sailors thereby wishing to induce Jonah to confess his guilt with his own mouth. In their excitement they crowd question upon question, asking him about his business, his journey, his country, his parentage.
