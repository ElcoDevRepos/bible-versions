In ancient times, sailors were often polytheistic, believing in various gods who controlled different aspects of nature. Their call to action reflects a sense of urgency and desperation in the face of the storm, which they perceive as supernatural.<p><b>&#8220;Let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity that is upon us.&#8221;</b><br>Casting lots was a common ancient practice used to discern divine will or make decisions. It involved using stones, sticks, or other objects to determine an outcome believed to be guided by a deity. This practice is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a> for the Day of Atonement and in <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a> when the apostles chose a replacement for Judas. The sailors' belief that the storm was caused by someone's wrongdoing reflects a worldview where divine retribution was expected for sin.<p><b>So they cast lots,</b><br>The act of casting lots here is significant as it shows the sailors' reliance on divine intervention to reveal hidden truths. Despite their pagan background, God uses this method to communicate His will, demonstrating His sovereignty over all creation and His ability to work through various cultural practices to achieve His purposes.<p><b>and the lot fell on Jonah.</b><br>The outcome of the lot falling on Jonah highlights God's direct involvement in the situation. It confirms Jonah's guilt and responsibility for the storm, aligning with the biblical theme of divine justice. This moment foreshadows Jonah's eventual confession and repentance. It also serves as a type of Christ, as Jonah's willingness to be sacrificed to calm the storm parallels Jesus' sacrifice for humanity's sins, bringing peace and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is fleeing from the Lord's command to go to Nineveh.

Finding all unavailing, the sailors propose recourse to the ancient custom of casting lots to discover the guilty person against whom the deities are so enraged. Classical authors as well as the Bible (comp. <a href="/joshua/7-14.htm" title="In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.">Joshua 7:14</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/14-36.htm" title="And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.

Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.">1Samuel 14:36-46</a>) afford many illustrations of the belief that the presence of an impious man would involve all who shared his company in indiscriminate ruin. Naturally the feeling expressed itself most strongly at sea.<p>"Who drags Eleusis' rite to day,<p>That man shall never share my home<p>Or join my voyage; roofs give way,<p>And boats are wrecked; true men and thieves<p>Neglected Justice oft confounds."<p>HOR.: <span class= "ital">Od. iii.</span> 2, 26-30.

Jonah doubtless had meantime complied with the captain's request, but, as the sailors saw, without visible effect. The belief that temporal calamities are often connected with the presence of culprits, and are sent in judgment, is found in classical authors.
