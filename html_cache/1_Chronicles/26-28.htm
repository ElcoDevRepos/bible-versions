His role as a seer indicates his ability to receive divine revelations. Samuel's dedication of items likely refers to offerings or spoils of war set apart for sacred use. This practice of dedicating items to God was common, reflecting a commitment to honor God with the best of what they had. Samuel's influence and spiritual leadership were foundational in establishing the monarchy in Israel.<p><b>Saul son of Kish</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, was anointed by Samuel. His reign marked the transition from a tribal confederation to a centralized monarchy. Despite his initial dedication to God, Saul's disobedience led to his downfall. The mention of his dedications suggests that, at least initially, he contributed to the religious and national life of Israel by setting apart items for God's service.<p><b>Abner son of Ner</b><br>Abner, Saul's cousin and the commander of his army, played a significant role in the early monarchy. His military leadership was crucial in establishing Saul's reign. The dedication of items by Abner indicates his involvement in religious practices, possibly as a means to seek divine favor for military endeavors. Abner's later allegiance to David highlights the complex political dynamics of the time.<p><b>and Joab son of Zeruiah</b><br>Joab, David's nephew and commander of his army, was a formidable military leader. His dedication of items reflects his participation in the religious life of Israel, despite his often ruthless actions. Joab's complex character is seen throughout David's reign, where he is both a loyal servant and a source of tension. His dedications may have been from spoils of war, emphasizing the practice of attributing military success to divine intervention.<p><b>along with everything else that was dedicated</b><br>This phrase encompasses all other items set apart for sacred use, indicating a collective effort by various leaders to honor God. The practice of dedicating items was a way to acknowledge God's sovereignty and provision. It reflects a culture where religious devotion was intertwined with national identity and leadership.<p><b>was under the care of Shelomith and his brothers</b><br>Shelomith, a Levite, and his brothers were responsible for managing these dedicated items. The Levites were tasked with duties related to the temple and worship, ensuring that sacred items were properly maintained. This responsibility underscores the importance of stewardship and the role of the Levites in preserving the spiritual heritage of Israel. The mention of Shelomith and his brothers highlights the organized structure of temple service and the communal aspect of religious life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel_the_seer.htm">Samuel the Seer</a></b><br>A prophet and judge in Israel who anointed the first two kings, Saul and David.

(Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/8-11.htm" title="Which also king David did dedicate to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;">2Samuel 8:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-18.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:18</a>). The Law, in fact, ordained the dedication of all metals to the endowment of the Sanctuary (<a href="/context/numbers/31-22.htm" title="Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,">Numbers 31:22-23</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-50.htm" title="We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.">Numbers 31:50</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-19.htm" title="But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.">Joshua 6:19</a>). These accumulations of spoil in the times preceding David help us to understand how it was that so much wealth was available for building and decorating the Temple (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/22-14.htm" title="Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.">1Chronicles 22:14-16</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - It is, perhaps, somewhat remarkable that, though the sacred history suggests to us numerous fit occasions for the "dedications" spoken of in this verse, yet they are not described in detail, nor even alluded to at the times when they occurred. Samuel, Saul, Abner, and Joab had then been unwittingly finding some of the treasures now disposed to highest use by David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Everything</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1448;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
