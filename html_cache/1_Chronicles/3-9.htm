His sons played significant roles in the history of Israel, with some becoming prominent figures in biblical narratives. The listing of David's sons in <a href="/1_chronicles/3.htm">1 Chronicles 3</a> provides a genealogical record that underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his lineage, which is central to the messianic prophecy (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>besides the sons by his concubines</b><br>Concubinage was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel. Concubines were women who had a recognized relationship with a man but held a lower status than wives. David's concubines bore him additional sons, who are not always named in the biblical text, indicating their lesser status in the royal lineage. This distinction highlights the complex family dynamics and potential for conflict, as seen in the narratives of Absalom and Adonijah, who were sons of David by different mothers.<p><b>And Tamar was their sister</b><br>Tamar, the daughter of David, is a significant figure due to the tragic events surrounding her life. Her story is detailed in <a href="/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>, where she is raped by her half-brother Amnon, leading to familial strife and Absalom's rebellion. Tamar's mention here emphasizes her importance in the narrative and the impact of her story on David's family. Her plight reflects the broader themes of justice and the consequences of sin within the royal household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, and a central figure in the lineage of Jesus Christ.

By adding, &#8220;These were all the sons of David,&#8221; he signals that the list is complete and historically reliable.<p>&#8211; Genealogies in Chronicles trace God&#8217;s covenant promises; David&#8217;s line is central because the Messiah would come through it (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The thoroughness underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness: every birth recorded here is proof that the &#8220;lamp&#8221; for David&#8217;s house kept burning (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>&#8211; Notice how the writer presents David&#8217;s family without embellishment, allowing later events (such as Solomon&#8217;s reign, <a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23-25</a>) to flow naturally from this factual base.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Besides the sons by his concubines</b><p>&#8211; Concubines were secondary wives; sons born to them were real sons, yet they ranked below the sons of full wives in royal succession (<a href="/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31</a> compared with 9:1-5).<p>&#8211; David took concubines after moving to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-13.htm">2 Samuel 5:13</a>), a practice Scripture reports but never endorses (see the caution in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>).<p>&#8211; By distinguishing these sons, the text prepares us for later tensions over succession&#8212;who will inherit the throne? (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s Word records the facts of David&#8217;s complicated household while still calling him &#8220;a man after My own heart&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>), reminding readers that grace operates even amid human weakness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Tamar was their sister</b><p>&#8211; Only one daughter is named, showing her importance. Tamar&#8217;s story&#8212;tragically abused by her half-brother Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1-22</a>)&#8212;became a turning point that fueled Absalom&#8217;s rebellion.<p>&#8211; By placing her name here, the Chronicler subtly points readers back to that painful chapter and forward to the need for righteous heirs.<p>&#8211; The mention of Tamar also testifies that every individual, not only sons, matters to God&#8217;s record. Compare the inclusion of women like Rahab and Ruth in Messianic genealogy (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Tamar&#8217;s dignity is affirmed: despite the sin committed against her, Scripture remembers her as a true daughter of David.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/3-9.htm">1 Chronicles 3:9</a> completes the catalogue of David&#8217;s children. It declares the legitimate royal sons, acknowledges additional sons by concubines, and honors Tamar by name. The verse underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant with David while honestly recording the complexities of the king&#8217;s household.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Sons of the concubines.</span>--David's concubines (<span class= "ital">pilagshim, </span><span class= "greekheb">???????</span>) are mentioned several times in Samuel (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.">2Samuel 12:11</a>), but their sons here only.

The chronicler alone gives the number of the four and nine sons, assigning the former to "Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel," and arranging the latter in three triads. <a href="/1_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="These were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.">1Chronicles 3:9</a> also is wanting in Samuel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse plainly adds <span class="cmt_word">concubines</span>, perhaps the ten spoken of in <a href="/2_samuel/15-16.htm">2 Samuel 15:16</a>, to the number of the mothers of the foregoing sons.
