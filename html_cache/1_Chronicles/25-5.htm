In the context of 1 Chronicles, Heman is one of the three chief musicians appointed by King David to lead worship in the temple. His role as a seer indicates that his musical and prophetic gifts were intertwined, serving both in the temple and in receiving divine messages. This highlights the integration of worship and prophecy in Israel's religious life. Heman's lineage is significant, as he is a descendant of the Levites, specifically from the line of Kohath, which was responsible for the sacred music and service in the tabernacle and later the temple.<p><b>were given him through the promises of God</b><br>The phrase underscores the belief in divine providence and fulfillment of God's promises. In the biblical narrative, God's promises often relate to the continuation and blessing of a family line, as seen in the covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The mention of God's promises here suggests that Heman's children were seen as a fulfillment of divine assurance, possibly reflecting the broader covenantal promises to Israel regarding prosperity and continuity.<p><b>to exalt him</b><br>This phrase indicates that the purpose of God's blessing Heman with children was to honor or elevate him. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, having many children was considered a sign of divine favor and social status. It also ensured the continuation of one's name and legacy. The exaltation of Heman through his offspring can be seen as part of God's plan to establish and maintain the worship practices in Israel, as his children would likely continue in the musical and prophetic traditions.<p><b>for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters</b><br>The specific mention of fourteen sons and three daughters emphasizes the abundance of God's blessing. In biblical numerology, the number fourteen can be seen as a double measure of completeness, as seven is often associated with perfection or completion. The inclusion of daughters alongside sons is notable, as it reflects the comprehensive nature of the blessing. This large family would have been instrumental in fulfilling the roles required for temple service, ensuring that the musical and prophetic duties were carried out by those dedicated to the Lord. The mention of both sons and daughters also highlights the inclusive nature of God's blessings, extending beyond the patriarchal norms of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heman.htm">Heman</a></b><br>A prominent figure in the Levitical musical tradition, Heman is described as the king's seer.
