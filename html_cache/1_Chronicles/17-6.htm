It recalls the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings, where God led His people with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The term "journeys" emphasizes God's active involvement and faithfulness in the lives of the Israelites, underscoring His role as a divine shepherd. This also highlights the transient nature of the Israelites' early history, living in tents and moving from place to place, which contrasts with the idea of a permanent temple.<p><b>have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people</b><br>Here, God is addressing the leaders He appointed, such as Moses, Joshua, and the judges, who were tasked with guiding and protecting the Israelites. The term "shepherd" is significant, as it conveys the idea of leadership that is caring, guiding, and protective, much like a shepherd with his flock. This imagery is consistent throughout Scripture, with leaders like David being described as shepherds (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>). It also foreshadows Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, emphasizing His role in guiding and caring for His people.<p><b>&#8216;Why haven&#8217;t you built Me a house of cedar?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights that God never demanded a permanent temple from the Israelites during their early history. The "house of cedar" refers to a temple made of luxurious materials, indicating wealth and permanence. This contrasts with the tabernacle, a portable tent that served as God's dwelling place among His people. The absence of such a demand underscores God's contentment with the tabernacle and His focus on the spiritual rather than the material. This also points to the future temple built by Solomon, which was a fulfillment of David's desire to honor God with a permanent dwelling place (1 Kings 6). Theologically, it suggests that God's presence is not confined to a physical structure, a theme echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His sovereignty and contentment with His dwelling among the Israelites without a permanent temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He led and provided for throughout their history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges_of_israel.htm">Judges of Israel</a></b><br>Leaders appointed by God to guide and govern the Israelites before the establishment of the monarchy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who desired to build a temple for God, prompting this divine response.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_cedar.htm">House of Cedar</a></b><br>A reference to a permanent, grand structure, symbolizing stability and honor, which David intended to build for God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_contentment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Contentment</a></b><br>God does not require human efforts to establish His presence;

The term "judges" would be more intelligible in later times, and has probably been substituted for the more difficult original expression. The following clause seems to refer to individual rulers, but is not really incompatible with a reference to the ascendency or hegemony of different tribes at different epochs of Israelite history. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-4.htm" title="However, the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:">1Chronicles 28:4</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/78-67.htm" title="Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:">Psalm 78:67-68</a>.)

The substitution of the Hebrew character <span class="accented">beth</span> for <span class="accented">pe</span>, in the word "judges," would make it "tribes," and bring it into harmony with the parallel place. But the succeeding clause, <span class="cmt_word">Whom I commanded to feed my people</span>, would rather suggest that the parallel place, which adds the same clause, should be brought into harmony with this (see again ver. 10 of this chapter). The general meaning and the gracious spirit underlying it is evident enough. God had never made a suggestion to tribe, or leader of tribe, nor to judge, who had been temporarily raised up to lead, and so to feed, all his people Israel, to build him an house. He had shared their lot, and had shared it unmurmuringly. He also "had not opened his mouth" (<a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12-16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3, 4</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67-71</a>). Note also the expression, "I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel" (<a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16</a>). It is to be remarked that we learn from <a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a> and 1 Chron 28:3 the fuller causes why David was not to be permitted to be the builder of the house. It is not apparent why those causes are not recited here. The same remark applies to the parallel place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
