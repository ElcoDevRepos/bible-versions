This phrase highlights the unity and collective identity of the tribe, emphasizing their familial connections. Issachar's territory was located in the fertile Jezreel Valley, which was significant for agriculture and trade. The tribe is often associated with wisdom and understanding, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>, where the men of Issachar are described as having understanding of the times.<p><b>who were mighty men of valor</b><br>This description indicates that the men of Issachar were not only numerous but also renowned for their bravery and strength. The term "mighty men of valor" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe warriors who were skilled in battle and courageous. This valor is a reflection of their role in defending their land and people, and it connects to the broader biblical theme of God empowering His people for victory, as seen in the stories of Gideon and David.<p><b>totaled 87,000</b><br>The specific number given here underscores the significant size and strength of the tribe of Issachar. In the context of ancient Israel, large numbers were often a sign of divine blessing and favor. This figure also reflects the importance of genealogical records in maintaining tribal identity and heritage. The large number may also symbolize completeness or fullness, a common biblical motif.<p><b>as listed in their genealogies</b><br>Genealogies were crucial in ancient Israel for establishing identity, inheritance rights, and tribal affiliation. They served as a record of God's faithfulness in preserving His people. The genealogical records in Chronicles emphasize continuity and the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs.
