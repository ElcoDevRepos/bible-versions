The "Three" refers to the elite group of warriors known as "The Three" or "The Three Mighty Men," who were renowned for their extraordinary feats of bravery and skill in battle. Abishai's recognition as being "doubly honored" suggests that he achieved a status of high regard and respect, possibly due to his leadership abilities and his loyalty to King David. This honor indicates a level of distinction that set him apart from others, even within this elite group. The concept of being "doubly honored" can be seen as a reflection of the biblical principle that God exalts those who are faithful and courageous, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>, where God promises to honor those who honor Him.<p><b>and he became their commander</b><br>Abishai's role as a commander signifies a position of authority and responsibility. In the context of ancient Israel, military leadership was crucial for the survival and success of the nation. Abishai's appointment as a commander over the Three suggests that he possessed not only bravery but also strategic acumen and leadership qualities. This role would have required him to lead men into battle, make critical decisions, and inspire confidence among his troops. His leadership is reminiscent of other biblical figures who were chosen by God to lead His people, such as Joshua, who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1:1-9</a>).<p><b>even though he was not included among the Three</b><br>This phrase highlights the unique position of Abishai. Although he was not one of the original Three Mighty Men, his accomplishments and character earned him a place of leadership over them. This distinction underscores the biblical theme that God often chooses individuals who may not fit the conventional mold or expectations to fulfill His purposes. It reflects the idea that God's criteria for leadership and honor are based on faithfulness and character rather than merely on status or position. This can be paralleled with the story of David himself, who was chosen by God to be king despite being the youngest and least likely candidate among his brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishai.htm">Abishai</a></b><br>The main figure in this verse, Abishai was the brother of Joab and a valiant warrior in King David's army.

Abishai&#8217;s record placed him just beneath the Three, yet notably above the rest of the Thirty (1 Chron 27:6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he became their commander</b><p>&#8226; While Abishai was not one of the Three, David appointed him as their leader, illustrating that leadership can be conferred even without sharing identical status (1 Chron 11:21; <a href="/2_samuel/23-19.htm">2 Samuel 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; His appointment models godly order: ability plus proven loyalty qualify a person to direct others (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The text underscores teamwork within David&#8217;s forces&#8212;distinct roles, one mission (1 Chron 11:10; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even though he was not included among the Three</b><p>&#8226; The Holy Spirit stresses the contrast: Abishai&#8217;s authority did not erase the unique standing of the Three.<p>&#8226; God often sets differing spheres of recognition without diminishing anyone&#8217;s worth (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>; <a href="/john/21-20.htm">John 21:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Abishai accepted his role without envy, reflecting humility that God esteems (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abishai&#8217;s story shows that God can bestow extraordinary honor and leadership on those who serve faithfully, yet still preserve a divinely ordered structure of roles.
