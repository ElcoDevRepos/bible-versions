His role was crucial in guiding the king according to God's will. Prophets in Israel were seen as God's mouthpieces, delivering divine messages. Nathan's relationship with David was one of mutual respect and trust, which is evident in their interactions. This phrase sets the stage for a significant moment where Nathan initially supports David's desire to build a temple, showing the prophet's initial human understanding before receiving further divine revelation.<p><b>&#8220;Do all that is in your heart</b><br>David's heart was set on building a temple for the Ark of the Covenant, a place of worship for the God of Israel. This desire reflects David's deep devotion and commitment to honoring God. In the cultural context of the time, building a temple was a way to establish a central place of worship and signify the nation's dedication to their deity. David's intention was noble, but it also highlights the human tendency to act on personal desires without fully understanding God's plan. This phrase underscores the importance of aligning one's heart with God's will.<p><b>for God is with you.&#8221;</b><br>This assurance from Nathan initially affirms God's favor upon David. Throughout David's life, God's presence was evident, from his anointing by Samuel to his victories in battle. The phrase "God is with you" is a powerful reminder of the covenant relationship between God and David, which is central to the Davidic Covenant. This covenant is a key theme in biblical theology, promising that David's lineage would endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Son of David. However, Nathan's later correction reveals that while God's presence was with David, His specific plans differed from David's intentions, teaching a lesson in divine sovereignty and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet during the reign of King David, Nathan served as a spiritual advisor and was instrumental in conveying God's messages to David.

Nathan&#8217;s immediate response shows:<p>&#8226; A pastor-like camaraderie&#8212;he listens and answers promptly (<a href="/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Confidence in David&#8217;s godly character, built through earlier episodes where &#8220;David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the LORD was with him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>).<p>&#8226; A reminder that prophets are human; although inspired, they can initially speak from sanctified common sense before receiving fresh revelation (compare the later night vision in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-3.htm">1 Chronicles 17:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>Parallel Scripture: <a href="/2_samuel/7-3.htm">2 Samuel 7:3</a> conveys the same moment, underscoring that the Chronicler is recounting reliable, literal history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Do all that is in your heart,</b><p>David&#8217;s &#8220;heart&#8221; is center stage. His motive is worship, not self-promotion (<a href="/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2&#8211;5</a>). By telling David to act, Nathan affirms:<p>&#8226; God values holy ambition&#8212;desires aligned with His glory (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine plans flow from inner devotion, not mere external duty (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>Yet later that night God will redirect the plan; this shows that even noble aims must stay yieldable (<a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>).<p>Cross references highlight David&#8217;s reputation for wholeheartedness: <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a> calls him &#8220;a man after My own heart,&#8221; while <a href="/1_kings/8-18.htm">1 Kings 8:18</a> commends his desire to build.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for God is with you."</b><p>Nathan anchors his counsel in a fact already demonstrated throughout David&#8217;s life:<p>&#8226; The Spirit rushed upon David &#8220;from that day forward&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Victories over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>), Saul&#8217;s armies (<a href="/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>), and surrounding nations all testify that &#8220;the LORD gave victory wherever he went&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Covenant promises in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-7.htm">1 Chronicles 17:7&#8211;14</a> will soon formalize this abiding presence.<p>Key lesson: God&#8217;s nearness empowers initiative, yet His sovereignty still governs details. Even after God says David will not build the temple, the statement &#8220;God is with you&#8221; remains true&#8212;demonstrating that divine companionship is larger than any single project (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/17-2.htm">1 Chronicles 17:2</a> records a warm, immediate affirmation from the prophet to the king. Nathan recognizes David&#8217;s sincere, God-centered desire and encourages him, confident of the Lord&#8217;s ongoing presence. The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; Trusted spiritual leaders often encourage righteous desires.<p>&#8226; God delights in hearts set on honoring Him, even when specific plans change.<p>&#8226; The certainty of God&#8217;s presence with His people is a bedrock truth that undergirds every endeavor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) Do.--Samuel, "Go, do."<p><span class= "bld">All that is in thine heart.</span>--According to Hebrew ideas, the heart was the seat of the mind and will, as well as of the emotions.

And that it was not radically wrong from a prophet may be inferred from the stress afterwards laid upon the acceptableness to God of what had been in the heart of David to do. Even with God, silence would sometimes be understood by a prophet to be equivalent to assent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Nathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5416.htm">Strong's 5416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nathan -- the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
