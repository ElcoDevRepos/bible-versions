This practice was often used to form political alliances and secure the king's lineage. However, it contrasts with the monogamous ideal presented in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. The city of Jerusalem, recently captured by David, became the political and spiritual center of Israel, symbolizing God's chosen city. David's actions here foreshadow the complexities and familial strife that would later arise, as seen in the lives of his sons, such as Absalom and Solomon.<p><b>and became the father of more sons and daughters.</b><br>The expansion of David's family through additional sons and daughters highlights the growth of his dynasty, which was crucial for establishing a lasting kingdom. This increase in offspring also fulfilled God's promise to David of a lasting lineage, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. The mention of both sons and daughters indicates the importance of family in David's reign, though it also sets the stage for future conflicts and challenges within his household. The genealogical records in 1 Chronicles emphasize the continuity of God's covenant with David, ultimately pointing to the Messianic line culminating in Jesus Christ, as noted in the genealogies of <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the King of Israel, known for his leadership, military conquests, and his heart for God.

Recognizing the accuracy of Scripture means accepting both the historical reality of David&#8217;s marriages and the implicit caution woven through biblical law.<p>&#8226; The statement also anticipates the complex family dynamics that later shape Israel&#8217;s history&#8212;most notably Absalom&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> &#8211; 18) and Solomon&#8217;s eventual accumulation of many wives (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and became the father of more sons and daughters</b><p>&#8226; Children were viewed as a covenant blessing; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a> affirms, &#8220;Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Chronicler lists these children in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>, grounding David&#8217;s lineage and establishing the genealogical bridge to Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the abundance of offspring also carried responsibility and potential strife, foreshadowing sibling rivalries seen in <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13-14</a> and <a href="/bsb/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promise to build David &#8220;a house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>) is two-fold:<p>&#8211; A physical dynasty through his sons.<p>&#8211; A spiritual kingdom culminating in the Messiah, referenced in <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>.<p>&#8226; Thus, the birth of many sons and daughters serves both as immediate evidence of divine favor and as a stepping-stone toward the greater fulfillment in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse records factual royal expansion&#8212;David taking additional wives and fathering numerous children&#8212;reflecting his elevated status and God&#8217;s blessing on his dynasty.

The concubines are not omitted because of offence, for they are mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="These were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.">1Chronicles 3:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took more wives</span>. As matter of course, we do not look in this connection for any remarks to be made by the writer condemnatory of David's enlargement of the harem, or of his having an harem at all. Yet it is open to us to note how, at a time when polygamy was "winked at," and no sin was necessarily to lie on this account at the door of David, yet by this very thing he was undermining the peace and unity of his own family, the comfort of his declining years once and again, and the very stability of his house in the days of Solomon his son. The less necessitated we are to regard David's polygamy in the light of individual sin, the more emphatic in the light of history does the <span class="accented">tendency</span> of the practice proclaim itself as thoroughly and irredeemably bad. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
