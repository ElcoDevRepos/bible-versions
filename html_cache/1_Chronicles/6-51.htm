This genealogy emphasizes the continuity of the priestly line, which was crucial for maintaining the religious and cultural identity of Israel. The name Bukki means "wasting" or "emptying," which may reflect the challenges faced by the priesthood during periods of Israel's history when they strayed from God. This lineage is also mentioned in <a href="/ezra/7-4.htm">Ezra 7:4</a>, highlighting the importance of maintaining a pure priestly line.<p><b>Uzzi his son</b><br>Uzzi, meaning "my strength," continues the priestly line. His name reflects the reliance on God's strength, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. Uzzi's inclusion in the genealogy underscores the importance of each generation in preserving the covenantal relationship with God. The priesthood's role was to mediate between God and the people, and Uzzi's position in this line signifies the ongoing responsibility of the priests to uphold the law and lead the people in worship.<p><b>Zerahiah his son</b><br>Zerahiah, meaning "the Lord has risen," is another link in the chain of the priestly lineage. His name can be seen as prophetic, pointing to the resurrection theme that is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The priestly line, including Zerahiah, served as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate High Priest. The continuity of this line is crucial for understanding the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus, who is both the perfect priest and the perfect sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bukki.htm">Bukki</a></b><br>A descendant of Aaron, Bukki is part of the priestly lineage.
