The genealogies in Chronicles often serve to establish tribal and familial connections among the Israelites, emphasizing the continuity of God's people. The names Shuppites and Huppites are also found in other genealogical records, such as <a href="/numbers/26-39.htm">Numbers 26:39</a>, where they are associated with the tribe of Benjamin. This connection highlights the importance of tribal identity and heritage in ancient Israel. The mention of these groups underscores the detailed record-keeping and the significance of lineage in maintaining the covenant community.<p><b>and the Hushites were descendants of Aher</b><br>The Hushites, identified as descendants of Aher, present a more complex genealogical note. The name Aher is not widely recognized in other biblical texts, leading to various interpretations. Some scholars suggest that Aher might be a variant or scribal error for another name, possibly Dan, as seen in some Septuagint manuscripts. This ambiguity reflects the challenges of ancient textual transmission and the importance of careful study to understand the historical context. The inclusion of the Hushites in this genealogy emphasizes the diversity within the tribes of Israel and the broader narrative of God's unfolding plan through various family lines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shuppim_and_huppim.htm">Shuppim and Huppim</a></b><br>These are the sons of Ir.

We have seen (see Note on <a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-6.htm" title="The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.">1Chronicles 7:6-11</a>) that <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a> names "Muppim and. Huppim" as sons of Benjamin, and that Numbers 26 has "Snephupham and Hupham" corresponding to the same pair of names. Lastly, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-5.htm" title="And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.">1Chronicles 8:5</a> mentions "Shephupham and Huram" among the sons of Bela, son of Benjamin. It is clear that "Muppim" is a mere slip of the pen for "Shuppim," to which the name Shephupham is really equivalent. From Shephupham, according to Numbers 26, sprang the clan of the "Shuphami" (Shuphamite), as from "Hupham" the clan of the Huphami. Shupham and Hupham are quite natural variants of Shuppim and Huppim. The "Huram" of <a href="/1_chronicles/8-5.htm" title="And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.">1Chronicles 8:5</a> is a scribe's error for "Hupham." Shuppim and Huppim, called sons of Benjamin in Genesis and Numbers, and sons of Bela in 1 Chronicles 8, are here called "sons of Ir;" <a href="/1_chronicles/7-7.htm" title="And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth, and Iri, five; heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of valor; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four.">1Chronicles 7:7</a> above informs us that Ir or Iri (? the Irite) was a son of Bela. There is no more contradiction here than there would be in calling the same person a son of David, son of Judah, and son of Abraham.<p><span class= "bld">Hushim, the</span> <span class= "bld">sons of Aher.</span>--The name Hushim (a <span class= "ital">plural</span> form) recurs at <a href="/1_chronicles/8-8.htm" title="And Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.">1Chronicles 8:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-11.htm" title="And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal.">1Chronicles 8:11</a>, as a Benjamite clan. Aher looks like a variant of the Ahiram of Numbers, and the Ahrah of 1 Chronicles 8, and perhaps of the Ehi-Rosh of Genesis. From this it would appear that the whole verse is an appendix to the genealogy of Benjamin. The word Aher, however, happens to mean <span class= "ital">another,</span> and if the reading were certain (comp. the variants Ahiram, Ahrah, &c), would be very singular as a proper name. The clause has been rendered "Hushim. sons of another;" and this odd expression has been taken to be a veiled reference to the tribe of Dan, whose name is omitted in the present section. <a href="/genesis/46-23.htm" title="And the sons of Dan; Hushim.">Genesis 46:23</a>, "And the sons of Dan, Hushim," a statement occurring like the present clause between that of the sons of Benjamin and the sons of Naphtali, is cited in support of this view. This last coincidence is certainly remarkable; but the following considerations are decidedly adverse to the view in question: 1. <a href="/numbers/26-42.htm" title="These are the sons of Dan after their families: of Shuham, the family of the Shuhamites. These are the families of Dan after their families.">Numbers 26:42</a> calls the offspring of Dan, Shuham, not Hushim, though there also Dan follows Benjamin. 2. Dan is, indeed, omitted here, but so also is Zebulun, just as Gad and Asher are omitted in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-16.htm" title="Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:">1Chronicles 27:16-22</a>; and Naphtali here has only one verse 3. The chronicler's dislike of the tribe of Dan is probably an unfounded supposition, suggested by some accidental omissions; he has mentioned that tribe by name in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-2.htm" title="Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.">1Chronicles 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-35.htm" title="And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.">1Chronicles 12:35</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-22.htm" title="Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.">1Chronicles 27:22</a>. If the omission in the present list be neither accidental nor due to imperfect MSS., it may be ascribed to later editors of the book. (Comp. Judges 18 and <a href="/context/revelation/7-5.htm" title="Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.">Revelation 7:5-8</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shuppim... and Huppim</span>.

They are here described as sons of Iri, or Ir, which would make them great-grandsons of Benjamin, a thing impossible. <span class="cmt_word">Hushim, the sons of Aher</span>.

Bertheau takes the opportunity of urging, in connection with this name, that <span class="accented">Dan</span> is not entirely omitted in our work of Chronicles! But his foundation is surely far too slender to build upon. Bertheau and Zockler (in Lange, 'Alt.
