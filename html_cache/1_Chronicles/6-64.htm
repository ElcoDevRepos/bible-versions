The Israelites were the chosen people of God, set apart to be a holy nation. This context is rooted in the covenant God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising them land, descendants, and blessings. The Israelites' identity is central to the narrative of the Old Testament, as they are the recipients of God's law and the ones through whom the Messiah would come.<p><b>gave to the Levites</b><br>The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties. Unlike the other tribes, the Levites did not receive a specific territory as their inheritance. Instead, they were given cities and pasturelands throughout the territories of the other tribes. This arrangement fulfilled God's command in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, where He instructed Moses to allocate cities for the Levites. The Levites' role was to serve in the tabernacle and later in the temple, acting as priests and caretakers of the holy things.<p><b>these cities and their pasturelands</b><br>The cities and pasturelands provided to the Levites were essential for their sustenance and ability to perform their duties. The cities served as places where the Levites could live and carry out their religious responsibilities, while the pasturelands allowed them to maintain livestock for food and sacrifices. This provision ensured that the Levites could focus on their spiritual duties without the need to engage in agriculture or other forms of labor. The allocation of these cities is detailed in <a href="/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>, where specific cities are listed for each Levitical family. This system also symbolizes the principle of God providing for those who serve Him, a theme echoed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul discusses the rights of those who preach the gospel to receive their living from it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were chosen by God to be His people.

This is clearly a summing up of the whole account so far. The eleven tribes have all been mentioned in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-65</a>.<p>The "cities" of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-64.htm" title="And the children of Israel gave to the Levites these cities with their suburbs.">1Chronicles 6:64</a> are those included in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-63</a>. So the parallel verse (<a href="/joshua/21-8.htm" title="And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.">Joshua 21:8</a>) refers back to <a href="/context/joshua/21-5.htm" title="And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.">Joshua 21:5-7</a>, which is parallel to our <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-63</a>. <a href="/joshua/21-9.htm" title="And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.">Joshua 21:9</a> (=our <a href="/1_chronicles/6-65.htm" title="And they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, these cities, which are called by their names.">1Chronicles 6:65</a>) <span class= "ital">introduces</span> the names of the cities which fell to the Aaronites.
