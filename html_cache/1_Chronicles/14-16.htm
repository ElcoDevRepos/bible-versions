This phrase highlights the importance of following divine guidance, a principle seen throughout Scripture. David's actions contrast with Saul's disobedience, which led to his downfall. Obedience to God is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>). David's willingness to follow God's instructions demonstrates his faith and reliance on divine wisdom rather than his own understanding.<p><b>and they struck down the army of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent enemy of Israel, often representing opposition to God's people. This victory is significant as it demonstrates God's power and favor upon David and Israel. The Philistines' defeat is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from their enemies (<a href="/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>). This victory also prefigures Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as David, a type of Christ, defeats the enemies of God's people.<p><b>all the way from Gibeon to Gezer</b><br>Gibeon and Gezer were significant locations in ancient Israel. Gibeon, a city of the Hivites, had previously made a treaty with Israel (Joshua 9). It was also the site of a significant battle where God intervened by causing the sun to stand still (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>). Gezer was a Canaanite city given to Solomon as a dowry (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>). The mention of these locations underscores the extent of the victory and the strategic importance of controlling these areas. This geographical detail emphasizes the thoroughness of the defeat and God's comprehensive deliverance of Israel from their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his military prowess.
