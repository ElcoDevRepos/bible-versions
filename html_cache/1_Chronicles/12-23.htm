The listing of numbers signifies the organized and substantial support for David, highlighting the legitimacy and strength of his claim to the throne. In ancient Israel, military might was a crucial factor in establishing and maintaining a kingdom. The emphasis on being "armed for battle" underscores the readiness and commitment of these men to support David's cause.<p><b>who came to David at Hebron</b><br>Hebron is a significant location in biblical history. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, and it held historical importance as the place where Abraham settled. David's anointing as king over Judah took place in Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>), making it a central location for his rise to power. The gathering of men at Hebron symbolizes a unification of support for David, marking a pivotal moment in his journey to becoming king over all Israel.<p><b>to turn Saul&#8217;s kingdom over to him</b><br>This phrase indicates a transfer of power from Saul's lineage to David. Saul, the first king of Israel, had fallen out of favor with God due to disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). The transition of the kingdom to David was not merely a political shift but a divinely ordained change. This transfer also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as he was chosen to lead Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>).<p><b>in accordance with the word of the LORD</b><br>The phrase emphasizes that the events unfolding were in fulfillment of divine prophecy and promise. God's word had declared David as the rightful king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>), and the gathering of support at Hebron was a manifestation of God's sovereign plan. This highlights the theme of divine providence and faithfulness, as God's promises to David were being realized. The phrase also underscores the legitimacy of David's kingship as being rooted in divine authority rather than mere human ambition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, chosen by God to succeed Saul.

The large numbers of some of the joyful pilgrims to Hebron, as for instance of the trans-Jordanic tribes, the very small number that came of the tribe of Judah (in fact, lowest but one, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Benjamin, and yet nearest home), and of some others, help to invest with doubt the numerals of this passage, although it is not at all difficult to suggest some very passable explanations of these phenomena.
