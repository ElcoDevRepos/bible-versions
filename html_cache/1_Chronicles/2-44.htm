The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the lineage and heritage of the tribes of Israel, particularly focusing on Judah, from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. The mention of Shema highlights the importance of family lineage in maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights. Raham, as his son, continues this lineage, emphasizing the continuity of the family line.<p><b>the father of Jorkeam</b><br>Jorkeam is a lesser-known figure, and his mention here serves to fill out the genealogical record. The chronicler's purpose in listing these names is to provide a comprehensive account of the descendants of Judah, ensuring that the historical and familial connections are preserved. This reflects the importance of ancestry in Israelite society, where family ties were crucial for social and religious identity.<p><b>and Rekem was the father of Shammai</b><br>Rekem and Shammai are also part of the genealogical record, contributing to the broader narrative of Judah's descendants. The chronicler's inclusion of these names, even when little else is known about them, underscores the meticulous nature of these records. It also highlights the interconnectedness of the tribes and families within Israel. The genealogies serve as a reminder of God's faithfulness in preserving His people and fulfilling His promises through specific family lines, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the fulfillment of the promises made to the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shema.htm">Shema</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Shema is noted as the father of Raham.
