The name means "Yahweh is his brother" or "Yahweh is his kin." In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>, Joah is part of the genealogical record of the Levites, specifically the descendants of Levi through Gershom. This lineage emphasizes the importance of the Levitical priesthood and their role in worship and temple service. The mention of Joah here connects to the broader narrative of the Levites' responsibilities in maintaining the spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>Iddo his son</b><br>Iddo is another name that appears in various contexts in the Old Testament. In this genealogical listing, Iddo is noted as a descendant of Levi, continuing the line of Levitical priests. The name Iddo means "timely" or "appointed," which may reflect the divine appointment of the Levitical line to their sacred duties. This lineage underscores the continuity of God's covenant with Israel, as the Levites were chosen to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, facilitating the people's worship and adherence to the Law.<p><b>Zerah his son</b><br>Zerah, meaning "rising" or "dawning," is a name that appears in several genealogies in the Bible. In this context, Zerah is part of the Levitical genealogy, highlighting the ongoing legacy of the priestly line. The mention of Zerah in this lineage serves to reinforce the idea of a divinely ordained order within the tribes of Israel, particularly the tribe of Levi, which was set apart for religious duties. This continuity is crucial for understanding the structure and function of Israelite society, where the Levites played a central role in spiritual leadership.<p><b>Jeatherai his son</b><br>Jeatherai, whose name means "remnant" or "survivor," concludes this particular segment of the genealogy. The inclusion of Jeatherai in the Levitical line emphasizes the preservation of the priestly lineage through generations. This preservation is significant in the biblical narrative, as it reflects God's faithfulness in maintaining a remnant of His people who are dedicated to His service. The genealogical record serves as a testament to the enduring nature of God's promises and the importance of the Levitical priesthood in the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joah.htm">Joah</a></b><br>A descendant in the Levitical line, Joah is part of the genealogy that traces the priestly lineage.

These parallels suggest the name remained honored among Levites who guarded true worship after the exile.<p>&#8226; The steady mention of fathers and sons reinforces God&#8217;s design for generational faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zerah his son</b><p>Zerah continues the succession.<p>&#8226; Though better known as a Judahite name (<a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>), here it identifies a Levite, proving that God redeems and reuses names in different tribes for His purposes.<p>&#8226; His placement just before Jeatherai keeps the seven-name span from Gershom intact (Libni &#8594; Jahath &#8594; Zimmah &#8594; Joah &#8594; Iddo &#8594; Zerah &#8594; Jeatherai), a pattern often linked with completeness (cf. <a href="/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeatherai his son</b><p>Jeatherai closes this particular list.<p>&#8226; The very fact that Scripture records even the &#8220;last-in-line&#8221; declares that no servant of God is forgotten (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; From Jeatherai, the genealogy turns to other branches (1 Chron 6:22ff.), showing how God weaves many family threads into one worshiping nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-21.htm">1 Chronicles 6:21</a> is more than a roll call; it is a testimony that God tracks every generation of His servants. Joah, Iddo, Zerah, and Jeatherai stand as links in an unbroken chain of Levites who guarded the tabernacle, the temple, and later the songs of praise. Their quiet faithfulness illustrates how the Lord values ordinary obedience, preserves family legacies, and completes His purposes through people whose names may appear only once&#8212;yet whose lives echo through Scripture and history.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3098.htm">Strong's 3098: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joah -- 'the LORD is brother', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his son,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
