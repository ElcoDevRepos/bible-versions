The casting of lots was a common biblical practice to determine God's will, seen in other instances such as the division of the land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>). Obed-edom is a significant figure, previously mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept in his house, bringing blessings upon him and his household. The South Gate likely refers to one of the gates of the temple or the city of Jerusalem, a critical position for maintaining security and order. This assignment reflects both trust and honor, as Obed-edom's household had been blessed by God, indicating his faithfulness and reliability.<p><b>and the lot for the storehouses to his sons</b><br>The storehouses were essential for the temple's operation, holding supplies such as grain, wine, and oil, which were used in offerings and for the sustenance of the priests and Levites. Assigning Obed-edom's sons to this task suggests a continuation of the blessing and responsibility bestowed upon their family. It highlights the importance of stewardship and faithfulness in managing God's provisions. This role also connects to the broader biblical theme of generational blessing and service, as seen in the Levitical duties passed down through families (<a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>). The mention of Obed-edom's sons underscores the biblical principle of family legacy in serving God, reminiscent of the promise to Abraham about his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed-edom.htm">Obed-edom</a></b><br>A Levite who was entrusted with the care of the Ark of the Covenant.
