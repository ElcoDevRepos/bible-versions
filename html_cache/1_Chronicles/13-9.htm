They were places of separation and judgment, symbolically representing a place where God&#8217;s presence could be discerned. The mention of Chidon, also known as Nachon in <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a>, indicates a specific location on the journey from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem. This journey was part of King David's effort to bring the Ark of the Covenant to the city, signifying the centrality of God's presence among His people. The threshing floor setting foreshadows a moment of divine judgment and intervention.<p><b>Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark</b><br>Uzzah's action was a direct violation of the divine command that no one was to touch the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). The Ark, representing God's holy presence, was to be carried by Levites using poles inserted through rings on its sides, as prescribed in <a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>. Uzzah's instinctive reaction, though seemingly well-intentioned, disregarded the sanctity and prescribed handling of the Ark. This moment underscores the holiness of God and the importance of obedience to His commands.<p><b>because the oxen had stumbled</b><br>The Ark was being transported on a new cart, a method not in accordance with the instructions given to the Israelites (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13-15</a>). The use of a cart, similar to the Philistine method of transporting the Ark (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7-8</a>), reflects a departure from divine instructions. The stumbling of the oxen serves as a catalyst for the unfolding event, highlighting human error and the consequences of not adhering to God's specific guidelines. This incident serves as a reminder of the need for reverence and careful obedience in matters concerning God&#8217;s holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah.htm">Uzzah</a></b><br>A Levite who was involved in transporting the Ark of the Covenant.

The <span class="accented">threshing-</span>floor was a circular plot of hard ground, from fifty to one hundred feet in diameter, on which the oxen trampled out the grain.
