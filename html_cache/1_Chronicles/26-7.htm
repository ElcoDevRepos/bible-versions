The mention of his sons highlights the continuation of a faithful lineage. Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad are not widely known figures in the Bible, but their inclusion signifies the importance of family roles in temple service. The names themselves carry meanings that reflect God's attributes or actions: Othni means "my strength," Rephael means "God has healed," Obed means "servant," and Elzabad means "God has given." These names may reflect the character or aspirations of the family.<p><b>his brothers were Elihu and Semachiah,</b><br>Elihu and Semachiah are noted as brothers, indicating a close-knit family structure that was typical in ancient Israelite society. The mention of brothers alongside sons suggests a broader family involvement in temple duties. Elihu means "He is my God," and Semachiah means "Yahweh has sustained." These names again emphasize a strong connection to faith and divine support, which was crucial for those serving in the temple.<p><b>also capable men.</b><br>The phrase "capable men" underscores the qualifications necessary for those serving in the temple. It implies not only physical ability but also spiritual and moral integrity. In the context of 1 Chronicles, being capable often included skills in leadership, administration, and worship. This mirrors the New Testament qualifications for church leaders, such as those found in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>, where character and ability are emphasized. The capability of these men would have been essential for maintaining the sanctity and order of temple worship, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God equipping His people for service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah.htm">Shemaiah</a></b><br>A Levite, whose sons were appointed as gatekeepers in the temple.

Each son&#8217;s name is recorded, underlining that God notices individuals, not just families. Like Jesse&#8217;s eight sons (<a href="/1_samuel/16-10.htm">1 Samuel 16:10&#8211;11</a>) or Jacob&#8217;s twelve (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22&#8211;26</a>), these four boys remind us that God&#8217;s plans often unfold through ordinary children who grow into servants in His house.<p>&#8226; Their birth follows the declaration that &#8220;God had blessed Obed-edom&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-5.htm">1 Chronicles 26:5</a>); these sons are part of that blessing, a living testimony that faithful service invites divine favor (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 6 already called them &#8220;leaders&#8221; and &#8220;mighty men of valor.&#8221; In other words, spiritual heritage can and should produce courageous leadership (2 <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The fact that the sons&#8217; names reappear later in division assignments (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8, 15</a>) shows continuity: they move from genealogy to active duty, just as believers move from salvation to service (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his brothers were Elihu and Semachiah</b><p>&#8220;Brothers&#8221; here means Shemaiah&#8217;s own brothers, sons of Obed-edom, who stand alongside their nephews. Family participation in ministry reflects the pattern of the Levites, where multiple generations worked shoulder to shoulder (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inclusion prevents ministry from becoming a one-man show. Together they model the body principle Paul later expounds: &#8220;the eye cannot say to the hand, &#8216;I have no need of you&#8217;&#8221; (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 12</a>:21).<p>&#8226; Elihu shares his name with one of David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a>), hinting at a family reputation for courage.<p>&#8226; The presence of Semachiah (whose name means &#8220;Yahweh has sustained&#8221;) underscores that God sustains whole households in His service, echoing Joshua&#8217;s pledge, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>also capable men</b><p>The phrase gathers everyone just mentioned&#8212;sons and brothers&#8212;under a single commendation. Capability here speaks of proven strength and trustworthy character, the same qualities Moses sought in leaders who would &#8220;fear God, be trustworthy, and hate dishonest gain&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; In temple service, &#8220;capable&#8221; meant physical readiness for guard duty (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-9.htm">1 Chronicles 26:9</a>), spiritual readiness for worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7&#8211;8</a>), and moral readiness for stewardship (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; The standard anticipated the New Testament requirement that overseers be &#8220;above reproach&#8221; (1 <a href="/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>). God&#8217;s work calls for able people; yet their ability flows from His enabling grace (2 <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly teaches that God honors competence developed within families. Skill, integrity, and courage are not accidental&#8212;they are cultivated under the fear of the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a> does more than list names. It celebrates a family&#8212;fathers, sons, and brothers&#8212;whom God blessed, equipped, and trusted with guarding His sanctuary. Their recorded names assure us that God values each servant. Their shared ministry models generational faithfulness. Their commendation as &#8220;capable men&#8221; challenges today&#8217;s believers to pursue the same blend of courage, integrity, and readiness in whatever gate He assigns us to watch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And Obed, Elzabad.</span>--This is probably corrupt, as the conjunction, which is used with the preceding names, is wanting between Obed and Elzabad.
