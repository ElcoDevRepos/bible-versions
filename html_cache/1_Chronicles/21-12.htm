In ancient Israel, agriculture was the backbone of society, and a famine would have severe economic and social repercussions. The number three is significant in Scripture, often symbolizing completeness or divine perfection. This option reflects a prolonged period of suffering and dependence on God's provision, reminiscent of the famine during the time of Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 41).<p><b>three months of being swept away before your enemies and overtaken by their swords</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of military defeat and vulnerability. In the historical context of Israel, being defeated by enemies was a sign of God's displeasure and a call to repentance. The sword symbolizes war and destruction, and this option would mean a loss of national security and pride. It echoes the consequences faced by Israel when they turned away from God, as seen in the cycles of the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14-15</a>).<p><b>or three days of the sword of the LORD&#8212;days of plague upon the land</b><br>The "sword of the LORD" signifies direct divine intervention and judgment. Plagues were often used by God as a means of punishment or correction, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-11). The brevity of three days contrasts with the severity of the judgment, highlighting the intensity of God's wrath. This option underscores the immediacy and power of divine action, reminiscent of the swift judgment seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.</b><br>The "angel of the LORD" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, often representing God's presence and executing His will. This phrase suggests a widespread and thorough judgment, affecting the entire nation. The angel of the LORD is sometimes seen as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, acting as God's agent of judgment and mercy, as seen in the story of the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>).<p><b>Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the gravity of the decision facing David. It emphasizes human responsibility in responding to divine judgment. The phrase "Him who sent me" indicates the messenger's role as a divine envoy, underscoring the seriousness of the message. This decision-making process is a test of faith and wisdom, similar to the choices faced by leaders like Moses and Joshua when confronted with God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered a census of the people, which was against God's will, leading to the judgment options presented in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to David, presenting the three options for judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation facing the consequences of David's sin, highlighting the communal impact of a leader's actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who would carry out the judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who is sovereign and just, offering David a choice in the form of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>David's decision to conduct a census without God's approval led to severe consequences, reminding us of the importance of obedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Gad's role as a messenger highlights the importance of listening to God's appointed leaders and the messages they bring.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_leadership.htm">The Weight of Leadership</a></b><br>David's actions affected the entire nation, illustrating how leaders' decisions can have widespread implications.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The options for judgment reflect God's justice, but also His mercy in allowing David to choose, showing that even in discipline, God provides a path for redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>David's eventual repentance and God's response demonstrate the power of turning back to God and seeking His forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_21_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Chronicles_21_12_Disobedience_s_cost.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 21:12 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_justice_in_1_Chr_21_12.htm">What can we learn about God's justice from 1 Chronicles 21:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_is_God_s_mercy_shown_in_2_Sam_24.htm">How does this verse connect to God's mercy in 2 Samuel 24?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Responding_to_God_s_discipline_6.htm">How should we respond to God's discipline as seen in 1 Chronicles 21:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_sin_and_its_effects.htm">What steps can we take to avoid sin and its consequences today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_three_punishments_for_David_in_1_Chr_21_12.htm">Why did God offer David three severe punishments in 1 Chronicles 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_David_s_3_choices_important_2.htm">What is the significance of the three choices given to David in 1 Chronicles 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Chron_21_12_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 21:12 reflect God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_chronicles_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Chronicles 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/could_warriors_cross_jordan_at_flood_and_win.htm">(1 Chronicles 12:14-15) How plausible is it that warriors crossed the Jordan River at flood stage and still overpowered enemy forces?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_many_famine_years_for_david.htm">God sent his prophet to threaten David with how many years of famine?

In Israel&#8217;s agrarian culture, three years without adequate harvest would bring national distress, echoing covenant warnings like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22-24</a> and Elijah&#8217;s drought in <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>.<p>&#8226; Famine is gradual; everyone feels it, rich and poor alike. The punishment would strip the nation of self-reliance, pushing them to seek the Lord, much as Joseph&#8217;s generation did in <a href="/bsb/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p>&#8226; David would face the sorrow of watching people suffer while unable to feed them&#8212;an indirect yet pervasive judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three months of being swept away before your enemies and overtaken by their swords</b><p>&#8226; This choice (1 Chron 21:12b) recalls <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, where God warned that disobedience would lead to defeat.<p>&#8226; Three months of military humiliation means constant pursuit, refugee life, and the shame of national vulnerability.

David trusts divine compassion more than human cruelty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Gad offers David three literal, covenant-grounded judgments: prolonged scarcity, relentless enemies, or an intense, brief plague by God&#8217;s own hand. Each option exposes the folly of David&#8217;s census and calls the nation back to humble dependence on the Lord. David&#8217;s choice to fall under God&#8217;s direct discipline underscores both the severity of sin and the surpassing mercy found in the Lord alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Three years' famine.</span>--This appears correct, as harmonising with the three months and three days of the other visitations. Samuel has the reading "seven," which perhaps originated in some scribe's memory of the famine described in <a href="/genesis/41-30.htm" title="And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;">Genesis 41:30</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span><p><span class= "bld">To be destroyed.</span>--Samuel has, "thy flying," and so LXX. and Vulg. here. This is doubtless right, as the word in our Hebrew text might easily be a corrupt form of that in Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">While that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and the sword of thy foes at overtaking.</span> The word "overtaking" (<span class= "ital">massegeth</span>) only occurs besides in <a href="/leviticus/14-21.htm" title="And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;">Leviticus 14:21</a>. Samuel has simply, "and he pursuing thee." Perhaps the right text is, <span class= "ital">and he pursue thee to overtaking.</span> (Comp. the Syriac here: "Three months thou shalt be subdued before thy enemy, and he shall be pursuing thee, and he shall be mastering thee.")<p><span class= "bld">Or else three days the sword of the Lord . . . coasts of Israel.</span>--Samuel has the brief, "Or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land." Our text appears to be an exegetical expansion of the older statement. Others suppose it to be the original, of which Samuel is an epitome, alleging that otherwise "the angel" is introduced in <a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:16</a> quite suddenly and abruptly. But we must remember that in the thought of those times pestilence and "the sword," or <span class= "ital">"</span>angel of the Lord," would be suggestive of each other. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2Kings 19:35</a>; and for the three judgments, <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm" title="So will I send on you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you: and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you.
