The Levites were descendants of Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and were set apart for religious duties (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). Their responsibilities included caring for the tabernacle and later the temple, as well as assisting the priests. The "articles used in worship" likely included items such as the altar utensils, lampstands, and other sacred objects necessary for temple rituals. This role underscores the importance of order and reverence in worship, reflecting God's holiness and the need for careful stewardship of sacred items.<p><b>to count them whenever they were brought in or taken out</b><br>This duty of counting the articles highlights the meticulous care and accountability required in temple service. The process of counting ensured that nothing was lost or misused, maintaining the sanctity of worship. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament principle of stewardship, where believers are called to be faithful managers of God's resources (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>). The careful handling of these items also points to the broader biblical theme of God's order and precision, as seen in the detailed instructions for the tabernacle's construction in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>. This attention to detail in worship reflects the character of God, who is a God of order and not chaos (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The Levites were the tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and temple service.
