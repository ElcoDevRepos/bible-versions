It symbolized God's presence and covenant with Israel. During the reign of Saul, the Ark was neglected and remained in Kiriath-jearim after being returned by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). David's desire to bring back the Ark signifies a renewed focus on worship and reverence for God. This act foreshadows the centrality of Christ in worship, as He is the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>for we did not inquire of Him in the days of Saul.</b><br>Saul's reign was marked by a lack of spiritual leadership and failure to seek God's guidance, as seen in his disobedience and eventual rejection by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>). The absence of the Ark during Saul's reign symbolizes the spiritual decline and neglect of God's law. David's initiative to bring back the Ark represents a turning point, emphasizing the importance of seeking God's will and guidance. This reflects the biblical principle that true leadership involves dependence on God, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses and Joshua. The phrase also highlights the necessity of repentance and returning to God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel who desires to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem, signifying a return to seeking God's guidance and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel and His presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, during whose reign the Ark was neglected, symbolizing a period of spiritual decline and disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which under David's leadership, seeks to restore its relationship with God by bringing back the Ark.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-jearim.htm">Kiriath-jearim</a></b><br>The place where the Ark had been kept for many years after being returned by the Philistines, highlighting a period of neglect in seeking God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_presence.htm">The Importance of God's Presence</a></b><br>David's initiative to bring back the Ark highlights the necessity of prioritizing God's presence in our lives.
