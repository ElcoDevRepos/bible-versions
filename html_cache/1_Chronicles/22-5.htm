Solomon's age is significant as he is estimated to be around 20 years old at this time. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the young and seemingly unprepared to fulfill His purposes, as seen with figures like Joseph and Timothy. It also underscores the importance of mentorship and preparation in leadership roles.<p><b>and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent&#8212;</b><br>The temple's magnificence is emphasized, reflecting its purpose as a dwelling place for God among His people. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's holiness and the reverence due to Him. The temple was to be a physical representation of God's glory and presence, similar to the tabernacle described in Exodus. The use of the word "magnificent" indicates the temple's role as a central place of worship and its importance in Israel's religious life.<p><b>famous and glorious throughout all lands.</b><br>The temple's fame and glory were intended to extend beyond Israel, symbolizing God's universal sovereignty and the call for all nations to recognize His greatness. This foreshadows the New Testament theme of the gospel reaching all nations, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The temple was not only a national symbol but also a testament to God's power and majesty to the surrounding nations.<p><b>Therefore I must make preparations for it.&#8221;</b><br>David's commitment to preparing for the temple's construction demonstrates his dedication to God's plans, even though he would not see its completion. This reflects the biblical principle of laying groundwork for future generations, as seen in the legacy of faith passed down through the patriarchs. David's preparations included gathering materials and organizing labor, showing his understanding of the temple's significance and his role in God's plan.<p><b>So David made lavish preparations before his death.</b><br>David's extensive preparations highlight his devotion and the importance of the temple project. The term "lavish" indicates the abundance and quality of resources he gathered, such as gold, silver, and cedar wood, which were necessary for the temple's construction. This act of preparation is a testament to David's faith and foresight, ensuring that Solomon had everything needed to fulfill God's command. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of stewardship and planning in fulfilling God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desires to build a temple for the LORD but is instructed by God that his son Solomon will build it instead.
