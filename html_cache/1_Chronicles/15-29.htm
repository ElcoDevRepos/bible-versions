Its entry into the City of David, which is Jerusalem, marked a significant moment in Israel's religious history. David had established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel, and bringing the Ark there symbolized God's blessing and favor. This event fulfilled David's desire to make Jerusalem the heart of worship for the nation, aligning with God's plan for a centralized place of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>).<p><b>Saul&#8217;s daughter Michal looked down from a window</b><br>Michal, the daughter of Saul and wife of David, observed the procession from a window, a position that suggests detachment and possibly judgment. Her lineage as Saul's daughter is significant, as it highlights the tension between Saul's house and David's. Windows in ancient times were often small openings, indicating that Michal was not participating in the celebration but rather observing from a distance, both physically and emotionally.<p><b>and saw King David dancing and celebrating</b><br>David's dancing was an expression of exuberant worship and joy before the LORD. His actions demonstrated a heart fully devoted to God, unashamed to express his faith publicly. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical figures who worshiped with abandon, such as Miriam in <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>. David's celebration was a public acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and blessing upon Israel.<p><b>and she despised him in her heart</b><br>Michal's disdain for David's actions reveals a deeper spiritual and relational conflict. Her contempt may have stemmed from her upbringing in Saul's household, where the focus was more on royal dignity than on heartfelt worship. This internal conflict is further explored in <a href="/2_samuel/6-20.htm">2 Samuel 6:20-23</a>, where Michal confronts David, and he defends his actions as being for the LORD. Her despising of David can be seen as a rejection of the new spiritual order that David was establishing, contrasting with her father's reign. This moment also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the failure to recognize genuine worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_david.htm">City of David</a></b><br>Also known as Jerusalem, it was the political and spiritual center of Israel during King David's reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal,_daughter_of_saul.htm">Michal, Daughter of Saul</a></b><br>The first wife of King David and daughter of the former King Saul.

Outward observation without inward participation breeds bitterness (<a href="/mark/7-6.htm">Mark 7:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a> contrasts two hearts witnessing the same event. David, awed by God&#8217;s returned presence, expresses unrestrained, obedient joy; Michal, shaped by pride and distance, responds with contempt. The verse calls us to welcome the LORD&#8217;s presence with wholehearted worship, aligning both outward action and inward attitude with the literal truth and authority of God&#8217;s Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">And it</span> <span class= "bld">came to pass.</span>--The verse reads in the Hebrew like a modernised form of <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As the ark of the covenant of the Lord came.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">The ark had come so far as to the city, and Michal had looked forth by the lattice, and she saw</span> . . .<p><span class= "bld">Dancing and playing.</span>--In the Hebrew two common words have been substituted for the two obsolete ones occurring in Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">Playing.</span>--The Hebrew word denotes dancing combined with singing and playing (<a href="/jeremiah/30-19.htm" title="And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.">Jeremiah 30:19</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6-7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">She despised him.</span>--Because he seemed forgetful of his royal and manly honour, in dancing like a woman.<p><span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Thus briefly is given by our compiler what occupies five verses (<a href="/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19, 20-23</a>) in the Book of Samuel. Neither of the words here rendered <span class="cmt_word">dancing and playing</span> (but which would be better rendered "leaping and dancing") is the same with those employed in <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14, 16</a>, where our Authorized Version rendering is "dancing" and "leaping and dancing" respectively. The word in both of those verses that represents the dancing, does correctly so represent, bet is a somewhat generic form, as it carries the idea of dancing in a circle. The reason of Michal "despising David in her heart" can only be found in the unreason and the irreligion of that heart itself. She was a type of not a few, who despise devotion, enthusiasm, and above all practical liberality and generosity, on the part of any individual of their own family, when these are shown to Christ and his Church, and when they think they may be a trifle the poorer for it, or when they feel that the liberality and devotion of another exposes their own "poverty" in both these respects. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As the ark</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_727.htm">Strong's 727: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chest, ark</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the covenant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1285.htm">Strong's 1285: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covenant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
