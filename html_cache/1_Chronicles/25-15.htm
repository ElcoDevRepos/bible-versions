The number eight often symbolizes new beginnings or a new order in biblical numerology, which may suggest a fresh start or renewal in worship practices. Jeshaiah's name means "Yahweh is salvation," reflecting a common theme in the Old Testament of God's deliverance and faithfulness. This appointment is part of the broader organization of temple worship, emphasizing the importance of structured and continuous praise to God.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial aspect of temple service, where musical duties were often passed down through family lines. It underscores the communal and hereditary nature of worship roles in ancient Israel, where skills and responsibilities were shared among family members. This practice ensured continuity and stability in temple worship, as well as the preservation of musical traditions. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of family and community in serving God, as seen in other passages where families are called to serve together.<p><b>12 in all</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often representing completeness or divine order, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. In this context, the number of musicians in Jeshaiah's group may symbolize a complete and perfect unit for their assigned task in temple worship. This completeness in number could also reflect the organized and intentional nature of worship in the temple, ensuring that all aspects of praise and music were covered adequately. The use of twelve musicians may also draw a parallel to the structure and order found in other areas of Israelite society and religious practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeshaiah.htm">Jeshaiah</a></b><br>A leader among the musicians appointed by King David for the service of the house of the Lord.
