Historically, the Simeonites were allocated land within the territory of Judah (<a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>). This movement of five hundred Simeonites indicates a significant expedition or migration, possibly due to overpopulation or seeking new opportunities. The number "five hundred" suggests a substantial group, indicating a well-organized and purposeful mission.<p><b>led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi</b><br>These leaders are identified as sons of Ishi, a name meaning "my husband" or "my salvation," which may symbolize leadership and deliverance. The mention of specific leaders highlights the importance of leadership in tribal movements and decisions. Each name carries meaning: Pelatiah means "Yahweh delivers," Neariah means "servant of Yahweh," Rephaiah means "Yahweh has healed," and Uzziel means "God is my strength." These names reflect a strong spiritual heritage and reliance on God, which was crucial for the success of their endeavors.<p><b>went to Mount Seir</b><br>Mount Seir is a mountainous region historically associated with the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, known as the Edomites (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8-9</a>). This area is located southeast of the Dead Sea, in present-day Jordan. The Simeonites' journey to Mount Seir suggests a possible conquest or settlement in Edomite territory, which aligns with the biblical theme of Israel expanding its borders. This movement could also be seen as fulfilling God's promise to give the Israelites land, as well as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over all nations. The historical context of Mount Seir as Edomite territory adds a layer of complexity, as it reflects the ongoing tensions and interactions between Israel and Edom throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeonites.htm">Simeonites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Simeon, one of Jacob's twelve sons.

Here, exactly &#8220;five hundred&#8221; men are named, underscoring the historical precision of Scripture (cf. <a href="/numbers/1-23.htm">Numbers 1:23</a> for earlier census numbers).<p>- Their action follows a previous expedition in which Simeonites &#8220;struck down the remnant of the Amalekites&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41</a>). God had long commanded Israel to blot out Amalek (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>); these 500 men are faithfully completing that mandate.<p>- The number also highlights God&#8217;s ability to use a comparatively small group for His larger purposes, echoing victories by select forces such as Gideon&#8217;s 300 (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel</b><p>- Scripture bothers to name leaders, stressing accountability and the importance of godly leadership (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>).<p>- These men model servant-leadership: they go with the people rather than merely sending them. Their names appear nowhere else, reminding us that even &#8220;unknown&#8221; believers can have lasting impact when they obey God.<p>- Multiple leaders prevent a &#8220;one-man show,&#8221; reflecting the wisdom of shared oversight found in <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a> and <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sons of Ishi</b><p>- By connecting the four leaders to their father, the text affirms family heritage and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>).<p>- Ishi&#8217;s name links this group back to Simeon&#8217;s line, grounding their authority in tribal legitimacy (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>).<p>- Scripture often lists genealogies to show God&#8217;s meticulous record-keeping and to encourage us that He knows each family (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went to Mount Seir</b><p>- Mount Seir is Edomite territory (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>). The journey southward suggests both courage and obedience, for Edom was traditionally hostile (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>).<p>- They likely sought new pastureland, similar to earlier movements described in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39-40</a>, trusting God&#8217;s promise of land provision (<a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3-4</a>).<p>- Their successful occupation (see v.43) previews the ultimate reign of Israel&#8217;s Messiah over all neighboring lands (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 19</a>-21).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a> records a precise, historical incident in which 500 faithful Simeonites, under four trustworthy brothers, push into Mount Seir to fulfill God&#8217;s longstanding purposes. The verse showcases God&#8217;s use of ordinary yet obedient people, the importance of shared leadership rooted in covenant lineage, and confidence that when He sends His people, He also secures their inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">Went.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">had gone</span> (marched). The time of this expedition to mount Seir is not expressed; but for that very reason it is likely to have been nearly contemporaneous with the events just described. The band of five hundred would seem to have belonged to the clans which had already smitten the Hamites. Neither Ishi (<span class= "ital">Yish'i</span>) nor his sons are otherwise known. If a totally different expedition were intended, the expression, "and of them--of the sons of Simeon--five hundred men," would be a needlessly misleading periphrasis for, "And some of the sons of Simeon." "Of them" can only refer to the clans whose emigration in the days of Hezekiah has been the subject of this section.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42, 43.</span> - These verses give the further exploits, with a view of settlement, of certain of the tribe of Simeon. And of them we should prefer to apply to those already mentioned (vers. 34-41), did the expression stand alone. But the following clause in apposition, of the sons of Simeon, seems intended to <span class="accented">prevent</span> the supposition that <span class="accented">they are</span> the Simeonites to whom alone allusion is made. Keil again ('Comm.,' in <span class="accented">loc</span>.) refers those intended to ver. 27, because he reads, for Ishi, the Shimei of ver. 27, on very insufficient grounds. It is a question whether the movement of ver. 42 is to be understood as arising out of that other the account of which closes in ver. 41, or whether it were not a co-ordinate movement. It still would probably enough spring from the same intrinsic causes. The allotment of the tribe of Simeon carved out of that of Judah was found too small for their growing numbers, though Simeon was not of the most numerous. Nor is it necessary to suppose - perhaps it is rather necessary to <span class="accented">correct</span> the impression - that this expedition, issuing in a permanent settlement, lay at all near the conquests of the "thirteen princes." It is, on the whole, most natural to consider that one event concludes with ver. 41, and that the following events (vers. 42, 43) are distinct and independent. All requisite light as to who these "smitten Amalekites" were, is for them too significantly furnished by comparison of <a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>; with <a href="/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>.
