During this era, the Israelites were a small family clan rather than a large nation. This smallness highlights God's sovereign choice and protection over them despite their vulnerability. The promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> that his descendants would become a great nation underscores the miraculous growth from a few individuals to a populous nation. This also reflects God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises despite seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>Few indeed</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the insignificance of their numbers, underscoring the miraculous nature of their survival and growth. This small beginning is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God often uses the weak and insignificant to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>. It also serves as a reminder of God's providence and the importance of faith in His promises, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs who trusted God despite their small numbers.<p><b>And strangers in the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the nomadic lifestyle of the patriarchs, who lived as sojourners in Canaan, a land promised to them but not yet possessed. This status as "strangers" is significant in biblical theology, as it points to the idea of God's people being pilgrims on earth, looking forward to a heavenly homeland (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>). The patriarchs' status as strangers also foreshadows Israel's later experiences in Egypt and Babylon, and ultimately the Christian's journey in the world. The land of Canaan, where they were strangers, is central to biblical history and prophecy, being the land promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). This promise is foundational to the biblical narrative and is fulfilled in various stages throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The verse refers to the early days of the Israelites, highlighting their small numbers and status as foreigners in the land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were strangers, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The context of this verse is a psalm of thanksgiving delivered by King David when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that represented God's presence and covenant with Israel, central to the events surrounding this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_with_abraham.htm">Covenant with Abraham</a></b><br>The promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants and the land, which is the backdrop for the Israelites' journey and settlement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_small_beginnings.htm">God's Faithfulness in Small Beginnings</a></b><br>God often starts with small beginnings to fulfill His grand purposes.
