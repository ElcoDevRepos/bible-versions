Maacah, his wife, is mentioned here, highlighting the importance of lineage and family heritage in Israelite culture. The birth of a son was significant, as it ensured the continuation of the family line and inheritance rights. This reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where lineage through the male line was crucial.<p><b>and she named him Peresh</b><br>The act of naming a child was significant in biblical times, often reflecting circumstances of birth, prophetic insights, or parental hopes. The name Peresh means "division" or "separation," which could imply a future role or characteristic of the child. Naming by the mother is notable, as it sometimes indicates a special circumstance or divine intervention, similar to other biblical narratives where mothers name their children.<p><b>His brother was named Sheresh</b><br>Sheresh, meaning "root" or "foundation," suggests stability or foundational strength. The mention of brothers highlights the importance of family ties and the potential for future tribal leadership or influence. The naming of both brothers together may indicate their joint significance in the genealogical record of the tribe of Manasseh.<p><b>and his sons were Ulam and Rekem</b><br>Ulam and Rekem, the sons of Sheresh, continue the genealogical line. Ulam means "porch" or "vestibule," possibly symbolizing a place of gathering or entry, while Rekem means "variegation" or "embroidery," suggesting diversity or intricacy. These names may reflect the roles or characteristics expected of them within their family or tribe. The continuation of the lineage through these sons emphasizes the importance of family heritage and the fulfillment of God's promises to the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/machir.htm">Machir</a></b><br>He is the son of Manasseh, one of the tribes of Israel.
