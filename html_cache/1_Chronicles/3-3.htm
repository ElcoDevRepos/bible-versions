The name Shephatiah means "Yahweh has judged" or "Yahweh is a judge," reflecting a common practice of naming children with theophoric elements, which are names that include the name of God. Abital, whose name means "my father is dew," is one of David's lesser-known wives, and little is mentioned about her elsewhere in the Bible. This phrase highlights the polygamous nature of David's household, which was typical for kings of that era, as it was a means of forming political alliances and ensuring a large progeny. The mention of Shephatiah and Abital in the genealogical record underscores the importance of lineage and heritage in the biblical narrative, particularly in the context of the Davidic line, which is significant for the messianic prophecies concerning Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David."<p><b>and the sixth was Ithream by his wife Eglah.</b><br>Ithream, the sixth son of David, is noted as being born to Eglah. The name Ithream means "abundance of people" or "advantage of the people," which may reflect a hope or prophecy concerning his future or the future of his descendants. Eglah is referred to as David's wife, and some Jewish traditions suggest she may have been his favorite, though the biblical text does not provide further details about her. The inclusion of Ithream and Eglah in this genealogical list serves to document the full scope of David's family, which is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics within his household and the subsequent history of Israel. This genealogical record is part of the Chronicler's broader purpose to trace the lineage of the tribes of Israel, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant promises through the line of David, which ultimately points to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises made to David regarding an everlasting kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shephatiah.htm">Shephatiah</a></b><br>The fifth son of King David, born to him by Abital.
