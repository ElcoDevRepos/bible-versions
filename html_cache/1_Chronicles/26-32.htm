God values capable leadership that unites faith and practical affairs, ensuring His people honor Him in every part of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Chief fathers</span>. The number of chief fathers mentioned in this verse leads Keil to point out very justly that here at least the designation cannot mean anything beyond the fathers of individual families - cannot mean the heads of those groups which are composed of all the branches or relations of one house. They must have been heads of households (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), not heads of <span class="accented">fathers</span> <span class="accented">houses</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). The ambiguity is owing to the use of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> in ver. 32, the latter of which words has so often supposed the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> to precede it, coupled to it by a hyphen. Adding the numbers of vers. 30 and 32, we find a total of Hebronite "officers and judges" amounting to four thousand four hundred. The remaining sixteen hundred to complete the" six thousand" were drawn from the Gershon, Amram, and Izhar families. Some of the Uzzielites probably helped the Hebronites. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/26-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Among Jerijah&#8217;s relatives</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
