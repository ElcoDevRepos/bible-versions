The role of the Levites was hereditary, passed down through generations, as established in the time of Moses (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). This hereditary service underscores the importance of maintaining a continuous and faithful lineage dedicated to the service of God.<p><b>were assigned to guard the gates</b><br>Guarding the gates was a significant responsibility, ensuring the sanctity and security of the temple.

The role of gatekeepers is also mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/26.htm">1 Chronicles 26</a>, highlighting their importance in temple service. This duty symbolizes spiritual vigilance, akin to the New Testament call for believers to be watchful (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>of the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites.

The term "Tent" emphasizes the continuity of God's dwelling with His people, from the Tabernacle to the permanent structure of the temple.
