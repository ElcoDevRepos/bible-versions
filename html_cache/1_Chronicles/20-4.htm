It reflects the cyclical nature of warfare in the ancient Near East, where periods of conflict were often interspersed with times of relative peace.<p><b>war broke out with the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant adversary of Israel throughout the Old Testament. Known for their advanced military technology, including iron weaponry, they frequently clashed with Israel. This ongoing conflict highlights the struggle for dominance in the region and the spiritual battle between the worship of Yahweh and the pagan practices of the Philistines.<p><b>at Gezer</b><br>Gezer was a strategically important city located in the Shephelah, the lowland region of ancient Israel. Archaeological excavations have uncovered fortifications and evidence of occupation by various peoples, including the Canaanites and Philistines.
