The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, was the innermost and most sacred area of the Tabernacle, later the Temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. Only the high priest, initially Aaron, could enter this sacred space, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This highlights the exclusivity and sanctity of their priestly duties, emphasizing the separation between God and humanity due to sin, and the need for a mediator, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>They presented the offerings on the altar of burnt offering and on the altar of incense</b><br>The altar of burnt offering was located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle and was used for sacrifices that symbolized atonement and dedication to God. The altar of incense, situated in the Holy Place, was used to burn incense, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God. These rituals were central to Israelite worship and underscored the need for atonement and intercession. The offerings foreshadowed Christ's ultimate sacrifice, and the incense represents the prayers of believers, as seen in <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>.<p><b>to make atonement for Israel</b><br>Atonement involved the covering or removal of sin, allowing for reconciliation between God and His people. The sacrificial system was a temporary measure pointing to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection provided a once-for-all sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of a sacrificial system to maintain a relationship with a holy God.<p><b>according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.</b><br>Moses, as God's chosen leader and prophet, received the Law and instructions for worship directly from God. His role as a mediator between God and Israel prefigures Christ, the ultimate mediator of a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). The adherence to Moses' commands reflects the importance of obedience to God's revealed will, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, emphasizing that true worship is conducted according to God's

meticulous work required in God&#8217;s presence, the dual altars of sacrifice and incense, the goal of atonement for the nation, and the non-negotiable standard of obedience to God&#8217;s revealed word. Together these elements form a vivid picture of holy mediation&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;showing that access to God is costly, ordered, and graciously provided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(49) <span class= "bld">But Aaron and his sons offered.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And Aaron and his sons were offering.</span> The participle denotes unintermitted action.
