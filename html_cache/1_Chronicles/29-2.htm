This reflects his deep commitment to God and the importance of the temple as a central place of worship. David's preparation is a model of stewardship and devotion, emphasizing the importance of using one's resources and abilities for God's purposes. This phrase also highlights the concept of giving one's best to God, a theme echoed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>.<p><b>gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood,</b><br>David meticulously gathers materials according to their specific uses in the temple, demonstrating wisdom and orderliness. Gold, silver, bronze, iron, and wood were common materials used in ancient Near Eastern construction, especially in significant buildings. The use of these materials signifies the temple's grandeur and the reverence due to God. The specificity of materials also reflects the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle in Exodus, showing continuity in worship practices.<p><b>as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble&#8212;all in abundance.</b><br>The inclusion of precious stones and marble indicates the temple's beauty and splendor, befitting a dwelling place for God. Onyx and other stones were used in the high priest's garments (<a href="/exodus/28-9.htm">Exodus 28:9-20</a>), symbolizing purity and divine presence. The abundance of these materials underscores the generosity and willingness of David and the people to honor God. This abundance can be seen as a foreshadowing of the heavenly Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where precious stones and materials are used to describe the city's glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is speaking in this verse.

What God deserves is not half-hearted effort but our very best&#8212;just as <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a> urges us to work &#8220;with all your might,&#8221; and <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> reminds believers to serve &#8220;heartily, as for the Lord.&#8221; David&#8217;s example encourages every believer to marshal every resource&#8212;strength, skill, influence&#8212;for God&#8217;s glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>made provision for the house of my God</b><p>The king views the temple as God&#8217;s own dwelling among His people, echoing the Lord&#8217;s promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a> that David&#8217;s son would &#8220;build a house for My name.&#8221; Though David cannot build it himself (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), he treats the task as his personal responsibility, reminiscent of Moses gathering materials for the tabernacle in <a href="/bsb/exodus/35.htm">Exodus 35&#8211;36</a>. Provision comes before construction; faithful foresight honors God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gold for the gold articles</b><p>Gold, the most precious metal, symbolizes divine glory (<a href="/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>). David&#8217;s willingness to supply it anticipates a future sanctuary radiant with God&#8217;s presence, foreshadowing the heavenly city where &#8220;the street of the city was pure gold&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>). Giving the costliest material first sets the tone&#8212;nothing is too valuable for the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>silver for the silver</b><p>Silver speaks of redemption (<a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). By allocating silver specifically &#8220;for the silver,&#8221; David ensures each element fits its intended purpose. The principle of designated giving appears again in <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>, where early believers laid offerings at the apostles&#8217; feet for precise distribution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bronze for the bronze</b><p>Bronze, durable and bright, was used for the altar and laver in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>). Its inclusion stresses strength and judgment&#8212;qualities met ultimately at the cross (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>). David&#8217;s list mirrors God&#8217;s earlier pattern, showing continuity between tabernacle and temple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>iron for the iron</b><p>Iron, stronger yet common, highlights that both remarkable and ordinary resources matter. As <a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a> notes, &#8220;vessels of gold and silver&#8221; stand alongside those of &#8220;wood and clay.&#8221; Each fulfills a role in God&#8217;s house when offered willingly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wood for the wood</b><p>Cedar and cypress would line walls and ceilings (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-15</a>). Wood, though perishable, gains permanence when set apart for God, much like believers&#8212;earthen vessels filled with eternal treasure (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>onyx for the settings</b><p>Onyx adorned the high priest&#8217;s ephod (<a href="/exodus/28-9.htm">Exodus 28:9-12</a>). David&#8217;s mention ties temple worship back to priestly intercession, anticipating Christ our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>). Even the gemstones testify to atonement and remembrance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>turquoise, stones of various colors</b><p>Varied gems celebrate God&#8217;s creativity and beauty (<a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). Diversity within unity reflects the church&#8217;s many members, one body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>). Every shade and shape, when placed in God&#8217;s design, magnifies His splendor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble</b><p>Precious stones and marble speak of stability and majesty (<a href="/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12</a>). Marble foundations foreshadow the &#8220;living stones&#8221; God is building into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). The earthly temple points forward to a greater, eternal dwelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all in abundance</b><p>David&#8217;s generosity overflows, echoing God&#8217;s own abundant grace (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7-8</a>). The phrase mirrors Jesus&#8217; promise in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>: &#8220;a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.&#8221; Liberality opens the door for God-sized work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> shows King David pouring every resource&#8212;skill, wealth, and will&#8212;into preparing God&#8217;s temple. His ordered list moves from the most precious to the most common, demonstrating that all materials, like all people, find purpose when devoted to the Lord. David&#8217;s abundance reflects confident faith: God is worthy of excellence, and His people respond by giving their all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Now I have prepared.</span>--<span class= "ital">And with all might have I prepared</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-14.htm" title="Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.">1Chronicles 22:14</a>; comp. also <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-9.htm" title="The LORD shall establish you an holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in his ways.">Deuteronomy 28:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The gold for things to be made of gold.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the gold for the gold, and the silver for the silver,</span> &c.
