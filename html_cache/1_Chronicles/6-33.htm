The Levites were set apart for service to God, and their duties were often passed down through generations. This reflects the importance of family and tradition in maintaining the worship practices of Israel. The concept of serving "together with their sons" highlights the communal and familial aspect of worship, ensuring continuity and stability in the religious practices of the Israelites.<p><b>From the Kohathites:</b><br>The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descended from Kohath, the second son of Levi. They were responsible for the most sacred aspects of the tabernacle service, including the care of the Ark of the Covenant and other holy furnishings. This role underscores the Kohathites' significant responsibility and privilege in the religious life of Israel. Their duties required a high level of sanctity and reverence, as they were directly involved with the most sacred objects of worship.<p><b>Heman the singer,</b><br>Heman is identified as a prominent musician and singer in the temple service. He is often associated with the Psalms and is credited with contributing to the musical worship of Israel. His role as a singer indicates the importance of music in worship, serving as a means to glorify God and lead the congregation in praise. Heman's position also suggests a high level of skill and dedication, as music was a central element of temple worship.<p><b>the son of Joel,</b><br>Joel, Heman's father, is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of Levitical service. This connection emphasizes the hereditary nature of the Levitical roles and the importance of maintaining a pure lineage for those who served in the temple. The mention of Joel situates Heman within a specific family line, highlighting the continuity of service and the passing down of responsibilities from one generation to the next.<p><b>the son of Samuel,</b><br>Samuel, the prophet and last judge of Israel, is a significant figure in biblical history. His inclusion in Heman's genealogy underscores the spiritual heritage and authority associated with Heman's family. Samuel's role as a prophet and leader of Israel adds a layer of prestige and spiritual depth to Heman's lineage. This connection also highlights the intertwining of prophetic and priestly roles in Israel's history, as Samuel was instrumental in guiding the nation and establishing the monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heman_the_singer.htm">Heman the Singer</a></b><br>A prominent figure in the Levitical choir, Heman was a musician and singer in the temple.

Scripture&#8217;s literal record reminds us that God values visible, practical faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>together with their sons</b><p>Generational language underscores covenant continuity.

They carried the most sacred furnishings&#8212;the ark, the table, the lampstand&#8212;signifying intimacy with holy things. By naming Kohathites here, the chronicler anchors temple music to the clan already trusted with the ark (<a href="/joshua/21-4.htm">Joshua 21:4-5</a>). Worship and holiness remain inseparable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Heman the singer</b><p>Heman emerges as chief musician. Earlier, David &#8220;appointed Heman &#8230; to sound aloud with cymbals&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>), and later &#8220;Heman was the king&#8217;s seer&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>). He helps lead the worship that brings God&#8217;s glory cloud to the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12-14</a>). Tradition ties <a href="/bsb/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a> to Heman, showing that worship can be honest, even lamenting, yet still God-honoring. His title &#8220;the singer&#8221; affirms that music is ministry, not mere art.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Joel</b><p>Joel, though lesser-known, stands as a link between the prophet Samuel and Heman. <a href="/1_samuel/8-2.htm">1 Samuel 8:2</a> names Joel as Samuel&#8217;s firstborn who judged Beersheba. Though Joel&#8217;s sons faltered (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>), God&#8217;s grace redeems the line: from Joel&#8217;s household arises Heman, a faithful worship leader. Genealogies record both flaws and future hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Samuel</b><p>Samuel was Israel&#8217;s final judge and a prophet who heard God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19-21</a>). By tracing Heman back to Samuel, the chronicler connects prophetic authority with temple praise. <a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a> testifies to Samuel&#8217;s intercessory stature; the same family now intercedes through song. The verse assures readers that authentic worship flows from a life rooted in God&#8217;s Word and history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a> reminds us that temple worship is no random talent show; it is a God-ordained, generational, and holy service carried out by specific people in a specific lineage. The Kohathite Heman, grandson of Samuel, carries forward prophetic passion into musical praise, demonstrating that when families honor their calling, God receives ordered, heartfelt worship that echoes through the ages.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">And these are they that waited</span> <span class= "bld">(<span class= "ital">stood</span>)</span> <span class= "bld">with their children.</span>--The main sentence which began at <a href="/1_chronicles/6-31.htm" title="And these are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of the LORD, after that the ark had rest.">1Chronicles 6:31</a>, and was suspended by the parenthetic <a href="/1_chronicles/6-32.htm" title="And they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing, until Solomon had built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem: and then they waited on their office according to their order.">1Chronicles 6:32</a>, is now resumed.

So the place of Heman was still the place of honor, in the centre, with Asaph on the right and Ethan on the left (vers. 39, 44). <span class="cmt_word">Heman</span> is the twenty-first according to this list (vers. 33-38) after Levi, but the genealogy is indistinct (see above, vers. 22-28) between <span class="cmt_word">Shemuel</span> and Assir, and according to Hervey ('Genealogies of our Lord,' p. 214), Heman comes fourteenth after Levi. This Heman is to be distinguished from Heman the "son of Zerah" (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>), and with but little doubt, therefore, from Heman the Ezrahite (Zerahite) of <a href="/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>. On the other hand, a theory has been suggested by Lord Arthur C. Hervey which might reconcile the two. He supposes that if Heman the Kohathite (or his father) had married an heiress of the house of Zerah, he might have become reckoned in the line of Zerah as well as in that of Kohath. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
