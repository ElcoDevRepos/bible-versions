This highlights the importance of family lineage in the genealogies of 1 Chronicles, which trace the descendants of the tribes of Israel. The genealogies serve to establish the historical and covenantal continuity of God's people. Shammai is a name that appears in various contexts in the Old Testament, often associated with the tribe of Judah, emphasizing the tribe's prominence in Israel's history.<p><b>Jether and Jonathan:</b><br>Jether and Jonathan are the sons of Jada, and their mention underscores the chronicler's intent to document the descendants of Judah meticulously. The name Jether appears elsewhere in the Bible, sometimes associated with individuals of significance, such as Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, though they are not the same person. Jonathan is a common name in the Old Testament, most notably associated with Jonathan, the son of King Saul and friend of David, which may reflect the name's popularity and the cultural practice of naming children after notable figures.<p><b>Jether died without children:</b><br>The fact that Jether died without children is significant in the context of ancient Israelite culture, where lineage and inheritance were crucial. Dying childless could affect the inheritance rights and the continuation of a family line, which was a matter of great concern in biblical times. This detail may also serve to highlight the importance of Jonathan's line, as Jether's lack of descendants would mean that any familial legacy would continue through Jonathan. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence in maintaining the lineage of His people, often against human expectations or norms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jada.htm">Jada</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Judah, Jada is noted as the brother of Shammai.

Naming children was a testimony to God&#8217;s ongoing faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their appearance secures Jada&#8217;s place in Judah&#8217;s lineage, paralleling other two-son pairings that frame pivotal moments in biblical history&#8212;e.g., Esau & Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) and Perez & Zerah (<a href="/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; Though little else is recorded, their inclusion illustrates that every life, noted or not, is seen by God (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jether died without children</b><p>&#8226; The Chronicler adds, &#8220;Jether died without children&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-32.htm">1 Chronicles 2:32</a>). Such detail matters because lack of offspring could sever a family&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement validates legal provisions like levirate marriage (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5&#8211;10</a>) and signals why Jonathan&#8217;s line, not Jether&#8217;s, would carry Jada&#8217;s heritage forward (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-33.htm">1 Chronicles 2:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the note cautions against presuming on future generations; only the Lord sustains a family&#8217;s legacy (<a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-32.htm">1 Chronicles 2:32</a> records Jada&#8217;s two sons, notes his relation to Shammai, and states that Jether left no heirs.
