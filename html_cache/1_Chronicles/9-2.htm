The resettlement signifies a restoration of the covenant relationship with God, as the land was a key component of the promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The return to their cities underscores the importance of tribal and familial inheritance in Israelite society, as land was distributed according to tribes and families (Joshua 13-21). This resettlement is a fulfillment of prophetic promises, such as those found in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, where God promises to bring His people back after 70 years of exile.<p><b>were Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants</b><br>The mention of these groups highlights the reestablishment of religious and social order in post-exilic Israel. The Israelites represent the general population, while the priests and Levites are specifically tasked with religious duties. The priests, descendants of Aaron, were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals (Exodus 28-29). The Levites, from the tribe of Levi, assisted the priests and had roles in teaching the law and leading worship (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). The temple servants, or Nethinim, were a group assigned to assist the Levites in the more menial tasks of temple service (<a href="/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43-54</a>). This structure points to the centrality of worship and the temple in the life of Israel, foreshadowing the ultimate priesthood of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends these roles (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were God's chosen people.

Authorities are very divided as to whether this expression describes inhabitants of the land before the Captivity or subsequent to it. Almost all the older authorities, and Keil amongst those of more modern date, take the former position; Movers, Bertheau, and others take the latter, as also Canon Rawlinson ('Speaker's Commentary,' 3:157, 211). It must be admitted that there is some obscurity, and which accounts for the contrariety of opinion. But obscurity and contrariety notwithstanding, a comparison of vers. 2 and 3 with <a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a>: produces two impressions almost irresistible, viz. that the difficulty is occasioned by some comparatively slight corruption or mutilation in our ver. 2; and that, whatever the reference is in <a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a> (and there is no ambiguity there), that it is in the present passage.

Not before the time of the return does the name Nethinim seem to have crystallized upon this class of helpers, the explanation of which may possibly be that their numbers and their services then became so much more necessary.
