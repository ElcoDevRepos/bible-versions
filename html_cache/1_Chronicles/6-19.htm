The Levites were set apart for religious duties, and Merari's descendants were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's structural components, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This role highlights the importance of organization and support within the worship practices of Israel, emphasizing the need for a strong foundation in both physical and spiritual aspects of worship.<p><b>Mahli and Mushi:</b><br>Mahli and Mushi were the two sons of Merari. Their names are often mentioned in genealogical records, underscoring the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society. Mahli's descendants are noted in other parts of the Bible, such as in the book of Ezra, where they are involved in the return from Babylonian exile. This connection illustrates the continuity of God's promises and the faithfulness of the Levites in maintaining their duties across generations.<p><b>These are the clans of the Levites:</b><br>The Levites were divided into clans based on their ancestral lines from Levi's three sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Each clan had specific responsibilities related to the tabernacle and later the temple. This division of labor reflects the organized structure God established for worship and service, ensuring that each task was performed by those specifically appointed and trained for it.<p><b>Listed according to their fathers:</b><br>Genealogies were crucial in ancient Israel for establishing identity, inheritance rights, and fulfilling religious duties. The Levites' genealogical records were particularly important because their service in the temple was hereditary. This phrase emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with the Levites and the importance of maintaining a clear record of lineage to ensure the proper fulfillment of their sacred duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/merari.htm">Merari</a></b><br>One of the three sons of Levi, Merari is the patriarch of the Merarite clan.
