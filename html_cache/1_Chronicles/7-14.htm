His descendants were part of the half-tribe that settled on the east side of the Jordan River. This phrase highlights the continuation of Joseph's lineage and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants. The tribe of Manasseh played a significant role in the history of Israel, often associated with military prowess and territorial expansion.<p><b>Asriel through his Aramean concubine:</b><br>Asriel is identified as a descendant of Manasseh, born through an Aramean concubine. This indicates a blending of cultures and peoples, as Arameans were a Semitic people living in the region of modern-day Syria. The mention of a concubine reflects the social and familial structures of the time, where concubinage was a common practice for expanding family lines and alliances. This also shows the integration of non-Israelite elements into the Israelite community, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>She also gave birth to Machir the father of Gilead:</b><br>Machir is a significant figure as he is recognized as the father of Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River known for its balm and rugged terrain. The Gileadites were known for their valor and were often involved in the defense and expansion of Israelite territory. This lineage emphasizes the importance of Machir's descendants in the tribal and military history of Israel. The connection to Gilead also has prophetic undertones, as the region is mentioned in various prophecies and is symbolic of healing and restoration in the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Joseph, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

She also gave birth to Machir the father of Gilead.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>)<p>&#8226; This verse anchors us in the larger genealogical record of <a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-19</a>, tracing the line of Joseph&#8217;s son Manasseh (see <a href="/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents these lists not as dry facts but as milestones of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. The tribe of Manasseh received territory on both sides of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-6</a>), fulfilling the promise first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Each name marks God&#8217;s ongoing preservation of His people, preparing the stage for later leaders from Manasseh such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-15</a>) and King Hezekiah&#8217;s mother, Abijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-1.htm">2 Chronicles 29:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Asriel through his Aramean concubine</b><p>&#8226; Asriel is identified as the son born &#8220;through his Aramean concubine,&#8221; highlighting Manasseh&#8217;s relationship with a woman of Aramean (Syrian) descent. Similar cross-cultural unions appear elsewhere (e.g., Joseph&#8217;s Egyptian wife in <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The Chronicler includes this detail to show that God&#8217;s purposes move forward even amid unexpected family dynamics. Despite imperfect circumstances, God weaves every thread into His redemptive plan (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Asriel&#8217;s descendants, called the Asrielites (<a href="/numbers/26-31.htm">Numbers 26:31</a>), belonged to the half-tribe of Manasseh that settled east of the Jordan, illustrating how one branch of the family grew into a recognized clan within Israel&#8217;s structure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She also gave birth to Machir</b><p>&#8226; Machir stands out prominently. He was the firstborn of Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>).<p>&#8226; His mother&#8217;s Aramean background did not disqualify Machir from full tribal inheritance. This reflects God&#8217;s pattern of grace overriding human boundaries (<a href="/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Machir&#8217;s own sons later engage in conquest and settlement, securing regions that become vital to Israel&#8217;s future (<a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Machir the father of Gilead</b><p>&#8226; Machir fathers Gilead, whose name becomes synonymous with the entire territory east of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39-40</a>).<p>&#8226; The land of Gilead grows into a strategic frontier for Israel, hosting prophets like Elijah the Tishbite (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>) and offering refuge cities such as Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>).<p>&#8226; By tracing Gilead back to Machir, Scripture ties Israel&#8217;s geography to its genealogy, reminding readers that the land allocations were not random but flowed from God-ordained family lines (<a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a> affirms that God faithfully multiplied Manasseh&#8217;s line&#8212;through Asriel, Machir, and Gilead&#8212;despite unconventional family origins. Each name links God&#8217;s covenant promises to real people, real places, and real outcomes. The verse underscores that the Lord&#8217;s redemptive plan moves forward through ordinary families, cross-cultural unions, and territorial inheritances, all perfectly woven into His larger story of salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The sons of Manasseh.</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">the sons</span> <span class= "ital">of Manasseh, Asriel, whom his Aramean concubine bare. </span>(<span class= "ital">She bare Machir, father of Gilead.</span>) <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1</a>, <a href="/joshua/17-3.htm" title="But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.">Joshua 17:3</a>, give the line<p>Zelophehad has five daughters, but no sons. <a href="/context/numbers/26-29.htm" title="Of the sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites: and Machir begat Gilead: of Gilead come the family of the Gileadites.">Numbers 26:29-33</a> gives the same line with additions thus:--<p>This last passage is important, because it expressly declares that the names all represent clans, with the exception of Zelophehad, who "had no sons, but daughters." It also shows that Asriel was great-grandson of Manasseh. The parenthesis of <a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm" title="The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bore: (but his concubine the Aramitess bore Machir the father of Gilead:">1Chronicles 7:14</a>, therefore, appears to be intended to warn the reader that Asriel was the "son" of the Aramean concubine of Manasseh, mediately through descent from Machir.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Manasseh</span>. The tribe of Manasseh has been partly treated of in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23-26</a>, viz. those of the tribe who inhabited Gilead and Bashan. Here those who inhabited this side Jordan are treated cf. And it is very difficult to give any coherent account of the differences of this passage when compared with <a href="/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28-34</a> and <a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-4</a>. In these places six families, or heads of families, are noted to only two, or at most three here, viz. Askriel, Shemida, and perhaps Abiezer (<span class="accented">iq.</span> Jeezer, <a href="/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>; comp. with <a href="/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>). The opening clause of this verse also is unmanageable as it stands. One way of reducing it to coherence would be to Supply the words "his wife" between whom and bars, the similarity of the Hebrew letters of which to those of the Hebrew for "whom" might possibly account for the loss of it. The parenthesis about the concubine would then read with emphasis. But there is not the slightest reason to suppose there was such a wife. Another way would be to read the concubine as the mother of Ashriel, and prefix a conjunction, and, to the second "bare;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and she bare, or, she bare also Machir." But it seems pretty plain from Numbers and Joshua that Ashriel was not strictly a son, but only descendant of Manasseh; and, further, the irresistible impression is that Machir was the only son, strictly speaking (see especially <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). The position of Ashriel in our present passage, first, is also very unsatisfactory in face of <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a> and the other references already given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Manasseh:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;na&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4519.htm">Strong's 4519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manasseh -- 'causing to forget', a son of Joseph, also a king of Judah, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Through his Aramean</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;ram&#183;m&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
