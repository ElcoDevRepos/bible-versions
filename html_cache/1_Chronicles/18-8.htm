This area was known for its wealth and strategic importance. Hadadezer was a powerful king who opposed David's expansion. The mention of these cities highlights David's military success and God's favor in granting him victory over formidable enemies. The conquest of these cities signifies the extension of Israel's influence and the fulfillment of God's promise to give David rest from his enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>).<p><b>David took a large amount of bronze</b><br>Bronze was a valuable resource in the ancient world, used for making weapons, tools, and various artifacts. The acquisition of a large amount of bronze from these cities indicates the wealth and resources David accumulated through his military campaigns. This wealth was not for personal gain but was dedicated to the service of God, as seen in its later use by Solomon. The gathering of materials for the temple foreshadows the future peace and prosperity under Solomon's reign, a time when the temple would be built as a permanent dwelling place for God's presence among His people.<p><b>with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles</b><br>The bronze Sea, pillars, and other articles were significant components of Solomon's Temple, symbolizing God's majesty and the centrality of worship in Israel's life. The bronze Sea was a large basin used by the priests for ceremonial washing, representing purification and readiness to serve God. The pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, stood at the entrance of the temple, symbolizing stability and strength. These items reflect the glory and splendor of the temple, which was a type of Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The temple's construction fulfilled God's promise to David that his son would build a house for His name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus, who establishes an eternal kingdom and mediates God's presence to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military conquests and his heart for God.

By naming them, the chronicler underlines how specific and tangible God&#8217;s victories for David were&#8212;real places, real spoils. Just as God had promised Abraham territory (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18&#8211;21</a>), here we see land and resources actually changing hands. The mention reminds us that none of God&#8217;s promises drift in abstraction; He works in identifiable history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>cities of Hadadezer</b><p>Hadadezer, king of Zobah, was a formidable enemy (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3&#8211;4</a>).

Repeated references (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3&#8211;4</a>) emphasize that every foe, however strong, must yield when God fights for His people (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David took a large amount of bronze</b><p>&#8226; Earlier, David dedicated spoils of war to the Lord (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-11.htm">1 Chronicles 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The abundance of bronze anticipates future temple worship, showing David&#8217;s forward-looking heart even though he would not build the temple himself (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The haul illustrates <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;A good man leaves an inheritance to his children&#8217;s children&#8221;&#8212;here, spiritual and material resources for Solomon&#8217;s use.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with which Solomon made the bronze Sea</b><p>The &#8220;Sea,&#8221; a vast basin for priestly washing (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-2.htm">2 Chronicles 4:2&#8211;5</a>), symbolizes cleansing before approaching God.

The verse reminds us that every victory, resource, and season of life can&#8212;and should&#8212;be redirected toward God&#8217;s glory and the building up of His dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Tibhath, and . . .

It is now called a sea, because of its large size. The use of the original laver is plainly told, for the priests to wash at it their hands and feet before offering sacrifices. It stood in the court of the tabernacle, between the altar and the door. The ten lavers of Solomon's temple were used for washing the sacrificial victims themselves (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>). The brazen sea (which was rather of <span class="accented">copper</span> than brass, however) rested upon twelve standing oxen, three turning their faces to each quarter of the heavens. Its height was five cubits, its diameter ten cubits, the thickness of its metal a handbreadth, and its capacity variously given at two thousand baths (<a href="/1_kings/7-26.htm">1 Kings 7:26</a>) or three thousand (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>). It was removed from its supports of oxen by Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>), and placed on a pedestal of stone. And it was eventually destroyed by the Assyrians (<a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13</a>). <span class="accented">And the pillars.</span> (For these pillars of the porch, named <span class="accented">Jachin</span> and <span class="accented">Boaz</span>, see <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>;
