The involvement of relatives suggests a tradition of passing down musical skills and responsibilities within families. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. The inclusion of relatives also emphasizes the importance of community in worship, a principle that is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the early church's communal life (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<p><b>who were all trained and skillful</b><br>The emphasis on being "trained and skillful" indicates a high standard for those involved in temple worship. This training likely involved both musical ability and spiritual preparation, underscoring the importance of excellence in worship. The Levites, who were responsible for temple music, were set apart for this purpose, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16-22</a>. This dedication to skill and training can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament call for believers to use their gifts for the edification of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).<p><b>in the songs of the LORD</b><br>The "songs of the LORD" refer to the sacred music used in temple worship, which was an integral part of Israel's religious life. These songs were likely psalms and hymns that praised God and recounted His mighty deeds. The Psalms, many of which are attributed to David, were central to worship and are still used in Jewish and Christian liturgies today. This phrase underscores the role of music in expressing devotion and theology, a tradition that continues in Christian worship through hymns and spiritual songs (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<p><b>they numbered 288</b><br>The specific number, 288, indicates an organized and structured approach to temple worship. This number could represent 24 groups of 12 musicians, aligning with the 24 divisions of priests and Levites mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>. This organization reflects the orderliness of worship in the temple, which was designed to reflect the holiness and majesty of God. The precision in numbers also points to the importance of each individual's contribution to the collective worship experience, a principle that is mirrored in the New Testament's teaching on the body of Christ, where each member has a unique and vital role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/singers_and_musicians.htm">Singers and Musicians</a></b><br>This verse refers to the group of Levites who were specifically set apart for the ministry of music in the temple.

Worship in Israel was never a solo endeavor; it was rooted in covenant community. David deliberately organized &#8220;the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun&#8221; along with their kin (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Family participation guarded purity of doctrine and practice (De 6:6-7; <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Unity among relatives modeled the very praise they were leading&#8212;&#8220;How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes this corporate pattern: households such as Cornelius&#8217;s and Lydia&#8217;s rejoiced together in the Lord (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24</a>; 16:15, 34).<p>Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we may trust that these relatives truly stood side-by-side in the sanctuary, strengthening one another and setting an example for every generation that follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were all trained</b><p>Training was not optional; it was expected. These Levites had been prepared for their calling, just as Chenaniah earlier &#8220;instructed about the songs, because he was skillful&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-22.htm">1 Chronicles 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Thorough instruction protected worship from careless improvisation (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Training involved mind and heart: &#8220;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God&#8221; (2 <a href="/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The church today still equips servants &#8220;for works of ministry, to build up the body of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>).<p>God values deliberate preparation. Talent alone is never enough; disciplined learning turns giftedness into holy service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and skillful in the songs of the LORD</b><p>Skillfulness matters because God is worthy of our best. &#8220;Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Musical excellence lifted Israel&#8217;s eyes from performers to the LORD Himself (<a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; These songs were Scripture-saturated prophecy (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a>), reinforcing truth while stirring affection.<p>&#8226; Skill is commended, never worshiped. The focus remains &#8220;the songs of the LORD,&#8221; not the virtuosity of the Levites (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p>By recording this detail, the chronicler affirms that artistry and orthodoxy can&#8212;and must&#8212;walk together in the worship of the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they numbered 288</b><p>The final clause underscores order. Two hundred eighty-eight equals twenty-four courses of twelve each (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Twenty-four divisions parallel the priestly courses in the prior chapter (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-4.htm">1 Chronicles 24:4</a>), showing symmetry in Israel&#8217;s worship structure.<p>&#8226; Twelve signifies completeness within each group, mirroring the twelve tribes (<a href="/exodus/28-21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>; <a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Precise numbers testify to the historical reliability of the account; they are not symbolic legends but factual records.<p>God delights in orderly service: &#8220;Let everything be done decently and in order&#8221; (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 14</a>:40). Organization safeguards continuity so that praise never ceases before His throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a> presents a snapshot of divinely ordered worship: families united, thoroughly trained, artistically skillful, and numerically organized. The verse calls believers today to serve together, prepare diligently, offer excellence, and embrace godly structure&#8212;because the Lord who inspired these words is worthy of nothing less.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">So the number of them, with their brethren . . . was two hundred fourscore and eight.</span>--This total of two hundred and eighty-eight skilled musicians (24 ? 12) shows that each of the twenty-four leading minstrels, called in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/25-2.htm" title="Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.">1Chronicles 25:2-4</a> the "sons" of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, was associated with a company of eleven "brethren," who were experts in the chanting of the sanctuary. The twenty-four leaders accompanied the singing of their choirs with instrumental music.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - This verse introduces a large additional number of those called for the present brethren of the foregoing twenty-four. These brethren (partly composed of their <span class="accented">sons</span>, as appears from vers. 9-31) were to aid in the songs of the Lord, and were apparently under instruction for that purpose. Each one of the twenty-four had eleven associated subordinates with him, and for whose instruction and service he was probably answerable. These would, of course, multiply up to the <span class="cmt_word">two hundred four score and eight</span> mentioned in the verse. This verse appears (contrary to the interpretation of Keil, Bertheau, and others) with sufficient precision to mark <span class="accented">two</span> classes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, the latter <span class="accented">not</span> embracing the former, but the two together making up the two hundred and eighty-eight spoken cf. These two classes will surely satisfy the "teacher and the scholar" classification of the following verse; the classes are denoted by the same Hebrew roots. In ver. 7 the passive Pual participle of the instructed and the Hiphil participle of the cunning, or skilled, correspond exactly with the "scholar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) and the "teacher" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) of ver. 8. The contents of vers. 9-31 point to the same, being as they are without an allusion to any other outsiders - to any but the already introduced names of "sons" and "brethren." The supposing, therefore, of any allusion here to the "four thousand" of <a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> seems unnecessary and unnatural in whatever way they were distributed - and probably enough it was in an analogous manner - no distinct reference is made to them here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Together with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their relatives,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
