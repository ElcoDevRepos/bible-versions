In the biblical context, the act of sleeping with one's wife is often associated with the fulfillment of God's command to be fruitful and multiply (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). It also reflects the intimacy and covenantal bond within marriage, as seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>and she conceived and gave birth to a son.</b><br>The conception and birth of a son are significant in the biblical narrative, often seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). Sons were particularly valued in ancient Israelite culture for carrying on the family name and inheritance. This event follows a period of mourning for Ephraim, suggesting a renewal of hope and continuation of his lineage.<p><b>So he named him Beriah,</b><br>Naming in the Bible often carries deep significance, reflecting circumstances of birth or prophetic insights. The name "Beriah" is derived from a root meaning "in trouble" or "misfortune," indicating the context of his birth. Names in Scripture frequently reveal character or destiny, as seen with figures like Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<p><b>because tragedy had come upon his house.</b><br>This phrase refers to the earlier tragedy where Ephraim's sons were killed by the men of Gath (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a>). The naming of Beriah serves as a memorial to this sorrowful event.

Scripture shows a pattern in which marital intimacy, even after deep sorrow, is God&#8217;s means of renewing life and hope (see <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>, where David comforts Bathsheba and Solomon is conceived). Here, Ephraim refuses to let grief have the last word; he embraces the covenant privilege of marriage, trusting God to restore what was lost. This action underscores the literal, historical rhythm of life the genealogies record.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she conceived and gave birth to a son</b><p>Just as God had promised fruitfulness to Jacob&#8217;s family line (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>), the conception of this child testifies that God&#8217;s blessing is still operative despite tragedy. Similar flashes of new life follow loss elsewhere&#8212;Eve conceiving Seth after Abel&#8217;s death (<a href="/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>) and Ruth bearing Obed after Naomi&#8217;s devastation (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-17</a>). The chronicler includes this detail not as a minor footnote but as living proof that the Lord keeps multiplying His people exactly as He said He would (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he named him Beriah</b><p>Names in Scripture often capture the spiritual temperature of a moment. &#8220;Beriah&#8221; sounds like the Hebrew for &#8220;misfortune,&#8221; signaling that Ephraim memorializes both pain and providence in one word. Joseph did something similar when he named his sons Manasseh and Ephraim to mark past suffering and future fruitfulness (<a href="/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51-52</a>). By naming the boy Beriah, Ephraim both acknowledges the wound and bears witness that God is still writing the family story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because tragedy had come upon his house</b><p>The &#8220;tragedy&#8221; refers to the killing of Ephraim&#8217;s earlier sons by the men of Gath (1 Chron 7:21). This loss parallels other national sorrows&#8212;such as the capture of the ark when Phinehas&#8217;s wife named her child Ichabod, saying &#8220;The glory has departed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>). Yet Chronicles places the grief inside a genealogy that ultimately leads to Joshua (<a href="/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>; 1 Chron 7:27), the conqueror who would bring Israel into the land. Even unthinkable disaster cannot derail God&#8217;s covenant trajectory; instead, it becomes a dark backdrop against which His faithfulness shines brighter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/7-23.htm">1 Chronicles 7:23</a> records a literal event in Ephraim&#8217;s life: following a crushing family loss, he comforts his wife, God grants another son, and the couple names him Beriah to mark their sorrow. The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s design for marriage continues to be fruitful even after heartbreak.<p>&#8226; New life is His gracious answer to human grief.<p>&#8226; Naming can memorialize pain yet still testify to hope.<p>&#8226; No tragedy, however severe, cancels God&#8217;s covenant purposes for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Because it went evil.</span>--Beriah is derived from a root, <span class= "ital">bara',</span> and apparently means <span class= "ital">gift.</span> Heb., <span class= "ital">because in evil it </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the birth of Beriah) <span class= "ital">happened in his house.</span> There is an allusive play on the words <span class= "ital">Beriah</span> ("gift") and <span class= "ital">bera'ah</span> ("in evil") such as we often meet with in Genesis (see <a href="/genesis/5-29.htm" title="And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed.">Genesis 5:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-9.htm" title="Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from there did the LORD scatter them abroad on the face of all the earth.">Genesis 11:9</a>).
