His role was crucial in maintaining the priestly lineage and duties as outlined in the Mosaic Law. Eleazar's leadership is noted during the Israelites' wilderness journey and in the distribution of the land in Canaan (<a href="/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a>). His name means "God has helped," reflecting his role in guiding Israel with divine assistance. Phinehas, his son, is renowned for his zealous act in stopping a plague among the Israelites by executing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman who were defying God's commands (<a href="/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>). This act of zeal earned Phinehas a covenant of peace and a perpetual priesthood, highlighting the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God.<p><b>Phinehas was the father of Abishua</b><br>Phinehas's legacy continued through his son Abishua, who is less prominently mentioned in the biblical narrative. The name Abishua means "father of salvation," which can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate salvation brought through Jesus Christ. The genealogical record here emphasizes the continuity of the priestly line, which was essential for maintaining the religious and cultural identity of Israel. This lineage is significant as it underscores the fulfillment of God's promises to maintain a priesthood that would serve Him and mediate for the people. The priestly line from Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas to Abishua is a testament to God's faithfulness in preserving His chosen leaders for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar.htm">Eleazar</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, Eleazar served as a high priest after the death of his father.

It has been pointed out by Lord A. C. Hervey that the name Jehozadak is of the same meaning with Zedekiah, the last king before the Captivity; and that Jeshua is the same in meaning with Joshua, the leader of the tribes into Canaan.
