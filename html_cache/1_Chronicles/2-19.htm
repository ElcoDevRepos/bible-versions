In biblical times, the death of a spouse was a significant event, often leading to changes in family dynamics and responsibilities. The mention of Azubah's death highlights the importance of lineage and the continuation of family lines in Israelite culture. The name Azubah means "forsaken" or "desolate," which may reflect her untimely death or a period of barrenness before her passing.<p><b>Caleb married Ephrath</b><br>Caleb, a prominent figure in the tribe of Judah, is known for his faithfulness and courage, particularly during the exploration of Canaan (Numbers 13-14). His marriage to Ephrath signifies a new chapter in his life. Ephrath is often associated with Bethlehem, as seen in other biblical references (<a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>, <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), suggesting a connection to this significant location in Israel's history. The name Ephrath means "fruitful," which contrasts with Azubah's name and foreshadows the continuation of Caleb's lineage.<p><b>who bore to him Hur</b><br>Hur is an important figure in the biblical narrative, often associated with leadership and support roles. He is mentioned alongside Aaron in supporting Moses during the battle against the Amalekites (<a href="/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10-12</a>). This connection to leadership and support roles may indicate the qualities valued in Caleb's family. Hur's lineage is significant, as he is considered an ancestor of Bezalel, the chief artisan of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>), highlighting the family's contribution to Israel's spiritual heritage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azubah.htm">Azubah</a></b><br>The first wife of Caleb, whose death is mentioned in this verse. Her name means "forsaken" or "deserted" in Hebrew, which may reflect her untimely death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb.htm">Caleb</a></b><br>A prominent figure in the tribe of Judah, known for his faithfulness and courage. He is often associated with the conquest of Canaan and is a descendant of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephrath.htm">Ephrath</a></b><br>The second wife of Caleb, who bore him a son named Hur.

Believers are encouraged to remain steadfast in faith during life's changes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_lineage.htm">Legacy and Lineage</a></b><br>The mention of Hur highlights the importance of legacy.
