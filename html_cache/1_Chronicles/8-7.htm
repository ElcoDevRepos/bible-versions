Naaman and Ahijah are not widely mentioned elsewhere, but Gera is noted as an ancestor of Ehud, the judge who delivered Israel from Moabite oppression (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>). This connection highlights the ongoing influence of Benjamin's descendants in Israel's leadership and deliverance narratives.<p><b>who carried them into exile</b><br>This phrase suggests a forced relocation, possibly during a time of conflict or conquest. The context of exile in the Old Testament often refers to the Babylonian captivity, but this specific reference may indicate a smaller, localized event. Exile was a common consequence of war in the ancient Near East, often resulting in the displacement of populations to weaken resistance and assimilate conquered peoples.<p><b>and who was the father of Uzza and Ahihud</b><br>Uzza and Ahihud are lesser-known figures, but their mention here serves to continue the genealogical record of Benjamin.

His presence keeps the genealogy three-fold, echoing a familiar triad pattern in Scripture (e.g., Noah&#8217;s three sons in <a href="/genesis/6-10.htm">Genesis 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Although Chronicles does not add detail about this specific Ahijah, the name appears elsewhere for notable Benjamites (<a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>). The shared name reminds us that God often raises leaders from the same tribal roots, demonstrating continuity of His call.<p>&#8226; Listing him here verifies that Ehud&#8217;s family produced multiple branches, fulfilling the blessing of fruitfulness given to Israel&#8217;s tribes (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gera</b><p>&#8226; Gera is both brother and, by the phrase that follows, an acting patriarch: &#8220;Gera, who carried them into exile and who was the father of Uzza and Ahihud.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier Scripture calls the judge Ehud &#8220;the son of Gera&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>). Chronicles flips the order, showing that names repeated across generations and that families were tightly woven.<p>&#8226; By highlighting Gera, the writer signals that even lesser-known figures took decisive action that shaped the clan&#8217;s future, echoing how God uses ordinary people for pivotal moments (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who carried them into exile</b><p>&#8226; The clause links Gera to a forced relocation from Geba to Manahath (noted in 1 Chron 8:6). This appears to be an internal exile&#8212;probably due to pressure from neighboring peoples or shifts in territorial boundaries (cf. <a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a> for Geba&#8217;s location).<p>&#8226; Scripture often records such displacements to show that God disciplines yet preserves His people (2 Chron 36:15-21). Even a local exile fits the broader biblical pattern: movement, loss, and eventual restoration (<a href="/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds readers that no exile&#8212;large or small&#8212;lies outside God&#8217;s sovereign oversight (<a href="/isaiah/45-13.htm">Isaiah 45:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who was the father of Uzza and Ahihud</b><p>&#8226; The genealogy continues through Gera&#8217;s sons Uzza and Ahihud, ensuring the line does not end with exile.<p>&#8226; Uzza (&#8220;strength&#8221;) later appears as a Levitical gatekeeper (1 Chron 26:11), while Ahihud (&#8220;my brother is majesty&#8221;) shows up in the territorial allotments of Naphtali (<a href="/numbers/34-27.htm">Numbers 34:27</a>). Though those references involve different men, the recurrence of the names hints that family memories were kept alive across tribes and centuries.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness is underscored: even after upheaval, new generations stand ready to serve (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-7.htm">1 Chronicles 8:7</a> underscores that God tracks every family line, even amid displacement. Naaman, Ahijah, and Gera mark three branches from Ehud; Gera&#8217;s action of relocating the clan does not break the line but leads to the birth of Uzza and Ahihud. The verse testifies that, whether in stability or exile, the Lord preserves His people and keeps His promises to the tribe of Benjamin and to all Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them.</span>--The three clans here mentioned are commonly regarded as the authors of the expatriation of the people of Geba. Of Gera it is specially said "<span class= "ital">he</span> removed them," because Gera was the leading clan of the three. According to this interpretation the two verses (6-7) may be rendered: "And these are the sons of Ehud. (These are heads of clans belonging to the inhabitants of Geba, and men carried them away to Manahath--both Naaman, and Ahijah, and Gera, he it was who carried them away.) He begat Uzza and Ahihud." That is to say, Uzza and Ahihud, two chiefs of clans settled at Geba (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-45.htm" title="The son of Hashabiah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Hilkiah,">1Chronicles 6:45</a>), were forcibly removed by three other Benjamite clans to Manahath (see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-52.htm" title="And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons;
