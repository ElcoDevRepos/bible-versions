It became the capital after David conquered it from the Jebusites. The mention of Jerusalem here emphasizes the establishment of David's dynasty in the city that would later become the site of the Temple, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<p><b>Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon:</b><br>These sons of David are significant for various reasons. Solomon is the most well-known, as he succeeded David as king and built the Temple. Nathan, though less prominent, is noteworthy because the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke traces through Nathan, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his lineage would endure forever. Shimea and Shobab are less mentioned in the biblical narrative, but their inclusion here underscores the importance of David's family line.<p><b>These four were born to him by Bathsheba daughter of Ammiel:</b><br>Bathsheba's story is complex, involving her initial relationship with David, which began in sin, yet she became a pivotal figure in the Davidic line. Her father, Ammiel, is also known as Eliam, one of David's mighty men, indicating her noble heritage. Bathsheba's role in the royal lineage is crucial, as she is the mother of Solomon, through whom the Davidic covenant is continued.
