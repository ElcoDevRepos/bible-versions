The term "mighty men of valor" is often used in the Old Testament to describe warriors of great skill and bravery, such as David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23). This valor is not only physical but also spiritual, reflecting a deep trust in God. The emphasis on valor connects to the broader biblical theme of God empowering His people to overcome their enemies.<p><b>archers</b><br>Archery was a significant military skill in ancient times, and being an archer was a mark of distinction. The Benjamites were known for their skill with the bow, as seen in <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, where they are described as left-handed slingers. This skill set them apart as formidable warriors. The use of archery in warfare required precision and discipline, qualities that were highly valued in the military context of ancient Israel.<p><b>and they had many sons and grandsons&#8212;150 in all</b><br>The large number of descendants signifies God's blessing and favor, as numerous offspring were considered a sign of divine blessing and strength (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). This multiplication of descendants also ensured the continuation and influence of the family line within the tribe of Benjamin. The specific number, 150, underscores the prosperity and growth of Ulam's lineage, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promises to multiply His people.<p><b>All these were the descendants of Benjamin</b><br>This phrase situates Ulam's family within the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

If we may assume that no names have been omitted, we are concerned with the fourteenth generation from Jonathan, the friend of David.

(1055 <span class= "ital">minus</span> 420), in the reign of Josiah. The omission of names, however, is as possible and as likely in the present series as elsewhere; and it is obvious that one or two additional members would carry the list past the exile (B.C. 588).
