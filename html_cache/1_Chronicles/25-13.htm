This order reflects a structured approach to worship, emphasizing the importance of music in temple services. The number six often symbolizes human weakness and imperfection in biblical numerology, yet here it is part of a divinely ordained order, suggesting that even human efforts can be sanctified for God's purposes. Bukkiah's name means "the Lord has proved," which may indicate a testimony of God's faithfulness in his life or lineage.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers</b><br>The inclusion of both sons and brothers highlights the familial nature of the Levitical service. This reflects the hereditary aspect of temple duties, where musical and priestly roles were often passed down through family lines. It underscores the importance of family in maintaining the worship and traditions of Israel. This familial service can be seen as a type of the unity and continuity found in the body of Christ, where spiritual gifts and callings are shared among believers.<p><b>12 in all</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout Scripture, often representing completeness or divine government, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. In this context, the number twelve may symbolize the completeness of Bukkiah's family unit in their service, suggesting that their contribution to worship was whole and sufficient. This completeness can be seen as a reflection of the order and harmony God desires in worship, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of divine order in the New Jerusalem, which is described with twelve gates and twelve foundations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bukkiah.htm">Bukkiah</a></b><br>A leader among the musicians appointed by King David for the service of song in the house of the Lord.
