Genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the historical and tribal lineage of Israel, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant with His people. Eshek, though not a prominent figure elsewhere in Scripture, is part of the broader narrative that highlights the importance of family lines in maintaining tribal identity and inheritance.<p><b>Ulam was his firstborn:</b><br>Ulam, as the firstborn, would traditionally hold a place of prominence and responsibility within the family. The firstborn often received a double portion of the inheritance and was expected to lead the family in spiritual and social matters. This reflects the cultural norms of ancient Israel, where birth order played a significant role in family dynamics. Ulam's mention here underscores the importance of maintaining the lineage and the blessings associated with the firstborn status.<p><b>Jeush second:</b><br>Jeush, the second son, is part of the continuation of Eshek's lineage. While the second son typically did not have the same rights as the firstborn, he still played a crucial role in the family's legacy. The inclusion of Jeush in the genealogy highlights the comprehensive nature of biblical records, ensuring that all members of the family are acknowledged. This reflects the biblical theme of God's attention to detail and care for each individual within His covenant community.<p><b>and Eliphelet third:</b><br>Eliphelet, the third son, completes the list of Eshek's sons. His name, meaning "God is deliverance," may reflect the faith and hope of his family in God's provision and protection. The mention of Eliphelet, despite being the youngest, indicates the value placed on each member of the family in the biblical narrative. This aligns with the broader scriptural theme that God often uses the least expected individuals to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the stories of David and other biblical figures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eshek.htm">Eshek</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Eshek is mentioned as the father of three sons.

The firstborn held leadership, inheritance rights, and responsibility for the family&#8217;s future (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; In the very next verse we learn that Ulam&#8217;s sons &#8220;were mighty men of valor, archers&#8221; (1 Chron 8:40). The strength of the line begins with the faithfulness of the firstborn.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s design for family order displays both authority and service. Just as Joseph, Samuel, and Jesus were faithful sons, Ulam&#8217;s place as firstborn highlights the expectation that leadership begins in the home (<a href="/luke/2-51.htm">Luke 2:51&#8211;52</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeush second</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Jeush second&#8221; (8:39). Scripture often notes the second son to show that blessing isn&#8217;t limited to birth order.<p>&#8226; God worked through second sons&#8212;Isaac, Jacob, and Ephraim (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>; 27:29; 48:14)&#8212;underscoring His sovereign choice.<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s simple record reminds us that every child, regardless of sequence, stands within God&#8217;s plan. No place in the family is insignificant (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eliphelet third</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And Eliphelet third&#8221; (8:39). The name reappears elsewhere among the faithful (<a href="/2_samuel/5-16.htm">2 Samuel 5:16</a>), suggesting that families reused names to honor godly heritage.<p>&#8226; Listing a third son stresses completeness within Eshek&#8217;s house. Three sons mirror other triads in Scripture that convey stability and testimony (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inclusion legitimizes their descendants&#8217; later exploits, for the chronicler roots future victories in a documented, God-ordained lineage (1 Chron 8:40).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-39.htm">1 Chronicles 8:39</a>, though brief, affirms that God tracks every branch of His people. Eshek&#8217;s sons&#8212;Ulam, Jeush, and Eliphelet&#8212;stand as literal, historical figures, positioned by the Lord for future influence.
