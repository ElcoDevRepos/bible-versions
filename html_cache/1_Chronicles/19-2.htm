Nahash, the father of Hanun, was the king of the Ammonites, a people often in conflict with Israel. The kindness Nahash showed to David is not detailed in the biblical text, but it suggests a diplomatic relationship that David sought to honor. This act of kindness can be seen as a reflection of God's covenantal faithfulness, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>So David sent messengers to console Hanun concerning his father.</b><br>Sending messengers was a common diplomatic practice in the ancient Near East, used to convey condolences or negotiate peace. This act of sending envoys highlights David's role as a king who values relationships and seeks peace with neighboring nations. The gesture of consolation aligns with the biblical call to mourn with those who mourn, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>. It also reflects the cultural importance of honoring the dead and supporting the bereaved, a practice deeply rooted in ancient Near Eastern customs.<p><b>But when David&#8217;s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,</b><br>The land of the Ammonites, located east of the Jordan River, was a region with a history of tension with Israel. The arrival of David's servants in Ammonite territory underscores the potential for misunderstanding and conflict, as seen in the subsequent verses. This moment foreshadows the suspicion and hostility that can arise even from well-intentioned actions, a recurring theme in biblical narratives. The Ammonites' reaction to David's gesture serves as a reminder of the fragile nature of human relationships and the complexities of international diplomacy in the biblical world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God and his leadership.

The instance of kindness here alluded to is not recorded. There may have been many opportunities and calls for it during David's persecuted life, and when the Ammonite king would feel a motive beyond any intrinsic goodness of heart to "show kindness" to the youth who was Saul's object of hatred. It is, however, very remarkable that we find a genuine kindliness towards David still cleaving to the succession of Ammonite kings, even after the events of this chapter (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>).
