His leadership and devotion to God are well-documented, and he is often seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the coming Messiah. This statement occurs during a pivotal moment when David is preparing to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, establishing it as the religious center of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God,</b><br>The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties. According to the Law given to Moses, only the Levites were permitted to handle the sacred objects of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). This command underscores the importance of adhering to God's instructions and the sanctity of the Ark, which symbolized God's presence among His people.<p><b>because the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine selection of the Levites for this sacred task. God's choice of the Levites is rooted in their role as mediators between God and Israel, emphasizing the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. This selection is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His right to choose those who serve Him.<p><b>and to minister before Him forever.&#8221;</b><br>The Levites' role was not only to carry the Ark but also to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, performing sacrifices and leading worship. This perpetual ministry points to the eternal nature of God's covenant with His people.

The verse teaches that worship must follow God&#8217;s pattern, leadership is God-appointed, and holiness demands obedience. When we honor God&#8217;s choices and methods, blessing replaces judgment, and His presence is rightly revered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Then.</span>--This word is here a real note of time.

Uzzah, though possibly the son of a Levite, more probably of a Hivite (<a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7, 17</a>), was not a priest, nor is there any sufficient evidence that he was a Levite; and most distinct was the order of the Law (<a href="/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51-53</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-29.htm">Numbers 3:29-32</a>; 4:15420), that "when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." So the sons of Kohath are to come to bear the sanctuary with all its sacred vessels, "but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die." Many things were allowed to be carried on waggons under the charge of the Gershonites and Merarites, but the strict contents of the sanctuary were to be borne in a specified manner by the Kohathites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1434;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one but</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Levites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hal&#183;w&#238;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
