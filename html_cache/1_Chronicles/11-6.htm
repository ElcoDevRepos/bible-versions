It reflects his leadership style and strategic thinking. David's words often carried significant weight, as he was seen as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). His leadership was crucial in uniting the tribes of Israel and establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center.<p><b>&#8220;Whoever is the first to strike down a Jebusite</b><br>The Jebusites were the original inhabitants of Jerusalem, a Canaanite tribe that had not been fully driven out during the initial conquest of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>). David's challenge to strike down a Jebusite highlights the ongoing struggle to fully possess the land God had promised to Israel. This act was not just a military conquest but also a fulfillment of God's promises to His people. The Jebusites' stronghold in Jerusalem was a significant obstacle, and David's challenge was a call to overcome this barrier.<p><b>will become chief commander.&#8221;</b><br>This promise of becoming chief commander was a significant incentive. In the ancient Near Eastern context, military leadership was a prestigious and powerful position. David's offer reflects the importance of valor and initiative in his administration. It also shows David's willingness to reward those who demonstrated loyalty and bravery, qualities that were essential for the leaders of Israel.<p><b>And Joab son of Zeruiah went up first,</b><br>Joab, a key figure in David's military campaigns, was David's nephew, the son of Zeruiah, David's sister. His actions here demonstrate his ambition and military prowess. Joab's willingness to take on the challenge reflects his character as a bold and decisive leader. His relationship with David was complex, marked by both loyalty and tension, as seen in various accounts throughout David's reign (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>).<p><b>and he became the chief.</b><br>Joab's success in this challenge secured his position as the chief commander of David's army. This role was crucial in the establishment and expansion of David's kingdom. Joab's leadership was instrumental in many of David's military victories, although his methods and decisions were sometimes controversial. His appointment as chief commander fulfilled David's promise and set the stage for future military campaigns that would solidify Israel's dominance in the region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his leadership and heart for God.

Perhaps the phrase here used means head and governor of Jerusalem. (Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.">1Chronicles 11:8</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The name and fresh glory of Joab, as given here, are not given in <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3-10</a>; and we could suppose that they were purposely withheld there. It is true that Joab already held high office, probably the first place as captain of David's men, but Bertheau's objection to the statements of this verse on such grounds easily yields to the considerations - first, that there can be no doubt Joab had fallen into disfavour with David <span class="accented">and others</span>, upon his slaying of Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-29, 36, 37</a>); and further, that this was a great occasion, exceedingly favourable for evoking any very special ability of younger or unknown men, at present lost under the shadow of larger growths. The advantage which Joab gained now was one that confirmed his position and increased largely his influence; and an indication that he was not slow to avail himself of it is probably to be traced in the eighth verse, where it is said while "David built... even from Millo round about,... Joab repaired the rest of the city." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
