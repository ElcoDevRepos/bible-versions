The battle took place on Mount Gilboa, a significant location in Israel's history. The intensification of the battle suggests a turning point where the Philistines gained the upper hand. Historically, this reflects the ongoing struggle between these two nations, with the Philistines often being a thorn in Israel's side. Theologically, this moment can be seen as a consequence of Saul's disobedience to God, as prophesied by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>).<p><b>the archers overtook him</b><br>The mention of archers highlights the military tactics of the Philistines, who were known for their advanced weaponry and strategic prowess. Archers played a crucial role in ancient warfare, often determining the outcome of battles. This detail underscores the vulnerability of Saul and his forces. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a fulfillment of God's judgment on Saul for his failure to fully obey God's commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>).<p><b>and wounded him</b><br>Saul's wounding by the archers signifies the beginning of the end for Israel's first king. This physical wound symbolizes the spiritual and moral decline that had already taken place in Saul's life. His injury foreshadows his imminent death, which is a direct result of his rebellion against God. This moment can be paralleled with the concept of divine retribution found throughout Scripture, where disobedience leads to downfall. Saul's demise also sets the stage for David's rise, a type of Christ, who would establish a kingdom characterized by a heart after God (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Scripture frames this moment as the turning point of the conflict: &#8220;When the battle intensified against Saul&#8221; (1 Chron 10:3).<p>&#8226; The Philistines had already broken Israel&#8217;s lines (<a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1&#8211;2</a>), fulfilling Samuel&#8217;s warning: &#8220;Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Intensification signals the LORD&#8217;s withdrawal of favor that Saul had forfeited through disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13&#8211;14</a>; 15:23; 1 Chron 10:13).<p>&#8226; Similar language appears when God judges faithless leaders&#8212;pressure rises until collapse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-12.htm">Joshua 7:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that earthly strength crumbles when hearts turn from God (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The archers overtook him</b><p>&#8226;

Arrows also symbolize divine judgment arriving swiftly (<a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-12.htm">Lamentations 3:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s former stature&#8212;head and shoulders above all Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>)&#8212;cannot shield him from arrows that &#8220;overtook&#8221; him, highlighting the futility of mere human advantage (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The enemy&#8217;s long-range assault underscores his isolation; no close-quarter support is left.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And wounded him</b><p>&#8226;

The injury fulfills the LORD&#8217;s earlier word that Saul&#8217;s reign would end in dishonor (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p>&#8226; It also sets the stage for David&#8217;s rise, for God &#8220;removes kings and raises up kings&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">1 Chronicles 10:3</a> describes the decisive moment God allowed the Philistines to overwhelm Saul. As the battle surges, distant archers locate and pierce Israel&#8217;s king, demonstrating that no position, height, or armor can rescue those who persist in rebellion. The verse underscores divine sovereignty over conflict, the certainty of God&#8217;s warnings, and the inevitability of judgment that opens the way for the next chapter in redemptive history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The battle went sore against Saul.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">was heavy upon</span> (Samuel, "unto") <span class= "ital">him,</span> like a burden weighing him to the earth.<p><span class= "bld">And the archers hit him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And they that shoot with the bow came upon him; and he shuddered</span> (Sam., "greatly") <span class= "ital">before the shooters.</span> "He shuddered or trembled" (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm" title="This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>). The verb is properly to writhe, travail (<a href="/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a>). Saul's deadly terror was natural. He believed himself forsaken of God, and stood now, after a lost battle, beset by murderous foes, whom he could not reach. There was no chance of a fair hand to hand encounter. The Heb. word for "archers" is the same in both places in Sam. (<span class= "ital">morim</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> here a rarer form (<span class= "ital">yorim,</span> <a href="/2_chronicles/35-23.htm" title="And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.">2Chronicles 35:23</a>) fills the second place. The Philistines were from Egypt, and the bow was a favourite Egyptian arm. The hieroglyph for "soldier" (<span class= "ital">menfat</span>) is a man with bow and quiver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The archers hit him</span>. The literal translation would be, <span class="accented">the shooters</span>, <span class="accented">men with the bow</span>, <span class="accented">found him.</span> The context makes it plain that the meaning is that the arrows of the pursuers rather than the pursuers themselves "found" him, and these made him argue all the rest. To this our Authorized Version has jumped by the one word "hit" him. It is evident from ver. 8 that the Philistines did not find the body of Saul to recognize it till next day. <span class="cmt_word">And he was wounded of the archers</span>. The radical meaning of the verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>) is rather "to twist" (<span class="accented">torquere</span>) or "be twisted," "writhe" (<span class="accented">torqueri</span>). And the meaning here is in harmony with it, that Saul trembled from fear or writhed with the pain already inflicted of the arrows. Hence the parallel passage couples with this same verb, the adverb <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5da;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the battle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mil&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
