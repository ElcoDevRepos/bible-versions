His role as chief indicates his leadership in the musical aspect of temple worship. Asaph is also credited with several Psalms (e.g., Psalms 50, 73-83), highlighting his influence in Israel's worship practices. His leadership reflects the importance of organized worship in Israel's spiritual life.<p><b>Zechariah was second</b><br>Zechariah's position as second suggests a hierarchical structure in the musical service, emphasizing order and organization in worship. This structure mirrors the broader organization of the Levitical duties as outlined in the Law of Moses, ensuring that worship was conducted with reverence and precision.<p><b>then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel</b><br>These names represent a group of skilled Levite musicians. The inclusion of Obed-edom is significant, as he previously housed the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>), indicating his continued association with the Ark and its worship. The diversity of names reflects the collective effort in worship, with each individual contributing to the overall harmony and beauty of the service.<p><b>They were to play the harps and lyres</b><br>Harps and lyres were stringed instruments commonly used in ancient Israelite worship. Their use in temple music underscores the importance of instrumental music in creating an atmosphere of reverence and joy. This practice is consistent with other biblical references to music in worship, such as in <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, which calls for various instruments to praise God.<p><b>while Asaph sounded the cymbals</b><br>Asaph's role in sounding the cymbals highlights the use of percussion in worship, providing rhythm and emphasis. Cymbals were often used to mark significant moments in worship, adding a dynamic element to the musical ensemble. This practice is seen in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>, where cymbals are part of the celebration as the Ark is brought to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>A prominent Levite musician and seer, appointed by King David to lead worship.
