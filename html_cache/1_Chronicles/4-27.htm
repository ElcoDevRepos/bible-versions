This reflects the cultural importance of lineage and inheritance. The number of children also indicates prosperity and divine favor, as large families were essential for agricultural and pastoral societies. Shimei's family size contrasts with the smaller families of his brothers, highlighting a unique blessing or circumstance in his life.<p><b>but his brothers did not have many children</b><br>This phrase suggests a contrast between Shimei and his brothers, indicating a disparity in family size within the same clan. In biblical times, having fewer children could be seen as a lack of divine blessing or favor. This could also imply potential challenges or hardships faced by his brothers, whether due to health, economic conditions, or divine providence. The mention of this detail underscores the importance of family and progeny in maintaining tribal and clan strength.<p><b>so their whole clan did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah</b><br>The comparison to the sons of Judah highlights the prominence and growth of the tribe of Judah, which was prophesied to be a leading tribe in Israel (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>). Judah's descendants included significant figures such as King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, fulfilling the messianic prophecy. The mention of Shimei's clan not being as numerous serves to emphasize the fulfillment of God's promises to Judah and the divine orchestration of Israel's tribal dynamics. This also reflects the historical reality of Judah's dominance and the eventual establishment of the Davidic line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A descendant of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

It reminds us that God has a unique plan for each of us, and our worth is not determined by numbers or size.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_over_numbers.htm">Faithfulness Over Numbers</a></b><br>While the tribe of Simeon was smaller, the focus should be on faithfulness to God's calling rather than numerical strength. This teaches us to value spiritual growth and obedience over worldly measures of success.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_impact.htm">Legacy and Impact</a></b><br>Shimei's relatively large family within a smaller tribe suggests that individual families can still have a significant impact.

While Shimei&#8217;s branch flourished, the rest of the brothers experienced limited growth, underscoring truths found in passages such as <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/113-9.htm">Psalm 113:9</a>, where the Lord alone grants or withholds increase.<p>&#8226; The text invites recognition that fruitfulness is never guaranteed by human effort alone; rather, as <a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a> points out, it is ultimately the Lord who blesses the fruit of the womb.<p>&#8226; This disparity also prevents any assumption that tribal destiny is automatic; each family remains accountable to walk in obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so their whole clan did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah</b><p>&#8226; The final clause ties personal realities to wider tribal outcomes. Because the majority of Simeonite families stayed small, &#8220;their whole clan did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s growth had been prophetically announced in <a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>, and census data confirm it: <a href="/numbers/1-27.htm">Numbers 1:27</a> lists Judah at 74,600, while Simeon totals only 59,300 (<a href="/numbers/1-23.htm">Numbers 1:23</a>) and later plummets to 22,200 (<a href="/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This size gap fulfills Jacob&#8217;s earlier warning that Simeon would be scattered (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). Indeed, when the land is allotted, Simeon receives towns inside Judah&#8217;s territory (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>), and by the monarchy many Simeonites have blended into Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Through these details the chronicler reinforces that God&#8217;s prophetic word stands unchanged over centuries; population trends, borders, and tribal identities all unfold exactly as spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a> records literal family numbers to spotlight God&#8217;s precise oversight. Shimei&#8217;s exceptional fruitfulness contrasts with his brothers&#8217; limited offspring, and that difference affects the tribe&#8217;s long-term size, demonstrating both divine sovereignty and the steady fulfillment of earlier prophecies concerning Simeon and Judah. God&#8217;s word proves accurate down to census figures, and His purposes advance through the ordinary realities of births, family lines, and tribal destinies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">His brethren had not many children.</span>--His brethren, i.e., his fellow-tribesmen.
