The use of chariots in ancient warfare was a significant advantage, as they provided speed and mobility on the battlefield. This large number of chariots indicates the seriousness of the threat perceived by the Ammonites. Chariots were often associated with the military might of nations like Egypt and the Hittites, and their use here underscores the scale of the conflict. The hiring of such a large force also reflects the wealth and resources available to the Ammonites.<p><b>as well as the king of Maacah with his troops</b><br>Maacah was a small Aramean kingdom located near the region of Geshur, east of the Sea of Galilee. The involvement of the king of Maacah suggests a coalition of smaller states against Israel, highlighting the regional tensions and alliances. This alliance with Maacah indicates the Ammonites' strategy to bolster their forces with additional troops, showing the political maneuvering common in the ancient Near East. The king of Maacah's participation also reflects the interconnectedness of the region's politics and the common practice of forming alliances for mutual defense.<p><b>who came and camped near Medeba</b><br>Medeba was a city located on the plateau of Moab, east of the Jordan River. Its strategic location made it a suitable staging ground for military operations. The choice of Medeba as a campsite suggests a tactical decision to position forces advantageously for the upcoming battle. This area was known for its fertile land and was often contested by neighboring powers. The mention of Medeba provides geographical context, indicating the proximity of the conflict to Israelite territory and the potential threat to Israel's security.<p><b>while the Ammonites were mustered from their cities</b><br>The mustering of the Ammonites from their cities indicates a full mobilization of their military resources. This action reflects the seriousness with which the Ammonites viewed the impending conflict with Israel. The gathering of troops from various cities suggests a coordinated effort to present a united front against David's forces. This mobilization also highlights the organizational capabilities of the Ammonite leadership and their determination to resist Israelite dominance.<p><b>and marched out for battle</b><br>The phrase signifies the readiness and determination of the Ammonite coalition to engage in warfare. This movement towards battle underscores the tension and hostility between the Ammonites and Israel. The march to battle is a common motif in biblical narratives, often symbolizing the clash between opposing forces and the unfolding of God's purposes in history. In the broader biblical context, such conflicts often serve as a backdrop for demonstrating God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

The chronicler puts the total at 32,000 + the Maachathite contingent; Samuel at 32,000 + 1,000 Maachathites. The expression "32,000 chariotry" (<span class= "ital">rekeb</span>) is not to be pressed. The writer wished to lay proper stress on the chariots and cavalry as the chief arm of the Aramaean states, and at the same time to be as concise as possible. That he was not thinking of 32,000 chariots in the literal sense is clear, (1) because he must have known that an army would not consist of chariots only; (2) in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm" title="And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.">1Chronicles 18:4</a> he had already assigned to the army of Zobah its natural proportions of chariots, cavalry, and infantry. (Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/19-18.htm" title="But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.">1Chronicles 19:18</a>, below.) The present text of Samuel can hardly be right, as it makes the whole army consist of infantry. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm" title="And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.">2Samuel 8:4</a>.) The great plains of Aram were a natural training-ground for horsemen and charioteers.<p><span class= "bld">Who came and pitched</span> (their camp) <span class= "bld">before Medeba.</span>--Another detail peculiar to the Chronicles. Medeba, the meeting-place of the Aramaean forces, lay south-east of Heshbon, on a site now known as <span class= "ital">Madibiya.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the children of Ammon gathered themselves</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The muster of the Ammonites is not mentioned in Samuel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty and two thousand chariots</span>. The reading in the parallel place is evidently what is intended (comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a> with its parallel, <a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>). Clearly a stop should follow the numeral, which designates the number of the men under arms. <span class="cmt_word">Medeba</span>. Some four miles south-cast of Heshbon (<a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), or others give it as nine miles.
