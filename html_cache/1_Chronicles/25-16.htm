The number nine in biblical numerology often signifies divine completeness or conveys the idea of finality. Mattaniah's name means "gift of Yahweh," indicating a divine purpose or calling. This reflects the importance of music and worship in Israel's religious life, as these musicians were set apart for a holy task.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers&#8212;</b><br>The inclusion of Mattaniah's sons and brothers highlights the familial aspect of the Levitical service. This suggests a hereditary role in temple service, emphasizing the continuity and tradition within the Levitical families. It also underscores the communal nature of worship, where family units participated together in the service of God. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of family and community in faith practices, as seen in other parts of Scripture where family lines are significant in maintaining religious duties.<p><b>12 in all;</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often representing God's authority and governmental foundation, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. In this context, the number twelve may symbolize completeness and the organized structure of worship established by David. It reflects the order and precision in the worship practices of ancient Israel, ensuring that worship was conducted in a manner that honored God. This structured approach to worship can be seen as a type of the order and harmony found in the body of Christ, the Church, which is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mattaniah.htm">Mattaniah</a></b><br>A leader among the musicians appointed by King David for the service of song in the house of the Lord.
