His role in the census reflects his position of authority and trust. The act of counting the men, or conducting a census, was initiated by King David, as recorded in <a href="/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>. The census was intended to assess military strength, but it was against God's will, as it demonstrated reliance on human resources rather than divine provision. Joab's reluctance to complete the task, as seen in his protest in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-3.htm">1 Chronicles 21:3</a>, indicates his awareness of the potential spiritual consequences. The incomplete census suggests divine intervention or a change of heart, highlighting Joab's complex character&#8212;loyal yet often morally conflicted.<p><b>For because of this census wrath came upon Israel,</b><br>The wrath mentioned here refers to God's anger, which resulted in a severe plague as a consequence of the census. This divine judgment underscores the seriousness of David's sin in ordering the census, which was seen as an act of pride and self-reliance. The wrath upon Israel serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience leads to blessing and disobedience to judgment. This event parallels other instances in Scripture where God's wrath is kindled by disobedience, such as the golden calf incident in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate need for atonement and points to the sacrificial system fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>and the number was not entered in the Book of the Chronicles of King David.</b><br>The omission of the census number from the official records signifies its disapproval by God and its lack of legitimacy. The "Book of the Chronicles of King David" likely refers to a historical record or annal that documented the reign and achievements of King David. The absence of the census data in this record serves as a testament to its failure and the divine disapproval of the act. This omission highlights the importance of aligning human actions with divine will and serves as a cautionary tale for future generations. It also emphasizes the theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs, a recurring motif throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab_son_of_zeruiah.htm">Joab son of Zeruiah</a></b><br>Joab was the commander of King David's army and a key military leader in Israel.

David&#8217;s own annals refuse to preserve a statistic linked to sin and judgment. Instead, the narrative directs readers to value obedience over numbers (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>) and to remember that &#8220;the LORD saves not with sword and spear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a> warns against substituting human calculation for dependence on the Lord.

However differently enough from the method of either nature or mankind, the antidote has here preceded the evil. For <span class="cmt_word">because there fell wrath for it</span>, read the Hebrew, <span class="accented">and there was for this wrath upon Israel.</span> The last sentence of the verse purports to say that such numbering as had been done before the point at which Joab stopped was not honoured by a place, where other numbers were found, in the register of the chronicles of King David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Zeruiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6870.htm">Strong's 6870: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zeruiah -- an Israelite woman</span><br /><br /><span class="word">began</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1495;&#1461;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2490.htm">Strong's 2490: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bore, to wound, to dissolve, to profane, to break, to begin, to play</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to count [the men]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(lim&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
