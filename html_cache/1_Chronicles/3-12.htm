He is known for initially doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord, though not wholeheartedly. His reign was marked by military campaigns, including a significant victory over Edom. However, his later idolatry and arrogance led to his downfall. This highlights the recurring biblical theme of the importance of faithfulness to God and the consequences of turning away from Him.<p><b>Azariah his son</b><br>Azariah, also known as Uzziah, was the son of Amaziah and became king of Judah. His reign is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>. He is noted for his long and prosperous reign, during which he strengthened Judah militarily and economically. However, his pride led to his downfall when he unlawfully entered the temple to burn incense, resulting in God striking him with leprosy. This serves as a reminder of the dangers of pride and the importance of respecting God's established order.<p><b>Jotham his son</b><br>Jotham was the son of Azariah (Uzziah) and became king of Judah. His reign is described in <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32-38</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27</a>. Jotham is portrayed as a king who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, continuing the construction projects and military successes of his father. His reign was relatively peaceful, and he is noted for his obedience to God, contrasting with the failures of his predecessors. This highlights the blessings that come with faithfulness and obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>Ahaz was a king of Judah known for his idolatrous practices and lack of faithfulness to God.

This matters because:<p>&#8226; The verse confirms the historical succession promised to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Amaziah began well: &#8220;He did right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>; see also <a href="/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1&#8211;4</a>).

The genealogy therefore whispers a warning: covenant privilege carries responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Azariah his son</b><p>&#8211; Azariah (also called Uzziah) reigned an extraordinary fifty-two years (<a href="/2_kings/15-1.htm">2 Kings 15:1&#8211;2</a>). Including him in the chain shows:<p>&#8226; God preserves the dynasty even through long, mixed reigns. Azariah &#8220;sought God&#8230; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Prosperity bred pride: &#8220;When he became strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). Leprosy isolated him, yet the throne stood firm.<p>&#8226; The name shift from Uzziah back to Azariah in Chronicles keeps the reader focused on lineage, not personal achievements.

The verse reminds us that earthly kings rise and fall, yet the royal line endures until it culminates in Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8&#8211;9</a>).
