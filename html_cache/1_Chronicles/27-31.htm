The Hagrites were known to be nomadic herdsmen, which aligns with Jaziz's role in managing flocks. This connection to Hagar and Ishmael highlights the diverse backgrounds of those serving in King David's administration, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to Hagar that her descendants would be numerous (<a href="/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10</a>).<p><b>was in charge of the flocks.</b><br>Flocks were a significant part of the economy in ancient Israel, providing wool, milk, and meat. Being in charge of the flocks was a position of responsibility and trust, indicating Jaziz's competence and reliability. This role required knowledge of animal husbandry and the ability to manage resources effectively. The mention of flocks also connects to biblical themes of shepherding, a metaphor often used for leadership, including Jesus as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>All these officials</b><br>The passage refers to a list of officials who managed various aspects of King David's property and resources. This organizational structure reflects the administrative sophistication of David's kingdom, which was necessary for maintaining order and prosperity. It also demonstrates the importance of delegation and the use of skilled individuals to manage different sectors of the kingdom.<p><b>were in charge of King David&#8217;s property.</b><br>King David's property included vast lands, livestock, and resources, which required careful management to ensure the kingdom's stability and growth. The officials' roles in overseeing these assets highlight the wealth and power of David's reign. This stewardship of resources can be seen as a type of Christ's future kingdom, where He will reign with perfect justice and order. The management of property also underscores the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with resources to manage for God's glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jaziz_the_hagrite.htm">Jaziz the Hagrite</a></b><br>Jaziz is identified as the overseer of King David's flocks.
