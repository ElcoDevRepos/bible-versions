This acknowledgment reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>, where Samuel anoints David as king. The establishment of David's kingship is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the transition from the rule of Saul to a dynasty that would lead to the Messiah. The term "established" indicates stability and divine ordination, suggesting that David's reign is not merely a result of human effort but of God's sovereign plan. This echoes the covenantal promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>, where God assures David of an enduring dynasty.<p><b>and had highly exalted his kingdom</b><br>The exaltation of David's kingdom is a testament to God's favor and blessing. This phrase underscores the idea that David's success and the expansion of his kingdom are attributed to divine intervention rather than personal ambition. The exaltation can be seen in David's military victories, territorial expansion, and the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. This exaltation prefigures the ultimate exaltation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, whose kingdom is eternal and spiritual, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament.<p><b>for the sake of His people Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights God's covenantal faithfulness to Israel. David's kingship and the prosperity of his kingdom are not solely for his benefit but for the welfare of the entire nation. This reflects the biblical theme of leadership as service, where the king is a shepherd to God's people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>. The phrase also points to God's overarching plan for Israel to be a light to the nations, as mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The welfare of Israel under David's rule foreshadows the ultimate salvation and restoration brought by Jesus Christ, who is the Good Shepherd and the King of Kings, ensuring the spiritual well-being of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the king of Israel who recognizes God's hand in establishing his reign.

Supposing that any special connection subsists between this and the previous verse, it is not necessary to consider it remote. Then, as now, the building of a house for one's self, much more the building of a noble palace on the part of a king, is an indication of feeling settled and "confirmed." It was a partial indication of the "lifted-up kingdom" that the king should have a palace of unwonted magnificence. This must have weighed all the more in the case of a nation which, not for its sacred things, nor for its king, nor for its people, had ever had as yet any adequate and worthy housing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">realized</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
