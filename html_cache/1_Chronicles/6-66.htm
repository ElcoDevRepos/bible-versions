They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, and the lampstand. This role highlights their importance in the religious life of Israel. The Kohathites' duties are detailed in <a href="/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4</a>, where their responsibilities are outlined. Their service underscores the holiness and reverence required in handling sacred items, pointing to the need for purity and dedication in worship.<p><b>were given cities</b><br>The allocation of cities to the Levites, including the Kohathites, is a fulfillment of God's command in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>. The Levites were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were instead distributed among the tribes of Israel to serve as priests and teachers of the Law. This distribution ensured that the spiritual needs of the Israelites were met throughout the land. The cities provided to the Levites also included pasturelands for their livestock, indicating God's provision for their physical needs as they fulfilled their spiritual duties.<p><b>from the tribe of Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes descended from Joseph, one of the sons of Jacob. The tribe of Ephraim held a significant position in Israel, often representing the northern kingdom in later biblical history. The allocation of cities within Ephraim's territory to the Kohathites reflects the integration of the Levites into the broader community of Israel, ensuring that the priestly influence was present in all regions. Ephraim's prominence is seen in prophecies and blessings, such as those in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Jacob blesses Ephraim over his older brother Manasseh, indicating the tribe's future importance.<p><b>for their territory</b><br>The concept of territory for the Levites is unique, as they did not possess land in the same way as the other tribes. Instead, their "territory" consisted of cities scattered throughout the land of Israel. This arrangement emphasized their role as spiritual leaders and servants to all the tribes, rather than being tied to a specific geographic location. The Levites' presence in various territories served as a constant reminder of the centrality of worship and adherence to God's laws in the life of the nation. This distribution also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being "a royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), called to serve and minister in diverse contexts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_kohath.htm">Sons of Kohath</a></b><br>Kohath was one of the sons of Levi, and his descendants were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
