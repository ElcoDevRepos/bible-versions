It was originally a Moabite city before being conquered by the Amorite king Sihon, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25-26</a>. The Israelites, under Moses, defeated Sihon and took possession of Heshbon (<a href="/numbers/21-34.htm">Numbers 21:34-35</a>). This city later became a Levitical city, designated for the Levites who were responsible for religious duties and teaching the law. Heshbon's strategic location made it a significant city in biblical times, often mentioned in the context of Israel's battles and territorial expansions.<p><b>and Jazer</b><br>Jazer was another city east of the Jordan, also within the territory given to the tribe of Gad. It was known for its fertile land and was a center for agriculture and livestock. The city was captured by the Israelites during their conquest of the Transjordan region (<a href="/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>). Jazer is frequently mentioned in the context of the allotment of land to the tribes of Israel and the establishment of Levitical cities. The city&#8217;s agricultural prosperity is highlighted in <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8-9</a>, where its vineyards are noted, indicating its economic importance.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The mention of pasturelands indicates the provision for the Levites, who were given cities and surrounding lands to support their livelihood, as they did not receive a tribal inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>). These pasturelands were essential for grazing livestock, which was a primary source of sustenance and economic activity. The allocation of pasturelands reflects the practical needs of the Levites, ensuring they could maintain their flocks and herds while fulfilling their religious duties. This provision underscores the importance of supporting those dedicated to spiritual service, a principle echoed in the New Testament regarding the support of church leaders (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant city in the territory of Reuben, originally a Moabite city.

Heshbon was once the seat of King Sihon of the Amorites, conquered by Israel on the journey to Canaan (<a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; After the conquest, it lay in the eastern territory eventually assigned to Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-17</a>), yet <a href="/joshua/21-39.htm">Joshua 21:39</a> records it as one of the Levitical cities for the family of Merari.<p>&#8226; By naming Heshbon here, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a> reminds us that God provided dwelling places for the Levites in strategic, well-known towns&#8212;a fulfillment of <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>, where the Lord promised to care for the tribe that served at the tabernacle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and</b><p>&#8226; The simple conjunction ties two specific sites into a single allotment.<p>&#8226; It underscores that God&#8217;s provision for His servants was not piecemeal; both locations came under the same divine directive (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The link also hints at proximity: Heshbon and Jazer sit only a few miles apart east of the Jordan, forming a cohesive ministry region for Levites who taught God&#8217;s Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jazer</b><p>&#8226; First mentioned when the tribes of Reuben and Gad requested the Transjordan lands for their livestock (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-3</a>), Jazer became a fortified town (<a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Heshbon, it was later set apart for Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-39.htm">Joshua 21:39</a>). Its inclusion shows that spiritual ministry was woven into everyday community life on Israel&#8217;s frontier.<p>&#8226; The chronicle&#8217;s record confirms that God kept His word decades after the initial conquest, safeguarding a place for worship and instruction among His people (<a href="/joshua/21-41.htm">Joshua 21:41-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>together with their pasturelands</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Pasturelands&#8221; refers to the surrounding fields designated for Levite herds (<a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-3</a>). Because the Levites held no tribal inheritance, these open spaces were vital for sustenance.<p>&#8226; The phrase stresses completeness: not only towns but also the surrounding resources were granted (<a href="/leviticus/25-32.htm">Leviticus 25:32-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Such detail reflects the Lord&#8217;s holistic care&#8212;He provides what His servants need to live and serve (<a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a> records that Heshbon and Jazer, along with all the land needed to support livestock, were handed to the Levites. This brief line testifies that God faithfully honored His covenant promises, embedding centers of worship and instruction even in the eastern territories. The verse affirms His meticulous provision for those who serve Him and highlights how every part of the land, great or small, ultimately belongs to the Lord and is used for His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Heshbon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#353;&#183;b&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2809.htm">Strong's 2809: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heshbon -- a place East of the Jordan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Jazer,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1494;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#8216;&#183;z&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3270.htm">Strong's 3270: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jazer -- a place East of the Jordan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">together with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their pasturelands.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 6:81 And Heshbon with its suburbs and Jazer (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/6-80.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 6:80"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 6:80" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/7-1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 7:1"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 7:1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
