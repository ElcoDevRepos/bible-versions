This practice reflects the importance of starting the day with worship and devotion, setting a tone of reverence and gratitude. The act of standing is symbolic of respect and attentiveness, similar to how one might stand in the presence of a king. This morning ritual can be connected to <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, where David speaks of directing his prayer to God in the morning.<p><b>to give thanks and praise to the LORD</b><br>Giving thanks and praise was central to the Levitical duties, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and goodness. This practice is rooted in the understanding that God is the source of all blessings and deserves continual gratitude. The Levites' role in leading worship highlights the communal aspect of thanksgiving, as they represented the people before God. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of worship, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>, which calls believers to enter God's gates with thanksgiving.<p><b>and likewise in the evening</b><br>The inclusion of evening worship underscores the idea of continual devotion, framing the day with praise. This practice reflects the Jewish understanding of a day, which begins at sunset, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>. Evening worship serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness throughout the day and a preparation for the next. It also connects to the concept of offering a "sacrifice of praise" (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), symbolizing a life dedicated to God. The dual times of worship, morning and evening, can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end (<a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service in the temple.
