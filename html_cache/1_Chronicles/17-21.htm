In the ancient Near Eastern context, nations often had their own deities, but Israel was distinct in being chosen by the one true God. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a holy people chosen by God. The rhetorical question emphasizes Israel's special relationship with God, setting them apart from other nations.<p><b>the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself?</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, where God delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt, as recounted in the book of Exodus. The concept of redemption is central to Israel's identity, symbolizing God's intervention and covenant relationship. This act of redemption prefigures the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, as seen in the New Testament, where believers are redeemed from sin.<p><b>You made a name for Yourself through great and awesome wonders</b><br>The "great and awesome wonders" refer to the miraculous events during the Exodus, such as the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision in the wilderness. These acts demonstrated God's power and established His reputation among the nations. This theme is echoed in <a href="/psalms/106-8.htm">Psalm 106:8</a>, where God's deeds are said to make His mighty power known.<p><b>by driving out nations from before Your people,</b><br>This phrase refers to the conquest of Canaan, where God enabled Israel to defeat and displace the existing inhabitants. This was part of fulfilling the promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The driving out of nations also serves as a type of spiritual victory over sin and evil, pointing to the ultimate triumph in Christ.<p><b>whom You redeemed from Egypt.</b><br>The redemption from Egypt is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation and the establishment of a covenant relationship with God. This act of redemption is celebrated annually in the Passover, which also foreshadows Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection, as He is referred to as the Passover Lamb in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, set apart to be a holy nation and a light to the Gentiles.

Each phrase piles up evidence of His covenant faithfulness and power. The verse invites us to praise the Lord for keeping His promises, to recognize Israel&#8217;s enduring role in His plan, and to trust the same Redeemer who, in Christ, continues to make a name for Himself among all nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And what one nation in the earth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And who is like Thy people Israel, a single</span> (isolated) <span class= "ital">race on the earth?</span> (Comp. <a href="/numbers/23-9.htm" title="For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: see, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.">Numbers 23:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Nation</span> (<span class= "ital">goy</span>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> race; a people considered as united by common blood, speech, country.<p><span class= "bld">People</span> ('<span class= "ital">?m</span>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a political community, social union, or state, owning one sovereign.<p><span class= "bld">Whom God went</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">which God went</span> (marched) <span class= "ital">to redeem to Himself as a people.</span> Samuel has "which gods went."<p><span class= "bld">To make thee a name.</span>--That is, for Thyself, God.

The text of this verse in Samuel is corrupt (comp. the LXX.), and perhaps the added phrase is spurious. But, on the other hand, the chronicler may have omitted it because, like Isaiah, he regarded the heathen deities as non-entities. In earlier times, foreign gods were spoken of as real beings, subordinate to Jehovah. (Comp. the LXX. rendering of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - In the parallel verse (<a href="/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a>), our Authorized Version, following the Hebrew text (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>), reads, "To do <span class="accented">for you</span> great things and terrible." The transition is awkward, no way in harmony with the other short clauses of the passage, and it would be inexplicable except for the alternative open to us, of regarding it as a quotation from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, brought in regardless of the context into which it was introduced. The difficulty does not meet us in our present passage, being obviated by the other sentences of our compiler. Both places, however, manifestly quote from the Book of Deuteronomy, with the grand passages and grand verbiage of which we may well imagine David familiar. A similar familiarity is also betokened in the following verses, as regard other Pentateuchal passages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
