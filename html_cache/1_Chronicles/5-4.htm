In this context, Joel is a patriarchal figure within the tribe of Reuben. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the historical and tribal lineage of Israel, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant with His people. The tribe of Reuben, as the firstborn of Jacob, had a significant role, although they lost their birthright due to Reuben's transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>).<p><b>Shemaiah his son:</b><br>Shemaiah is a name that means "heard by Yahweh." This name reflects the cultural importance of names in ancient Israel, often signifying a person's character or God's relationship with them. Shemaiah's inclusion in the genealogy underscores the importance of maintaining a record of lineage, which was crucial for tribal identity and inheritance rights. The name also appears elsewhere in the Bible, often associated with prophetic figures, indicating a possible tradition of spiritual leadership.<p><b>Gog his son:</b><br>Gog is a name that appears in prophetic literature, notably in <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a>, where Gog is a leader of a great army from the north. While the Gog mentioned here is not the same as the one in Ezekiel, the name may have been common in the region. The mention of Gog in this genealogy highlights the interconnectedness of biblical narratives and the recurring themes of conflict and divine intervention. It also serves as a reminder of the eschatological battles that are a part of biblical prophecy.<p><b>Shimei his son:</b><br>Shimei is another name that appears frequently in the Old Testament, often associated with individuals who played significant roles in Israel's history. The name means "God hears," which again reflects the cultural significance of names. Shimei's inclusion in the genealogy of Reuben emphasizes the importance of maintaining a detailed record of family lines, which was essential for the preservation of tribal heritage and identity. The repetition of names like Shimei throughout the Bible also illustrates the continuity of God's people and His ongoing relationship with them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A descendant of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel.

The verse invites believers to trust the Lord&#8217;s meticulous care over their own families and to pass on a heritage of faith just as diligently.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4-6) <span class= "bld">The sons of Joel.</span>--The connection of this leading house with one of the four sons just mentioned, is implied but not stated. The line of Joel is traced through seven generations to Beerah, who was transported to Assyria by Tiglath Pileser. II., 734 B.C., in the reign of Pekah, king of Israel. Supposing there are no gaps in the series, Joel flourished 280 years (7 x 40) before that date; that is, about 1014 B.C., under David and Solomon.<p>(4) The LXX. read: "Sons of Joel Shemaiah, and Banaia (Benaiah) his son; and sons of Gog, son of Shemaiah, his son Micah," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - From which of the four sons of Reuben the line came in which Joel would appear, we do not know. Juntas and Tremellius say Hanoch, others Carmi, while the Syriac Version has Carrot <span class="accented">vice</span> Joel. It is to be remarked that in <a href="/numbers/26-8.htm">Numbers 26:8-10</a> a line of descent through <span class="accented">Pallu</span> is given, but reaching only to the second generation, <span class="cmt_word">Beerah</span> in the present list will be only ninth at furthest from Reuben, so that it is evident that it is a very fragmentary genealogy, whether the hiatus be only one, viz. between Reuben's son (whichever it may be in question) and Joel, or whether both there and elsewhere also. Of none of the eight persons beginning with Joel and ending with Beerah is anything else known, unless either <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> or <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span> may be identical with the Shema of ver. 8, in which case it might be also that the Joel of ver. 8 is identical with that of ver. 4.

These slight differences in the position of the radicals, with the introduction or omission of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, make as many as four different readings in the Hebrew. Tiglath-pileser, the second Assyrian king who came into conflict with the Israelites, reigned <span class="accented">about</span> <span class="date">B.C. 747-727</span>. Gesenius thinks that the former half of the word is the same as <span class="accented">Diglath</span>, i.q. Tigris; and that the latter, a root occurring also in the name <span class="accented">Nabo-pola-saris</span>, is from an Assyrian verb meaning "to guard." He translates the word as "Lord of the Tigris." The Assyrian reproduction of the name is <span class="accented">Tigulti-pal-tsira</span> (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), or <span class="accented">Tukulti-pal-zara</span> ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The Captivity is spoken of further in the last verse of this chapter and in <a href="/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-31</a>.
