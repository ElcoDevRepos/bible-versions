In this context, Shallum is part of the genealogical record of the tribe of Judah, which is significant as it traces the lineage of the Israelites. The name Shallum means "retribution" or "recompense," which may reflect the cultural importance of names in ancient Israel, often signifying character or destiny. This genealogical record serves to establish the continuity of God's covenant with His people, emphasizing the importance of family lineage in fulfilling divine promises.<p><b>Jekamiah was the father of Elishama</b><br>Jekamiah, whose name means "the Lord raises," continues the genealogical line. This name reflects a common theme in Hebrew culture, where names often express a relationship with God or a divine attribute. The mention of Jekamiah in this lineage underscores the importance of each generation in the unfolding of God's plan for Israel. Elishama, meaning "God has heard," is a name that appears several times in the Bible, often associated with individuals of significance. This lineage is part of the broader narrative that leads to the Davidic line, which is crucial for understanding the messianic prophecies fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The genealogies in Chronicles serve not only as historical records but also as theological affirmations of God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Shimei is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Judah.

Shallum stands near the end of that line, reminding us that God notices every individual&#8212;no matter how briefly named&#8212;in His unfolding plan (cf. <a href="/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Each link in the genealogy underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant with Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-68.htm">Psalm 78:68-70</a>). Shallum&#8217;s place shows that the promise did not skip generations; God preserved the family tree step by step.<p>&#8226; The detail also foreshadows later moments when another &#8220;Shallum&#8221; or &#8220;Shallum-like&#8221; figure would surface in Judah&#8217;s story (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>), signaling that God keeps track of names&#8212;and of hearts&#8212;over centuries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jekamiah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and Jekamiah was the father of Elishama.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-41.htm">1 Chronicles 2:41</a>)<p>&#8226; Jekamiah receives a single sentence in Scripture, yet his presence is vital. If he were missing, the chain from Judah to Elishama would break. God values obedience that may never be celebrated publicly (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording him, the chronicler upholds the reliability of the family record&#8212;crucial for land rights, temple service, and ultimately the Messianic line (<a href="/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59-63</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jekamiah&#8217;s quiet faithfulness illustrates how ordinary believers keep God&#8217;s purposes moving forward, even when history books give them only a verse (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elishama</b><p>Jekamiah&#8217;s son is the last person named in this particular branch.<p>&#8226; Elishama&#8217;s appearance ties the Jerahmeelite line back into the larger story of Judah and David, since another Elishama was a prince in David&#8217;s household (<a href="/2_samuel/5-16.htm">2 Samuel 5:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>). The repetition of the name highlights continuity across generations.<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s era needed assurance that God still had a future for His people after exile; every recorded descendant was proof (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Elishama stands as a living testimony that God completes what He starts (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>), bringing genealogical lines&#8212;and redemptive promises&#8212;to their intended goal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-41.htm">1 Chronicles 2:41</a> may look like a simple family note, yet it testifies that God tracks every generation, safeguards His covenant with Judah, and moves His salvation plan forward through everyday believers. Shallum, Jekamiah, and Elishama each remind us that our seemingly small place in God&#8217;s story is still essential, because the Author never loses track of His characters or His promises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/2-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Shallum</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;l&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
