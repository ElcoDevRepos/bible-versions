This lineage is crucial as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. The mention of Perez highlights the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Judah in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where the scepter is promised to remain with Judah. Perez's descendants were known for their leadership and strength, as seen in the roles they played in Israel's history.<p><b>and chief of all the army commanders</b><br>The role of a chief among the army commanders indicates a position of high authority and responsibility. In the context of ancient Israel, military leadership was not only about warfare but also about maintaining order and security within the nation. This position required wisdom, courage, and the ability to lead men effectively. The structure of the army, with its divisions and commanders, reflects the organized nature of David's reign and the importance of military readiness in maintaining the kingdom's stability.<p><b>for the first month</b><br>The reference to the "first month" suggests a rotational system for military service, where different commanders and their divisions served at different times. This system ensured that the army was always prepared without overburdening any single group. The first month, Nisan, was significant in the Jewish calendar as it marked the beginning of the religious year and included the celebration of Passover. This timing may symbolize new beginnings and the importance of being prepared for both spiritual and physical challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/perez.htm">Perez</a></b><br>Perez was the son of Judah and Tamar, and his lineage is significant in the genealogy of Jesus Christ.

Judah&#8217;s tribe leads not just in worship (1 Chron 4:1; 5:2) but also in national defense.<p>&#8226; The same Perez line is later traced to Boaz, David, and ultimately to Jesus (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>), underscoring how God keeps His word through the generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Chief of all the army commanders</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and chief of all the army commanders&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jashobeam (also called Josheb-Basshebeth) heads the first of twelve divisions, each 24,000 strong (1 Chron 27:1&#8211;2).<p>&#8226; His credentials are impressive: he once &#8220;raised his spear against three hundred men&#8221; (1 Chron 11:11) and is listed first among David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents military leadership as a stewardship under God (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1&#8211;4</a>).

Placing Judah&#8217;s champion in charge at that season reminds the nation that its strength rests on God&#8217;s saving acts.<p>&#8226; The rotating system (1 Chron 27:1) offered continuous protection without exhausting the people&#8212;an early illustration of shared service in the body (<a href="/numbers/4-22.htm">Numbers 4:22&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Starting the year with disciplined readiness signals the priority of preparedness in the believer&#8217;s life (<a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-3.htm">1 Chronicles 27:3</a> notes that Jashobeam, a distinguished warrior from the Perez line of Judah, was appointed chief over the army for the opening month of Israel&#8217;s annual military rotation. The verse ties leadership to covenant lineage, highlights proven character in service, and places strategic preparedness at the very start of the year&#8212;all underscoring that God&#8217;s redeemed people are to be organized, faithful, and ready under His sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Of the children of Perez.</span>--The reference is to Jashobeam. He belonged to the branch of Judah called Perez, or Pharez, to which David himself belonged.<p><span class= "bld">The chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.</span>--This notice about Jashobeam is obscure. The "captains of the host" (Heb., <span class= "ital">hosts</span>) seem to be the twelve generals of division.

Jashobeam, as the first of David's heroes, may have enjoyed a kind of precedence among the commanders of the army corps; although he was not commander-in-chief of the entire national forces, which was the function of Joab. Or perhaps it is meant merely to emphasise the fact that Jashobeam was "the first" in the rotation of the generals; so that the phrase "for the first month" explains what precedes it. Or "the captains of the hosts" may possibly mean the officers of the subdivisions of the first army corps, of whom Jashobeam was, of course, the chief.
