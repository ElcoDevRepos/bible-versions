Ahaz's reign was marked by political instability and spiritual decline, as he sought alliances with Assyria rather than relying on God. He introduced pagan worship practices, including the worship of Baal, and even sacrificed his own son, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). His actions led to significant consequences for Judah, including military defeats and economic hardship. Ahaz's reign serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of turning away from God and relying on human alliances.<p><b>Hezekiah his son</b><br>Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, was a reformer king who sought to restore the worship of Yahweh in Judah. His reign is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>. Hezekiah is noted for his faithfulness to God, his efforts to remove idolatry, and his restoration of the temple worship. He is also known for his trust in God during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem, where God miraculously delivered the city (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-36</a>). Hezekiah's reforms included the destruction of high places, the removal of idols, and the reinstitution of the Passover. His reign is often seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance and restoration that comes through Jesus Christ, who is the true King and High Priest.<p><b>Manasseh his son</b><br>Manasseh was one of the longest-reigning kings of Judah, but his reign is often remembered for its extreme idolatry and wickedness, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a>. He reversed the reforms of his father Hezekiah and led Judah into deep apostasy, including the worship of foreign gods, the desecration of the temple, and the practice of child sacrifice. Despite his initial rebellion, Manasseh's story is also one of repentance and redemption. According to <a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>, after being taken captive by the Assyrians, Manasseh humbled himself and sought the Lord, who restored him to his kingdom. This transformation highlights the themes of repentance and God's mercy, which are central to the biblical narrative and find their ultimate expression in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>Ahaz was a king of Judah known for his idolatry and lack of faith in God.
