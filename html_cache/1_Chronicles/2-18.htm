This Caleb is a descendant of Hezron, a grandson of Judah, placing him within the tribe of Judah. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles emphasize the importance of lineage and heritage, particularly in the context of the Davidic line, which is central to the Chronicler's purpose. Hezron's lineage is significant as it connects to the promises made to Abraham and the establishment of Israel.<p><b>had children by his wife Azubah and by Jerioth.</b><br>Azubah and Jerioth are mentioned as Caleb's wives, though little else is known about them. The mention of multiple wives reflects the cultural practices of the time, where polygamy was common among the Israelites, especially for those of significant status or wealth. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, with figures like Jacob, David, and Solomon. The genealogical records often highlight the importance of family and progeny in fulfilling God's promises to His people.<p><b>These were the sons of Azubah: Jesher, Shobab, and Ardon.</b><br>The sons of Azubah&#8212;Jesher, Shobab, and Ardon&#8212;are listed, though they are not prominent figures elsewhere in the biblical narrative. The inclusion of their names serves to preserve the family lineage and maintain the historical record of the tribe of Judah. This genealogical detail underscores the Chronicler's focus on continuity and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises through specific family lines. The preservation of these names also reflects the importance of each individual in the unfolding story of God's people, even if their roles are not elaborated upon in the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb.htm">Caleb</a></b><br>A descendant of Hezron, Caleb is a significant figure in the genealogies of Judah.

The <span class= "ital">prima facie</span> rendering is, "And Caleb son of Hezron begat Azubah a woman, and Jerioth: and these (are) her sons; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon." But <a href="/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1Chronicles 2:19</a> continues: "And Azubah died, and Caleb took to himself (as wife) Ephrath," which of course suggests that Azubah was not daughter but a former wife of Caleb. <a href="/1_chronicles/2-18.htm" title="And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth: her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon.">1Chronicles 2:18</a> has also been translated, "And Caleb son of Hezron caused Azubah a wife and Jerioth to bear children." (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/66-9.htm" title="Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? said the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? said your God.">Isaiah 66:9</a>.)

The LXX. has, "And Caleb took Azubah a wife and Jerioth," which only shows that the corruption of the text is ancient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - (C) Chelubai. The descendants of <span class="cmt_word">Caleb</span> (Chelubai), placed third of Hezron's sons, are next dealt with; but the subject is almost immediately interrupted by resumed reference to <span class="cmt_word">Hezron</span> (vers. 21-24), and by the table of Jemh-meel and his descendants (vers. 25-41); after which the table of Caleb, apparently the same Caleb, is carried on (vers. 42-49). Taking these broken portions, however, just as they come, we are immediately met by a series of uncertainties and surprises. Ver. 18 is obscure in that it says Caleb had children by <span class="cmt_word">Azubah</span> (the Hebrew construction also unusual), a <span class="cmt_word">wife</span>, or indeed strictly a <span class="accented">woman</span> (not even using the ordinary formula "his wife"), and by <span class="cmt_word">Jerioth</span>, of whom nothing is said; and the verse adds obscurity by saying, her sons are these, without plainly indicating to which woman reference is made. It may be safely presumed, however, from what follows, that Azubah is intended, though no other part of Scripture helps us By so much as a mention of the sons' names to determine it certainly. Meantime one Hebrew manuscript and the Chaldee Paraphrase are found to omit the words "and by Jerioth." The Vulgate, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, make Jerioth one of the <span class="accented">children -</span> possibly a daughter - of Caleb and Azubah, and this view is supported by Kennicott and Houbigant (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). The tone of ver. 19 may certainly he held to offer some countenance to the assumption that either Jerioth's name ought to appear as that of a child or not at all. The name <span class="cmt_word">Ephrath</span> in this verse abounds with interest. The ancient name of the town of Bethlehem, and also apparently of a district round it, is the same word which is found here as the name of a woman. In either case it is more generally written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as even in the two other appearances of it in this very chapter. Two manuscripts, followed by two ancient editions, and apparently by the Vulgate, substitute <span class="accented">aleph</span> for the above final <span class="accented">he.</span> In <a href="/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, Bethlehem is found united with Ephratah in one compound word. The mother Ephrath is here interesting for her descendants given, her son <span class="cmt_word">Hur</span>, grandson <span class="cmt_word">Uri</span>, and great-grandson <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>. Further reference to these is made in ver. 50. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Caleb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
