The fields and villages provided agricultural resources and living spaces for the inhabitants. In the context of the Levitical cities, these lands were essential for the sustenance of the Levites, who did not receive a tribal inheritance like the other tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). The mention of fields and villages highlights the importance of land distribution in maintaining the economic and social structure of Israelite society.<p><b>were given to Caleb</b><br>Caleb, son of Jephunneh, is a significant figure in the Old Testament. He was one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-6.htm">Numbers 13:6</a>). Along with Joshua, Caleb showed faith in God's promise and encouraged the Israelites to take possession of the land despite the presence of formidable inhabitants (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30, 14</a>:6-9). As a reward for his faithfulness, Caleb was granted a portion of the land, specifically Hebron, as his inheritance (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-14</a>). This allocation underscores the biblical principle of rewarding faith and obedience to God.<p><b>son of Jephunneh</b><br>Jephunneh is identified as a Kenizzite, which suggests that Caleb's family may have been of non-Israelite origin, possibly assimilated into the tribe of Judah (<a href="/numbers/32-12.htm">Numbers 32:12</a>). This inclusion of Caleb's lineage highlights the theme of God's grace extending beyond ethnic boundaries, foreshadowing the New Testament message of salvation available to all people through Jesus Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). Caleb's story serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and loyalty to God, regardless of one's background.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb_son_of_jephunneh.htm">Caleb son of Jephunneh</a></b><br>Caleb was one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan.

The coordinating conjunction signals a contrast with the previous statement in verse 55, where &#8220;Hebron was given to the sons of Aaron.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses a brief &#8220;but&#8221; to highlight God-ordained distinctions (e.g., &#8220;But as for you&#8230;&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Here the contrast preserves both the Levitical inheritance of the city and Judah&#8217;s inheritance through Caleb, keeping the divine allotments intact (<a href="/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the fields and villages</b><p>&#8226;
