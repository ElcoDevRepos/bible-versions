This behavior is reminiscent of Goliath's taunts in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>, which also led to a confrontation. Taunting often precedes divine intervention or a significant victory for Israel, highlighting the theme of God defending His chosen people. The taunt can be seen as a challenge not just to Israel, but to the God of Israel, setting the stage for a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness.<p><b>Jonathan the son of David&#8217;s brother Shimei</b><br>Jonathan, mentioned here, is a lesser-known figure in the biblical narrative. He is identified as the son of Shimei, David's brother, making him David's nephew. This connection to David's family is significant, as it underscores the ongoing role of David's lineage in securing Israel's victories and maintaining God's covenant promises. The mention of Jonathan highlights the importance of family and lineage in the biblical narrative, where God often works through familial lines to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>killed him</b><br>The act of killing the taunter signifies a decisive victory for Israel and serves as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and deliver His people from their enemies. This victory can be seen as a type of Christ, who ultimately defeats the greatest enemy, sin and death, through His sacrifice and resurrection. The defeat of the taunter by Jonathan also echoes the earlier victory of David over Goliath, reinforcing the theme of God empowering the seemingly weak or unlikely individuals to achieve His purposes. This victory serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the assurance of His protection over His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of Shimea, who was David's brother.

The &#8220;he&#8221; is the unnamed Philistine giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot (<a href="/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His taunting was more than trash talk; it was open defiance of God&#8217;s covenant people, echoing Goliath&#8217;s earlier challenge: &#8220;I defy the ranks of Israel this day&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, contempt toward Israel is ultimately contempt toward Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/psalms/74-18.htm">Psalm 74:18</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God hears every insult aimed at His people and will vindicate His name (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jonathan</b><p>&#8226;

God raises new champions for each crisis; just as David once stepped up against Goliath, Jonathan now steps up against another giant (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal courage flows from confidence in the LORD, not from human reputation (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of David&#8217;s brother Shimei</b><p>&#8226;

the family legacy of trusting God in battle continued (<a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail links the victory to the house of Jesse, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise to establish David&#8217;s line as defenders of His people (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>killed him</b><p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s decisive blow ends the giant&#8217;s threat immediately, mirroring David&#8217;s earlier triumph over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>).<p>&#8226; The defeat underscores that God, not human size or weaponry, determines the outcome of every conflict (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; With each fallen giant, the Philistine grip on Israel weakens, showcasing the LORD&#8217;s continuing faithfulness to His covenant (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-22.htm">2 Samuel 21:22</a>).<p>&#8226;
