This tribe was unique in that it was divided, with half settling on the east side of the Jordan River and the other half on the west. The mention of the "half-tribe" here refers to those on the western side. This division is significant as it highlights the unity among the tribes despite geographical separation. The involvement of Manasseh in supporting David signifies a broader acceptance of his kingship across Israel, transcending regional divisions.<p><b>18,000 designated by name:</b><br>The specific number of 18,000 men indicates a substantial commitment from the half-tribe of Manasseh. Being "designated by name" suggests a formal and deliberate selection process, emphasizing the organized and intentional support for David. This reflects the seriousness with which the tribes approached the establishment of David's rule, ensuring that those who came were committed and recognized leaders or warriors.<p><b>To come and make David king:</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of their gathering: to establish David as king. David's rise to kingship was a fulfillment of God's promise and anointing through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). The support from various tribes, including Manasseh, was crucial in consolidating his rule over all Israel. This act of making David king is a pivotal moment in biblical history, as David's reign is often seen as a type of Christ's eternal kingship, with David's kingdom foreshadowing the coming of the Messiah, who would establish an everlasting kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>This refers to one of the tribes of Israel, specifically the half that settled on the west side of the Jordan River.

This shows that physical separation did not fracture spiritual loyalty to God&#8217;s chosen king.<p>- Within Chronicles the chronicler often highlights northern tribes joining David (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23, 37</a>), underscoring the eventual unity of Israel under the Davidic covenant.<p>- Cross-tribal support anticipates later revivals when people &#8220;from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>18,000 designated by name</b><p>- The exact head-count signals more than rough estimates; every soldier is known and valued. &#8220;Take a census of the whole congregation by their clans and families, listing every man by name&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>).<p>- Such precision speaks to orderly preparation rather than a hasty revolt. <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a> repeatedly offers totals (vv. 24-38), illustrating disciplined ranks ready to transfer the kingdom peacefully.<p>- 18,000 is substantial for one family group, showing wholehearted endorsement rather than token representation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To come</b><p>- The phrase highlights decisive movement toward Hebron, David&#8217;s base at the time (<a href="/2_samuel/2-3.htm">2 Samuel 2:3</a>).<p>- They leave secure homelands, cross the Jordan, and identify publicly with David&#8212;an act of faith paralleling &#8220;Your people shall volunteer freely in the day of Your power&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>).<p>- Their arrival fulfills the Lord&#8217;s timing; earlier, many in the north stayed neutral (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2-4</a>).

Their precise enrollment shows order, their journey shows faith, and their purpose shows submission to God&#8217;s revealed will.
