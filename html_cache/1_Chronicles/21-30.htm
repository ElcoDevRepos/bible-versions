This reflects the gravity of his sin in ordering the census, which was against God's will. The altar, located at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, was a place where David intended to offer sacrifices to atone for his actions. The inability to inquire of God here highlights the separation sin creates between humanity and God, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. This separation is reminiscent of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden and Israel's frequent estrangement from God due to disobedience. The need for a mediator, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, is underscored by David's predicament.<p><b>because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD</b><br>The fear of the sword of the angel of the LORD emphasizes the seriousness of divine judgment. The angel, who had been sent to execute judgment on Israel due to David's sin, represents God's holiness and justice. This fear is not merely a human reaction but a recognition of God's righteous anger. The angel's sword is a symbol of divine retribution, similar to the flaming sword guarding Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the sword of judgment in Revelation. David's fear also points to the need for repentance and the mercy of God, which is later shown when God commands the angel to cease the destruction. This incident foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who bears the sword of judgment on behalf of humanity, reconciling us to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is central to this account.
