In biblical genealogies, being "noted by name" often implies a role in fulfilling God's purposes or a connection to the covenant community.<p><b>came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah</b><br>Hezekiah reigned from approximately 715 to 686 BC and was known for his religious reforms and efforts to centralize worship in Jerusalem. His reign was marked by a return to the worship of Yahweh and the removal of idolatrous practices. This timeframe situates the events within a period of spiritual renewal and political activity in Judah.<p><b>They attacked the Hamites in their dwellings</b><br>The Hamites likely refer to descendants of Ham, one of Noah's sons, and could represent a group living in the region. This attack may reflect the ongoing territorial conflicts and the Israelites' efforts to secure their land, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The phrase suggests a divinely sanctioned military action, common in the narratives of Israel's conquest and settlement.<p><b>as well as the Meunites who were there</b><br>The Meunites are mentioned elsewhere in the Bible as a group living in the region of Edom or the southern part of Judah. They were often in conflict with Israel and Judah. This attack aligns with the biblical theme of God's people overcoming their enemies to establish peace and security in the land.<p><b>devoting them to destruction even to this day</b><br>This phrase reflects the concept of "herem," a term used for the complete destruction of a people or city as an offering to God. It signifies the total consecration of the spoils of war to God, often seen in the conquest narratives of the Old Testament. This action underscores the seriousness of maintaining purity and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>Then they settled in their place</b><br>The settlement of the Israelites in the conquered territories fulfills the promise of land given to Abraham and his descendants. It represents the establishment of God's people in the Promised Land, a recurring theme in the biblical narrative.<p><b>because there was pasture for their flocks</b><br>The availability of pasture indicates the suitability of the land for sustaining the Israelites' agrarian lifestyle. This detail highlights God's provision for His people, ensuring they have the resources needed for survival and prosperity. It also reflects the pastoral culture of ancient Israel, where livestock was a primary source of wealth and sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah,_king_of_judah.htm">Hezekiah, King of Judah</a></b><br>Hezekiah was a king known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in Judah.
