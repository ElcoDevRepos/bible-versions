His lineage traces back to Aaron, making him a legitimate priest according to the Levitical line. David's decision to leave Zadok in charge signifies trust and recognition of his priestly authority. This act also foreshadows Zadok's future role as a high priest during Solomon's reign, highlighting the continuity of priestly service in Israel.<p><b>and his fellow priests</b><br>The mention of "fellow priests" indicates a collective responsibility in maintaining the worship and sacrifices at the tabernacle. This group of priests would have been responsible for the daily rituals and offerings, ensuring that the worship of Yahweh continued uninterrupted. This communal aspect of priesthood underscores the importance of shared duties in spiritual leadership.<p><b>before the tabernacle of the LORD</b><br>The tabernacle was the central place of worship for the Israelites before the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. It housed the Ark of the Covenant and was the focal point of God's presence among His people. The tabernacle's significance is rooted in its role as a meeting place between God and Israel, symbolizing God's covenant and guidance.<p><b>at the high place in Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant location during this period, known for its "great high place" where the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Shiloh. The high place in Gibeon was a temporary worship site until Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem. This location is historically and geographically important, as it was a center of worship and sacrifice, and it highlights the transitional phase in Israel's religious practices from the tabernacle to the Temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_the_priest.htm">Zadok the Priest</a></b><br>A prominent priest during the time of King David and Solomon, Zadok was known for his loyalty and faithfulness.
