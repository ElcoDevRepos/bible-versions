In the context of ancient Israel, the leaders' willingness to contribute to the building of the temple was significant, as it demonstrated their commitment to God and set an example for the nation. This moment is reminiscent of the collective joy seen in <a href="/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20-29</a>, where the Israelites willingly brought offerings for the construction of the Tabernacle. The leaders' actions here can be seen as a type of Christ, who willingly gave Himself for the Church, inspiring His followers to do likewise.<p><b>for they had given to the LORD freely and wholeheartedly</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the nature of the giving, which was both voluntary and sincere. This reflects the biblical principle that God values the heart behind the offering more than the offering itself, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul writes that God loves a cheerful giver. The wholeheartedness of the leaders' giving is a model for Christian stewardship, encouraging believers to give not out of compulsion but out of love and devotion to God.<p><b>And King David also rejoiced greatly</b><br>David's joy underscores his role as a leader who inspires and participates in the worship and service of God. His rejoicing is not just personal but is a reflection of the collective joy of the nation. This moment is significant in the narrative of David's life, as it marks a culmination of his efforts to prepare for the building of the temple, a task that would be completed by his son Solomon. David's joy can be seen as a foreshadowing of the joy found in Christ, who is the ultimate King and temple, bringing together His people in worship and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who is leading the preparations for the building of the temple.

When leaders model surrender, the people find it easier to follow (cf. 2 Chron 31:12; <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual leadership is measured more by example than title.

David later prays, &#8220;I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness&#8221; (1 Chron 29:17).<p>&#8226; Practical take-aways:<p>&#8211; Give first to God, not leftovers (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Give voluntarily, not under pressure (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Give with undivided devotion (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And King David also rejoiced greatly</b><p>&#8226; The shepherd-king shares the people&#8217;s joy, showing unity from throne to commoner.
