He is credited with several Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50, 73</a>-83), which reflect deep theological insights and a heart for worship. The casting of lots was a common biblical practice to discern God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Joseph, likely a descendant of Asaph, signifies the continuation of a godly heritage in worship. The number 12 is significant in Scripture, often representing completeness or the people of God, as seen in the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles. This allocation underscores the organized and divinely ordained nature of worship in the temple.<p><b>the second to Gedaliah, his sons, and his brothers&#8212;12 in all;</b><br>Gedaliah, another leader in the temple worship, represents the next generation of musicians dedicated to the service of God. His name means "Yahweh is great," reflecting the purpose of their ministry. The repetition of "his sons, and his brothers&#8212;12 in all" emphasizes the communal and familial aspect of worship, where entire families were involved in the service of the Lord. This mirrors the New Testament concept of the church as a family of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>). The structure and order in the temple worship prefigure the order and unity expected in the body of Christ, where each member has a role to play (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>A prominent Levite musician and seer in the time of King David, known for his role in leading worship and composing psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Likely a descendant or relative of Asaph, involved in the musical service of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gedaliah.htm">Gedaliah</a></b><br>Another leader of a group of musicians, possibly a descendant of Asaph or another Levite family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_brothers.htm">Sons and Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to the family members and associates of Asaph and Gedaliah who participated in the temple music ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/casting_lots.htm">Casting Lots</a></b><br>A method used in ancient Israel to make decisions or assign duties, believed to reflect God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_music_in_worship.htm">The Role of Music in Worship</a></b><br>Music is a vital part of worship, as seen in the organized structure of temple musicians.<br><br>Reflect on how music enhances your personal and corporate worship experiences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_assignments.htm">God's Sovereignty in Assignments</a></b><br>The casting of lots signifies trust in God's sovereignty over roles and responsibilities.<br><br>Consider how you can trust God in the roles and tasks He assigns to you.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_and_ministry.htm">Family and Ministry</a></b><br>The involvement of sons and brothers highlights the importance of family in ministry.<br><br>Encourage family participation in church activities and spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faithfulness.htm">Legacy of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Asaph's legacy continued through his descendants, emphasizing the impact of faithful service.<br><br>Reflect on the legacy you are building through your service and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_25_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 25:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Chr_25_9_s_role_in_orderly_worship.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 25:9 emphasize the importance of orderly worship in church?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Casting_lots_role_in_worship_leadership.htm">What role does casting lots play in God's plan for worship leadership?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_1_Chronicles_25_9_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of fairness from 1 Chronicles 25:9 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/1_Chr_25_9_s_link_to_worship_in_Bible.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 25:9 connect to other scriptures about worship organization?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_control_in_casting_lots.htm">What can we learn about God's sovereignty from the casting of lots here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_cast_lots_for_temple_musicians_2.htm">What is the significance of casting lots in 1 Chronicles 25:9 for temple musicians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Chr_25_9_s_role_in_Israel_s_worship.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 25:9 reflect the organization of worship in ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_choose_Asaph_Heman_Jeduthun_s_sons.htm">Why were the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun chosen in 1 Chronicles 25:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_chronicles_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Chronicles 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_asaph_write_psalm_79_posthumously.htm">If Psalm 79 is attributed to Asaph (Psalm 79:1), how could he have written it about events that occurred centuries after his lifetime? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/solomon's_horse_stalls_count.htm">How many stalls of horses did Solomon have?

By beginning with &#8220;the first lot,&#8221; the writer underscores God&#8217;s orderly arrangement of worship&#8212;no favoritism, no political maneuvering, just divine direction (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>; <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Lots made sure every family accepted God&#8217;s choice without dispute.<p>&#8226; The sequence of lots becomes a template for fairness in service, echoing Joshua&#8217;s allotment of land (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which was for Asaph</b><p>Asaph had already been identified as a chief musician appointed by David (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4-5</a>). Mentioning him here highlights continuity: the same family that had faithfully served in earlier worship now receives the very first assignment in the new rotation (<a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a> title; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors consistent, generational faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Asaph&#8217;s songs often call worshipers to remember God&#8217;s works; fittingly, his line leads the new schedule of praise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fell to Joseph</b><p>&#8220;Fell to Joseph&#8221; shows that within Asaph&#8217;s clan, the individual leader for this first division is Joseph. The lot &#8220;falls,&#8221; again stressing God&#8217;s hand. Joseph steps into a role of responsibility similar to his ancestor (compare <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>&#8212;another Joseph whose circumstances were directed by God).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty works through seemingly random moments.<p>&#8226; Individual gifting is recognized within a larger family calling (<a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his sons, and his brothers&#8212;12 in all</b><p>Each division consists of twelve, mirroring the twelve tribes (<a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>) and the twelve loaves of showbread (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-6</a>). The number points to wholeness and representation before God.<p>&#8226; Worship leadership is ministry shared across generations&#8212;sons and brothers serve side by side (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Twelve musicians ensure round-the-clock praise when all twenty-four courses rotate (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-31.htm">1 Chronicles 25:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the second to Gedaliah</b><p>The text pivots: &#8220;the second to Gedaliah.&#8221; Gedaliah comes from another musical house (likely Jeduthun&#8217;s, <a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a>). The second lot shows God&#8217;s equal favor across different families, preventing rivalry (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Order continues: first Asaph&#8217;s line, then another&#8212;God values variety in unity.<p>&#8226; Every family&#8217;s assignment is distinct yet equally important, like the Levites&#8217; varied duties (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his sons, and his brothers&#8212;12 in all</b><p>Again the phrase repeats&#8212;twelve dedicated musicians. Repetition drives home that each division, though from different families, receives identical resources and responsibility (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Equality in numbers fosters harmony; no group feels superior or neglected.<p>&#8226; The identical count reinforces that worship is not a competition but a coordinated offering (<a href="/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/25-9.htm">1 Chronicles 25:9</a> illustrates God&#8217;s meticulous, impartial organization of temple music. By casting lots, He assigns the first course to Asaph&#8217;s descendant Joseph and the second to Gedaliah, giving each an equal team of twelve. The verse assures us that:<p>&#8226; God personally oversees worship structure.<p>&#8226; Faithful families are honored, yet every group receives equal standing.<p>&#8226; Order and equality in ministry promote unity and unceasing praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph.</span>--See <a href="/1_chronicles/25-2.htm" title="Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.">1Chronicles 25:2</a>, according to which Joseph was the second "son" of Asaph. Although not stated in the text, it must have been true of Joseph as of all the following heads, that "he, and his sons and his brethren were twelve." The specified total of 288 (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-7.htm" title="So the number of them, with their brothers that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.">1Chronicles 25:7</a>) requires it.<p><span class= "bld">The second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Gedaliah was the second, he and his brethren and his sons</span>--<span class= "ital">twelve.</span> The "brethren" and "sons" of the chiefs, in this and the following verses, are the eleven masters, or proficients, in each class.<p><span class= "bld">Brethren.</span>--Fellow-clansmen, or associates.<p><span class= "bld">Sons.</span>--Disciples, or subordinates.<p>Perhaps, however, we should think of elder and younger families, grouped together in one class.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-31.</span> <span class="accented">- List of the choirs in the order in which their lots came.</span> The formula, <span class="cmt_word">his sons, and his brethren</span>, which follows twenty-two out of the twenty-four leaders' names which now come before us, is absent from ver. 9, where we should have looked for it, viz. after the name <span class="cmt_word">Joseph</span>. It has been supposed that this is a mere omission of carelessness. But this can scarcely be asserted conclusively. It is observable, for instance, that the order of the formula in the same verse, on occasion of its very first occurrence, is not identical with the other twenty-two instances of it, the word "brethren" preceding "sons," and the pronoun "he" being expressed. The preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>) is sometimes expressed and sometimes not expressed before both the proper names and the ordinal numerals of the list. Examination of the contents of these verses shows, either that it was due to the Divine direction of the lot (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>) that an issue resulted which looks so unlike mere chance, and the system of which is so methodical and traceable; or that the lot-taking was not one of families and sons, all thrown together from the first. This supposition would, of course, leave room for some such ingenious hypothesis as that of Berthean, too artificial by far to be defensible except as a theory that would indeed work out the result. He suggests that the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> was by two urns, one for the first seven odd numbers, into which were put the names of Asaph's four sons and of the second, third, and fourth of Heman; the other for the first seven even numbers, into which were put the six sons of Jeduthun and the first of Heman. Turning from such a concocted theory to these verses, we find that the first cast brings to the surface the <span class="accented">second</span> son of Asaph, and the second cast brings up the eldest son of Jeduthun. At the end of the seventh all of Asaph's sons are exhausted, and what would have been his next place (the ninth) is occupied by the second son of Heman, whose eldest had just taken the sixth place so thrown out by the lot. At the end of the fourteenth throw Jeduthun's six sons are all used up, and all the remaining places belong to Heman's sons, but still in the order in which they are thrown out by the lot. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/25-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
