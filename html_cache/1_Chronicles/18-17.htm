He was the son of Jehoiada, a priest, which indicates a lineage of religious and military significance. Benaiah's exploits are detailed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>, where he is noted for his valiant deeds, including killing two Moabite warriors and a lion. His role as a leader reflects the importance of strong, faithful individuals in positions of authority within the kingdom.<p><b>was over the Cherethites and Pelethites</b><br>The Cherethites and Pelethites were elite groups of warriors who served as David's personal bodyguards. Their origins are somewhat debated, but they are often associated with the Philistines, suggesting that David incorporated foreign mercenaries into his forces, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern kingdoms. This strategic move highlights David's wisdom in securing his reign through a diverse and loyal military force. The presence of these groups underscores the political and military complexities of David's kingdom.<p><b>and David&#8217;s sons were chief officials at the king&#8217;s side</b><br>David's sons held significant positions within his administration, indicating the dynastic nature of his rule. This practice of appointing family members to key roles was typical in ancient monarchies, ensuring loyalty and continuity of governance. However, it also foreshadows potential issues of favoritism and rivalry, as seen later in the conflicts among David's sons, such as Absalom's rebellion.

(Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2Samuel 15:18</a>, where the Cherethites and Pelethites are mentioned along with a corps of Gittites.)

But this theory seems to be opposed to the facts of history. Under the monarchy the priests were brought into close relations with the king, owing to their judicial duties; and the chief priest of a royal sanctuary became one of the great officials of state (<a href="/amos/7-11.htm" title="For thus Amos said, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.">Amos 7:11</a>; <a href="/amos/7-13.htm" title="But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.">Amos 7:13</a>). Such a position would be of sufficient importance to be filled by the princes of the blood. The chronicler, writing from the point of view of a later age, has substituted for the original term a phrase that would not offend contemporary feeling.
