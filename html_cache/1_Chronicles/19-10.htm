This situation highlights the tactical difficulties faced by Israel during this period. The Arameans and Ammonites had formed an alliance against Israel, creating a pincer movement. This reflects the constant threat Israel faced from surrounding nations. Joab's ability to assess the situation quickly is indicative of his military acumen, a necessary trait for leaders in the turbulent times of the united monarchy.<p><b>he selected some of the best men of Israel</b><br>Joab's choice to select the best men underscores the importance of having a skilled and elite force in critical battles. This selection process is reminiscent of Gideon's reduction of his army in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>, where God instructed him to choose only the most capable men. The emphasis on quality over quantity is a recurring theme in biblical warfare, illustrating reliance on God's provision and the importance of leadership and valor.<p><b>and arrayed them against the Arameans</b><br>The Arameans were a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. By arraying his best men against them, Joab demonstrated strategic foresight, understanding the need to confront the most immediate threat. This action reflects the broader biblical narrative of Israel's struggle against formidable foes and the need for divine assistance in overcoming them. The confrontation with the Arameans also foreshadows later conflicts, such as those involving the prophet Elisha, where God's intervention is crucial for Israel's survival.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and strategic mind.
