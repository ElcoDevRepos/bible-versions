Eleazar, one of David's mighty warriors, is noted for his courage and loyalty. The "middle of the field" suggests a central and possibly vulnerable position, indicating their willingness to confront the enemy head-on. This act of taking a stand in the field can be seen as a demonstration of faith and reliance on God's strength, reminiscent of other biblical figures who stood firm in the face of overwhelming odds, such as Joshua and Caleb.<p><b>and defended it</b><br>The act of defending the field signifies a commitment to protect what God had given them. In the context of ancient warfare, holding one's ground was crucial for victory. This defense can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual warfare, where believers are called to stand firm in their faith. The defense of the field also reflects the broader theme of God's people defending the Promised Land against their enemies, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>They struck down the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent enemy of Israel, often representing opposition to God's purposes. The defeat of the Philistines by Eleazar and David is a testament to God's power working through His chosen leaders. This victory is part of a larger narrative of Israel's struggle against the Philistines, which includes notable events such as David's earlier defeat of Goliath. The Philistines' defeat serves as a reminder of God's promise to deliver His people from their enemies.<p><b>and the LORD brought about a great victory</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the victory was ultimately God's doing, not merely the result of human effort. It underscores the biblical principle that success comes from the Lord, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>, which attributes victory to God's favor rather than human strength. This victory can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where God intervenes to bring about salvation for His people. The acknowledgment of the Lord's role in the victory serves as a reminder of the importance of giving God the glory for all achievements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his leadership, faith, and military prowess.
