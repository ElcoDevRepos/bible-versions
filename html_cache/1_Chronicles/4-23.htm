Pottery was an essential craft in ancient Israel, used for everyday items like storage jars, cooking pots, and lamps. The potter's work is often used metaphorically in Scripture, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>, where God is likened to a potter shaping clay, symbolizing His sovereignty over nations and individuals.<p><b>who lived at Netaim and Gederah</b><br>Netaim and Gederah were locations within the territory of Judah. Gederah is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a> as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. The exact location of Netaim is less certain, but it is believed to be nearby. These towns were likely centers for specific trades, with Gederah possibly being a hub for pottery due to its mention here. The geographical setting indicates a community organized around specific crafts, reflecting the economic and social structures of ancient Israel.<p><b>They lived there in the service of the king</b><br>This phrase suggests that these potters were not merely independent craftsmen but were employed in a royal capacity. Serving the king implies a level of prestige and importance, as their work would have been essential for the needs of the royal household and possibly for temple service. This service to the king can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King, and believers are called to serve Him with their gifts and talents. The concept of serving the king also connects to the broader biblical theme of stewardship and using one's skills for the glory of God and the benefit of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/potters.htm">Potters</a></b><br>Skilled artisans responsible for creating pottery, which was essential for daily life in ancient times.

By naming &#8220;the potters,&#8221; the chronicler reminds us that God records every vocation (cf. <a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-14.htm">1 Corinthians 12:14-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Potters shaped the clay that served daily life and temple worship&#8212;jars for offerings, basins for purification (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah later pictures the Lord as Potter and Israel as clay (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>).
