The temple, built by Solomon, was a central place of worship for the Israelites and was located in Jerusalem. The western side of the temple was significant as it was part of the outer court, which was accessible to the general public, including Gentiles. This area was crucial for the daily operations and rituals conducted by the Levites. The west side of the temple was also associated with the direction of the setting sun, symbolizing the end of the day and often representing completion or fulfillment in biblical symbolism.<p><b>there were four at the highway</b><br>The "four at the highway" likely refers to the number of gatekeepers or guards stationed at a major entrance or thoroughfare leading to the temple. Highways in ancient Israel were important routes for travel and trade, and they often led to significant locations like Jerusalem. The presence of gatekeepers ensured the security and order of those entering the temple area. This setup reflects the organized and structured nature of temple service, as outlined in the duties of the Levites. The number four may symbolize completeness or universality, as seen in other biblical contexts, such as the four corners of the earth.<p><b>and two at the court</b><br>The "two at the court" indicates the presence of two additional gatekeepers or guards stationed within the court itself. This inner area was closer to the temple and required additional security to maintain the sanctity and order of the worship space. The number two often signifies witness or testimony in the Bible, suggesting that these gatekeepers served as witnesses to the activities and rituals performed in the temple. Their role was crucial in ensuring that only those who were ceremonially clean and authorized could approach the sacred areas, maintaining the holiness of the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_court_on_the_west.htm">The Court on the West</a></b><br>This refers to a specific area within the temple complex.

Earlier in the chapter we read, &#8220;These divisions of the gatekeepers&#8230;had duties&#8230;for the house of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12&#8211;13</a>). Their role was practical&#8212;maintaining order and security for daily ministry&#8212;yet deeply spiritual, because <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.&#8221; Like the Levites who &#8220;were entrusted with the work of the courts and the chambers&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>), these gatekeepers modeled faithfulness in seemingly ordinary tasks that supported sacred worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the west</b><p>Mentioning the west situates this duty within the larger layout of Solomon&#8217;s temple. <a href="/exodus/27-12.htm">Exodus 27:12</a> specifies, &#8220;On the west side of the court there shall be hangings of fifty cubits,&#8221; showing that the western boundary mattered just as much as the more famous east-facing entrance (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, where the east can be misused for idolatry). Although the west lay behind the Holy of Holies, it still required vigilant guardianship. God&#8217;s house demanded complete coverage; no side was exempt from careful stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there were four at the highway</b><p>The &#8220;highway&#8221; points to the main public approach that ran along the temple&#8217;s western edge. Stationing four men here (matching the four posted at each of the other principal gates in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a>) ensured that traffic moved in an orderly, reverent manner. Practical benefits:<p>&#8226; Controlled entry kept unclean or unauthorized persons from defiling holy ground (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Clear oversight discouraged theft or disrespect (<a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Visible servants testified that the LORD&#8217;s worship is no casual affair (<a href="/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4</a> echoes Isaiah&#8217;s call to &#8220;prepare the way of the Lord,&#8221; underscoring ordered access to God).<p>The number four also covers every direction outward from this point, picturing complete vigilance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and two at the court</b><p>Beyond the highway, two additional gatekeepers stood right at the courtyard entrance itself.

Their station lay nearer the altar and the inner court, so they acted as a secondary checkpoint. <a href="/john/18-16.htm">John 18:16</a> shows a later courtyard gate where Peter was admitted; the Chronicler&#8217;s arrangement assures that such places remain secure and orderly. <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a> resurfaces here: even a single day in God&#8217;s courts&#8212;kept safe by faithful servants&#8212;is better than a thousand elsewhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a> records a precise staffing order on the temple&#8217;s west side: four gatekeepers at the public roadway and two more at the courtyard entrance. The verse illustrates God&#8217;s concern for both the spiritual and practical integrity of His house. Every side, every gate, and every approach was to be guarded so worship could proceed in holiness and peace.

The meaning of the word is unknown. According to Gesenius (<span class= "ital">Thesaur.</span> p. 1123), "Parw?r" is the right spelling; and the term answers to a Persian word denoting "summer-house," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a building open to light and air. He makes "the Parbar" a cloister running round the court of the Temple, from which the cells were entered.

The recurrence of the number is curious; but its relation to the twenty-four classes of the porters can hardly be determined.
