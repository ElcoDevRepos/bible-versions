This tribe is significant in biblical history as it is the lineage through which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ are born. The mention of Carmi here connects the narrative to the broader genealogical record of the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of lineage and heritage in the biblical narrative.<p><b>Achar:</b><br>Achar is also known as Achan in other biblical passages, such as in the Book of Joshua. The name Achar means "trouble" or "troubler," which is fitting given his actions and their consequences. This name change from Achan to Achar in Chronicles may emphasize the outcome of his actions, highlighting the theme of sin and its repercussions within the community of Israel.<p><b>who brought trouble upon Israel:</b><br>Achar's actions had significant consequences for the entire nation of Israel. His sin of taking devoted things during the conquest of Jericho led to Israel's defeat at Ai, illustrating the biblical principle that individual sin can have communal consequences. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessing and disobedience brings trouble.<p><b>by violating the ban on devoted things:</b><br>The "ban" refers to the herem, a command from God that certain things were to be completely destroyed or devoted to Him during the conquest of Canaan. Achar's violation of this command by taking some of these devoted items for himself was a direct act of disobedience against God's explicit instructions. This act is detailed in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where the consequences of his sin are fully revealed. The devoted things were meant to be a sign of Israel's dedication to God and His holiness, and Achar's actions disrupted this sacred commitment. This incident serves as a warning about the seriousness of sin and the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/carmi.htm">Carmi</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Judah, listed in the genealogies of 1 Chronicles.
