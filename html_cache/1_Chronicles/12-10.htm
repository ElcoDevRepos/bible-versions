This group of warriors is significant because they represent the growing support for David as he was being established as king over all Israel. The name Mishmannah is not widely mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, which suggests that he was a notable figure within this specific context. The order of listing, with Mishmannah as the fourth, indicates a rank or level of importance among the warriors. This reflects the structured nature of David's military organization, which was crucial for his success as a leader. The inclusion of Mishmannah highlights the diversity and strength of David's supporters, who came from various tribes and backgrounds to unite under his leadership.<p><b>Jeremiah the fifth</b><br>Jeremiah, listed as the fifth, is another of David's mighty men. The name Jeremiah is more commonly associated with the prophet who lived much later, but in this context, it refers to a warrior who played a role in David's rise to power. The mention of Jeremiah in this list underscores the importance of loyalty and bravery among David's followers. The ranking as the fifth suggests a position of honor and responsibility within the group. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God raising up leaders and supporters to fulfill His purposes, as seen throughout the narratives of the Old Testament. The presence of warriors like Jeremiah in David's ranks illustrates the fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's kingdom, which ultimately points to the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, who would establish an eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mishmannah.htm">Mishmannah</a></b><br>Mentioned as the fourth in the list of mighty warriors who joined David at Ziklag.

By naming Mishmannah &#8220;the fourth,&#8221; Scripture shows he held the fourth position in command among these elite soldiers, highlighting God-ordained order within David&#8217;s growing army (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a> for God&#8217;s love of order).<p>&#8226; His placement testifies that each role, even when not first, matters in the Lord&#8217;s plan. Like &#8220;Ezer the first&#8221; and &#8220;Obadiah the second,&#8221; Mishmannah&#8217;s rank evidences personal valor (1 Chron 12:14) and unwavering loyalty to the anointed king, foreshadowing the greater loyalty believers owe to Christ, David&#8217;s royal descendant (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The list underscores that God remembers names. Just as <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> carefully records tribal leaders, this brief mention assures modern readers that faithful service&#8212;seen or unseen&#8212;never escapes divine notice (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His inclusion reinforces the prophetic word that Saul&#8217;s kingdom would diminish while David&#8217;s house would grow stronger (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>). Every additional warrior, including Mishmannah, fulfills that promise in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeremiah the fifth</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Jeremiah the fifth&#8221; follows immediately, adding another layer to the structured hierarchy (1 Chron 12:10). The fifth position still carried strategic influence, much like the fifth captain in <a href="/2_kings/25-23.htm">2 Kings 25:23</a>; ranking does not negate significance.<p>&#8226; His name, shared with the later prophet Jeremiah, reminds readers that God often raises multiple servants across generations, each fulfilling a distinct role (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). Here, this Jeremiah&#8217;s role was military, not prophetic, yet still crucial to God&#8217;s covenant purposes.<p>&#8226; The verse sits within a larger passage celebrating courageous men &#8220;whose faces were the faces of lions&#8221; (1 Chron 12:8). Jeremiah exemplified that courage by risking life and reputation to stand with David before David was universally accepted, illustrating steadfast faith (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording Jeremiah as &#8220;the fifth,&#8221; Scripture shows that godly leadership operates in team formation, not isolation. The presence of five ranked officers mirrors other biblical patterns of graded command (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>), revealing that effective ministry and warfare alike require coordinated oversight (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a> with its reference to overseers and deacons).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10</a> literally lists two Gadite captains, Mishmannah and Jeremiah, ranked fourth and fifth among the warriors who defected to David. Their ordered placement underscores God&#8217;s appreciation for structure, teamwork, and individual faithfulness. Every name preserved in this brief verse affirms that the Lord tracks loyal service, orchestrates leadership for His purposes, and steadily builds His kingdom through willing, courageous people who align themselves with His anointed king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Mishmannah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;man&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4925.htm">Strong's 4925: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mishmannah -- one of David's men</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fourth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7243.htm">Strong's 7243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fourth, a fourth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jeremiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;m&#601;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3414.htm">Strong's 3414: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeremiah -- 'Yah loosens', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fifth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2549.htm">Strong's 2549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fifth, a fifth</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 12:10 Mishmannah the fourth Jeremiah the fifth (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/12-9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 12:9"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 12:9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/12-11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 12:11"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 12:11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
