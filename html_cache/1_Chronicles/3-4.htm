Hebron, a significant city in the tribal territory of Judah, was a city of refuge and a Levitical city. It was also the burial place of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which added to its importance. The six sons born to David in Hebron were Amnon, Daniel, Absalom, Adonijah, Shephatiah, and Ithream. Each of these sons played a role in the unfolding narrative of David's family and kingdom, with some, like Absalom and Adonijah, later challenging David's rule. This period in Hebron was foundational for David's consolidation of power and the establishment of his dynasty.<p><b>where he reigned seven years and six months</b><br>David's reign in Hebron lasted seven years and six months, a period during which he was king over the tribe of Judah alone. This timeframe is significant as it represents a transitional phase before he became king over all Israel. The duration of his reign in Hebron is also mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>, highlighting its importance in the biblical narrative. This period allowed David to strengthen his leadership and prepare for his eventual rule over the united kingdom of Israel.<p><b>And David reigned in Jerusalem thirty-three years</b><br>After his reign in Hebron, David moved his capital to Jerusalem, where he reigned for thirty-three years. Jerusalem, a Jebusite city, was strategically located and became the political and spiritual center of Israel. David's capture of Jerusalem and establishment of it as the capital is a pivotal moment in biblical history, as it became the City of David and later the site of Solomon's Temple. The number thirty-three is often seen as significant in biblical numerology, symbolizing a complete and divinely appointed period. David's reign in Jerusalem solidified his legacy and set the stage for the future of Israel, with Jerusalem remaining central in biblical prophecy and typology, often seen as a type of the eternal kingdom of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his significant role in the history of Israel.
