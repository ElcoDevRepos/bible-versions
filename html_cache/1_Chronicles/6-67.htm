It is first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>, where God appeared to Abram and promised the land to his descendants. Shechem later became a city of refuge, a place where those who accidentally committed manslaughter could seek asylum (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). This reflects God's provision for justice and mercy. Shechem was also a central location for covenant renewal, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24</a>, where Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to renew their covenant with God.<p><b>(a city of refuge)</b><br>The concept of cities of refuge is outlined in <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-34</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a>. These cities provided protection for individuals who accidentally killed someone, preventing blood vengeance until a fair trial could be conducted. This system underscores the value God places on justice and mercy, ensuring that the innocent are protected while the guilty are held accountable. The cities of refuge can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers refuge and salvation to those who seek Him.<p><b>with its pasturelands</b><br>Pasturelands were essential for the sustenance of livestock, which were a primary source of wealth and livelihood in ancient Israel. The allocation of pasturelands to the Levites, who were responsible for religious duties and had no inheritance of their own, ensured they could sustain themselves and their families. This provision reflects God's care for those who serve Him and the community.<p><b>in the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim was a fertile and strategically important region in central Israel. It was known for its rugged terrain and was home to several significant biblical events and figures, including Joshua, who was from the tribe of Ephraim. The allocation of land in this region to the Levites highlights the integration of religious and tribal life in Israel, as well as the importance of having spiritual leaders distributed throughout the land.<p><b>and Gezer</b><br>Gezer was an ancient Canaanite city that became part of Israel's territory during the conquest. It is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33 and 12</a>:12 as a city defeated by Joshua. Archaeological excavations have uncovered significant remains, including fortifications and water systems, indicating its importance as a fortified city. Gezer's inclusion in the Levitical cities demonstrates the spread of religious influence throughout Israel and the integration of former Canaanite cities into the Israelite community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A significant city in the hill country of Ephraim, designated as a city of refuge.
