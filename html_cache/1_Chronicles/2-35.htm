This passage highlights a unique situation where Sheshan, having no sons, gives his daughter in marriage to his Egyptian servant, Jarha. This act reflects the cultural and legal practices of inheritance and marriage in ancient Israel, where lineage and property were typically passed through male heirs. The decision to marry his daughter to a servant, especially an Egyptian, underscores the flexibility within the social structures of the time, possibly indicating Jarha's esteemed position within Sheshan's household. This marriage also illustrates the integration of foreigners into Israelite society, a theme seen elsewhere in the Old Testament, such as in the stories of Rahab and Ruth.<p><b>and she bore to him Attai</b><br>The birth of Attai to Sheshan's daughter and Jarha signifies the continuation of Sheshan's lineage despite the absence of a direct male heir. Attai's inclusion in the genealogical record emphasizes the importance of maintaining family lines and inheritance rights. This event also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence in preserving the tribes of Israel, ensuring that each family line continues despite obstacles. The mention of Attai connects to the larger narrative of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, as seen throughout the genealogies in Chronicles, which trace the lineage from Adam through the tribes of Israel, ultimately leading to the lineage of David and the anticipated Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheshan.htm">Sheshan</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Judah, specifically from the family of Jerahmeel.

This tells us:<p>&#8211; Social barriers could be crossed when faith and covenant loyalty were embraced (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48-49</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-8</a>).<p>&#8211; The marriage elevated Jarha from servant status into the covenant family, echoing how God welcomes the outsider who turns to Him (<a href="/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Sheshan&#8217;s action also protected his daughter. Rather than leaving her future uncertain, he provides a husband within his household, mirroring the care seen in Boaz&#8217;s treatment of Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she bore to him Attai</b><p>&#8226; The birth of Attai confirms that Sheshan&#8217;s lineage continues despite the initial absence of sons. Every name in the genealogy, even one mentioned only once, testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness generation after generation (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Attai&#8217;s appearance only here shows that Scripture values every person, not merely the famous. The chronicler includes him because the accuracy of the record matters (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-1.htm">1 Chronicles 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Through this birth the larger line of Judah advances, keeping open the path that will ultimately lead to the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-35.htm">1 Chronicles 2:35</a> records a quiet but significant moment: Sheshan, lacking sons, wisely gives his daughter to his trustworthy Egyptian servant Jarha, and God rewards that decision with a son, Attai. The verse illustrates covenant inclusivity, responsible family stewardship, and the unbroken thread of God&#8217;s purposes in history&#8212;reminding us that every obedient choice, however small, fits into His larger, sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35-41) The line of Sheshan-Jarha is pursued for thirteen generations of direct descent, but nothing is known of any of its members from any other source. Elishama, the last name (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-41.htm" title="And Shallum begat Jekamiah, and Jekamiah begat Elishama.">1Chronicles 2:41</a>), is the twenty-fourth generation specified from Judah. The list thus extends over a period of at least 720 years; and if we reckon from the Exodus (circ. 1330 B.C.), we get B.C. 610 as an approximate date for Elishama. Now an Elishama was living about that time, who is mentioned (<a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>) as one of the princes of Jehoiakim, king of Judah; <a href="/jeremiah/41-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.">Jeremiah 41:1</a> perhaps mentions the same person again, calling him "of the seed of the kingdom." It is at least a coincidence that several of the names recur in the house of David: Nathan (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-36.htm" title="And Attai begat Nathan, and Nathan begat Zabad,">1Chronicles 2:36</a>) in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>; Obed, as David's grandfather in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-12.htm" title="And Boaz begat Obed, and Obed begat Jesse,">1Chronicles 2:12</a>; Azariah, as a byname of King Uzziah, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-12.htm" title="Amaziah his son, Azariah his son, Jotham his son,">1Chronicles 3:12</a>; Shallum, as a son of Josiah, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>; Jekamiah, as a brother of Salathiel (Shealtiel), in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-18.htm" title="Malchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.">1Chronicles 3:18</a>; and Elishama, as a son of David, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-8.htm" title="And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet, nine.">1Chronicles 3:8</a>--a coincidence of six out of thirteen names. The passage Deut. Xxiii. 7, 8 rules that in the third generation persons of Egyptian blood are to be treated as full Israelites.
