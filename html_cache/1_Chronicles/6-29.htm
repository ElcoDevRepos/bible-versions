The Levites were set apart for religious duties, and Merari's descendants were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's structural components, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This role highlights the importance of each family within the tribe of Levi in maintaining the worship practices of Israel. The division of labor among the Levites underscores the organized and communal nature of Israelite worship.<p><b>Mahli:</b><br>Mahli is one of the sons of Merari. His name appears in several genealogical records, emphasizing the continuity and preservation of the Levitical line. The name Mahli means "sick" or "weak," which may reflect the challenges faced by his descendants or the humility required in their service. Mahli's lineage is mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in the book of Ezra, indicating the enduring legacy of his family in the post-exilic community.<p><b>Libni his son:</b><br>Libni, also known as Libnah in some translations, is a descendant of Mahli. His name means "white" or "purity," which could symbolize the purity required of those serving in the tabernacle. The mention of Libni in the genealogies serves to trace the faithful transmission of duties and responsibilities through generations. This continuity is crucial for understanding the stability and order within the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>Shimei his son:</b><br>Shimei is another descendant in the line of Merari. The name Shimei means "heard" or "famous," suggesting that his family may have been well-regarded or that they played a significant role in the community. Shimei's inclusion in the genealogy highlights the importance of each generation in maintaining the worship and service traditions of Israel. The name also appears in other contexts in the Bible, indicating its common use and the potential for multiple individuals with this name.<p><b>Uzzah his son:</b><br>Uzzah, meaning "strength," is noted as a descendant of Shimei. The name is famously associated with the man who touched the Ark of the Covenant and was struck down by God, though this Uzzah is a different individual. The name's meaning reflects the strength and support that the Merarites provided in their service, as they were responsible for the heavy lifting and transportation of the tabernacle's components. This role required physical strength and dedication, symbolizing the spiritual strength needed to uphold God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/merari.htm">Merari</a></b><br>One of the three sons of Levi, the patriarch of the Levites.

The process from Levi to the worthless sons of Samuel, and the utterly unknown names of Jeaterai and Asaiah, reads like an anti-climax.
