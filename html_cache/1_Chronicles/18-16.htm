Zadok, from the line of Eleazar, was a prominent figure who remained loyal to David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>). His lineage continued to serve in the priesthood, eventually becoming the sole priestly line after Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>). Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, represents the line of Ithamar. Abiathar, his father, was the sole survivor of the massacre of the priests at Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>) and served David faithfully until he supported Adonijah instead of Solomon, leading to his removal (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26-27</a>). The dual mention of these priests highlights the transitional period in Israel's religious leadership and foreshadows the eventual establishment of the Zadokite priesthood, which is significant in Ezekiel's temple vision (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>).<p><b>Shavsha was the scribe;</b><br>Shavsha, also known as Seraiah or Sheva in other biblical accounts (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>), held the important administrative role of scribe or secretary in David's court. The scribe was responsible for maintaining official records, drafting royal decrees, and managing correspondence, reflecting the growing complexity of Israel's governance. This position underscores the shift from a tribal confederation to a centralized monarchy. The role of the scribe is crucial in understanding the development of biblical texts and the preservation of Israel's history. The mention of Shavsha in this context highlights the importance of literacy and record-keeping in the administration of the kingdom, which parallels the role of scribes in the New Testament, who were often experts in the Law (<a href="/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_son_of_ahitub.htm">Zadok son of Ahitub</a></b><br>Zadok was a prominent priest during the reign of King David.

The historical development of this title is obscure, and not easy to trace. The use of some form or other of the root is abundantly frequent from the times of the earliest parts of Scripture, in the sense of "numbering," or "declaring," or "recording." Perhaps our title of "secretary" would answer sufficiently to it, and all the better, because the Old Testament scribes were also of different leading kinds, like in some degree to our various secretaries of state. There was the kind of scribe of <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a> - where our Authorized Version is far from the mark, and should rather read "the staff of the scribe," in place of "the pen of the writer" - a military officer, whose duty it was to keep the muster-roll. There was the scribe of <a href="/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a> - a passage which throws light on the former (see also <a href="/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>). There were the scribes of a more literary, lawyer-like, or clerk-like kind, as here, and in the parallel place, and in <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>. In the time of Hezekiah, if not before, the scribes became distinctly a class of men (<a href="/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>); and the times of the Captivity greatly enlarged their importance. Their exact duties in the best times of the monarchy are not laid down, but the dignified place the king's scribe held is evident from the company in which he is placed here and in the parallel passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Zadok</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
