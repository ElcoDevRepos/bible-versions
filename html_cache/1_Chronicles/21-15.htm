The sending of an angel signifies divine judgment, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament, where angels often act as agents of God's will (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>, <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). The context here is David's sin of conducting a census, which was seen as an act of pride and lack of trust in God. Jerusalem, the city chosen by God for His temple, becomes the focal point of this judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of sin even in the most sacred places.<p><b>but as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented from the calamity</b><br>This demonstrates God's mercy and compassion, even in the midst of judgment. The concept of God relenting is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, where God spares Nineveh. It reflects the tension between God's justice and mercy, a recurring theme in the Bible. The Hebrew word for "relented" can also mean "to be moved to pity," showing God's deep compassion for His people.<p><b>and He said to the angel who was destroying the people, &#8220;Enough! Withdraw your hand now!&#8221;</b><br>God's command to the angel to stop the destruction underscores His sovereign control over all events. It also illustrates the power of divine intervention to halt judgment, a theme echoed in the story of Abraham interceding for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>). This moment of divine mercy is pivotal, showing that God's ultimate desire is not to destroy but to restore.<p><b>At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite</b><br>The location is significant both geographically and theologically. The threshing floor of Ornan (also known as Araunah) is on Mount Moriah, the future site of Solomon's temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). This site is rich in biblical history, being the place where Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>). Theologically, it represents a place of sacrifice and atonement, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The presence of the angel at this specific location highlights the transition from judgment to mercy, as David later purchases the site to build an altar to the LORD, averting further disaster (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who commands the angel and shows mercy by relenting from the destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent to execute judgment on Jerusalem but stopped by God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city under threat of destruction due to David's sin of conducting a census.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who sinned by ordering a census, leading to God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah_the_jebusite.htm">Araunah the Jebusite</a></b><br>The owner of the threshing floor where the angel of the LORD was seen, which later becomes the site for David's altar.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>God is in control of all events, including judgment, but His mercy triumphs over judgment.

They were level spots of stamped and well-trodden earth, about fifty feet in diameter, and selected in positions most exposed to the wind, in order to take the advantage of its help in the separating of the grain from the chaff. On these circular spots of hard earth the sheaves of grain, of whatever kind, were distributed in all sorts of disorder. Oxen and other cattle trod them. And sometimes these beasts were driven round and round five abreast. The stalk of the grain was, of course, much bruised and crushed, and the method is described still as of a very rough and wasteful kind. Instruments were also employed, as the "flail" (<a href="/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27, 28</a>); the "sledge," to which possibly reference is made in <a href="/judges/8-7.htm">Judges 8:7, 16</a>, under the name <span class="accented">barkanim</span> (Authorized Version, "briers").
