Damascus was a major city in ancient Syria, known for its strategic location on trade routes. By establishing military outposts, David ensured Israel's influence and security in the region. This action reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to extend Israel's borders (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The presence of garrisons also indicates a shift from mere conquest to sustained governance and influence.<p><b>and the Arameans became subject to David</b><br>The subjugation of the Arameans under David's rule highlights the expansion of his kingdom and the fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel. This submission is not just political but also economic, as it involves the payment of tribute. Historically, the Arameans were a significant power in the region, and their subjection to David underscores the strength and reach of his reign. This event foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, who will have dominion over all nations (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8-11</a>).<p><b>and brought him tribute</b><br>The tribute brought by the Arameans signifies their acknowledgment of David's authority and the economic benefits that flowed into Israel as a result. Tribute was a common practice in the ancient Near East, symbolizing submission and alliance. This influx of wealth contributed to the prosperity of David's kingdom, enabling him to prepare resources for the future construction of the Temple by Solomon. It also reflects the blessings promised to Israel when they followed God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<p><b>So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine favor and guidance that accompanied David's military campaigns. It is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to David, as seen in the Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). The victories are attributed to the LORD, underscoring the belief that success comes from God rather than human strength alone. This divine support prefigures the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, who triumphs over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess and deep relationship with God.

<a href="/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The move widens Israel&#8217;s reach toward the Euphrates, aligning with God&#8217;s earlier promise of territory to Abraham&#8217;s offspring (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; By establishing garrisons, David models wise stewardship of victories God grants&#8212;securing them for future generations and for God&#8217;s greater purposes, including eventual temple preparation (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Arameans became subject to David</b><p>&#8220;and the Arameans became subject to David&#8221;
