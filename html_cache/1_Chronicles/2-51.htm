Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is a significant location in biblical history. It is the birthplace of King David, as well as Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The town's association with bread also foreshadows Jesus as the "Bread of Life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). Bethlehem's historical and geographical context places it in the hill country of Judah, about six miles south of Jerusalem. Archaeological evidence supports its ancient habitation, with findings dating back to the Iron Age. Salma's connection to Bethlehem highlights the town's importance in the lineage of David and the messianic line.<p><b>and Hareph the father of Beth-gader</b><br>Hareph is noted as the father of Beth-gader, a location not as prominently featured in biblical narratives as Bethlehem. The name Hareph means "reproach" or "autumn," and Beth-gader translates to "house of the wall" or "house of the enclosure." While specific details about Beth-gader are sparse, it is likely a town or settlement within the tribal allotment of Judah. The mention of Hareph and Beth-gader in this genealogical record underscores the chronicler's intent to document the descendants of Judah and their settlements, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises to the tribes of Israel. This genealogical detail contributes to the broader narrative of God's covenant faithfulness and the establishment of His people in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/salma.htm">Salma</a></b><br>Salma is identified as the father of Bethlehem.
