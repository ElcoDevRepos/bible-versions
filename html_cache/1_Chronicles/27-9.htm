This system ensured that the kingdom was always protected without overburdening any single group. The sixth month corresponds to the Hebrew month of Elul, which typically falls around August-September in the Gregorian calendar. This month was significant for preparation and reflection, leading up to the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah.<p><b>was Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite</b><br>Ira is identified as the son of Ikkesh and hails from Tekoa, a town in Judah. Tekoa is historically significant, known for its strategic location and its association with the prophet Amos (<a href="/amos/1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). The mention of Ira's lineage and hometown highlights the importance of family and tribal affiliations in Israelite society. It also underscores the diversity within David's army, drawing leaders from various regions and backgrounds.<p><b>There were 24,000 men in his division</b><br>Each division of David's army consisted of 24,000 men, a substantial force that reflects the military strength and organization of Israel under David's reign. This number is consistent across all divisions, indicating a well-planned and balanced military structure. The organization into divisions of 24,000 may symbolize completeness and order, reflecting God's provision and protection over Israel. This structure also foreshadows the New Testament's emphasis on order and unity within the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ira.htm">Ira</a></b><br>A leader of the sixth division of King David's army, serving during the sixth month.
