These men were seasoned soldiers, skilled in battle, and represented a unified military force. Their assembly signifies the widespread support David had among the tribes, highlighting the divine favor and legitimacy of his kingship. The gathering of such a large and diverse group underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>, where David is anointed by Samuel.<p><b>Arrayed for battle</b><br>The men were prepared and equipped for warfare, indicating their readiness to defend David's claim to the throne. This preparation reflects the seriousness of their commitment and the potential for conflict with those loyal to Saul's house. The imagery of being "arrayed for battle" also symbolizes spiritual readiness and the need for believers to be prepared for spiritual warfare, as echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<p><b>Came to Hebron</b><br>Hebron is a significant location in biblical history, being the place where David was first anointed king over Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). It is also associated with the patriarchs, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried there. The choice of Hebron as the gathering place emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant promises and the legitimacy of David's rule. Hebron's strategic location in the tribal territory of Judah further solidified David's initial support base.<p><b>Fully determined to make David king over all Israel</b><br>The phrase indicates a resolute and unified decision among the tribes to establish David as the ruler of the entire nation, not just Judah. This determination reflects the recognition of David's God-given right to the throne, as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>. It also marks the transition from the divided rule under Saul to a united monarchy under David, prefiguring the ultimate unity found in Christ's eternal kingdom.<p><b>And all the rest of the Israelites were of one mind</b><br>This unity among the Israelites signifies a divinely orchestrated consensus, overcoming previous divisions and rivalries. It highlights the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing about harmony and agreement among God's people. This unity is a precursor to the unity of believers in the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>, where the church is called to maintain the unity of the Spirit.<p><b>To make David king</b><br>The anointing of David as king is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, establishing the Davidic dynasty that would ultimately lead to the birth of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.

"They formed in line with fearless intrepidity;" literally, <span class= "ital">corde integro</span>.<p><span class= "bld">And all the rest also of Israel,</span> who did not appear personally at Hebron.--" The rest (<span class= "ital">sh?rith</span>) is a term used here only. The Hebrew says, "the remainder of Israel (was) one heart," i.e., was unanimous. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-12.htm" title="Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.">2Chronicles 30:12</a>.)<p>Allowing the average for Issachar, the total of the warriors assembled at Hebron was upwards of 300,000. This will not surprise us if we bear in mind that in those days every able-bodied man was, as a matter of course, trained in the use of arms, and liable to be called out for the king,s wars. Thus "man" and "warrior" were almost convertible terms. The present gathering was not a parade of the entire strength of the nation; co?np. the 600,000 warriors of the Exodus, and the 1,300,000 of David's census. The main difficulty--that of the relative proportions of the various tribal contingents--has been considered in the preceding Notes. The suggestions there made are, of course, uncertain, the fact being that we really do not know enough of the condition of the tribes at that epoch to justify us in pronouncing upon the relative probability of the numbers here assigned to them. That being so, it is a hasty and uncritical exaggeration to say that "it is absolutely inconceivable that the tribes near the place of meeting, notably that of Judah, should have furnised so small a contingent, while the figures are raised in direct proportion to the distance to be traversed" (Reuss). . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of war,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4421.htm">Strong's 4421: </a> </span><span class="str2">A battle, war</span><br /><br /><span class="word">arrayed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6186.htm">Strong's 6186: </a> </span><span class="str2">To set in a, row, arrange, put in order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for battle,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4634.htm">Strong's 4634: </a> </span><span class="str2">An arrangement, a pile, a military array</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Hebron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#7687;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular &#124;
