He is identified as the brother of Jerahmeel, linking him to the family of Judah. This connection emphasizes the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society, where family ties often determined one's role and inheritance. The mention of Jerahmeel ties Caleb to a broader narrative of the tribe of Judah, which is significant in the biblical story as the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come.<p><b>Mesha his firstborn, who was the father of Ziph:</b><br>Mesha is noted as the firstborn, a position of prominence and responsibility in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The firstborn often received a double portion of the inheritance and carried on the family name. Ziph, his descendant, is associated with a region in the Judean hill country. This area is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/1_samuel/23.htm">1 Samuel 23</a>, where David hides from Saul in the wilderness of Ziph. The geographical reference underscores the historical and strategic significance of these locations in Israel's history.<p><b>and Mareshah his second son, who was the father of Hebron:</b><br>Mareshah, as the second son, is also significant, though typically with less prominence than the firstborn. His connection to Hebron is noteworthy. Hebron is a major city in the biblical narrative, known as the place where Abraham settled and where David was anointed king. It is a city with deep patriarchal roots, being the burial place of the patriarchs and matriarchs.

Caleb here is the son of Hezron (see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>) and thus a brother of Jerahmeel, not the later Caleb son of Jephunneh who spied out Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-6.htm">Numbers 13:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing Caleb alongside Jerahmeel, the text shows how the tribe of Judah branched into distinct clans, each receiving territory God had promised (<a href="/joshua/15-20.htm">Joshua 15:20, 54</a>).<p>&#8226; The detailed genealogy underscores how God keeps covenant promises through real families, tying the nation&#8217;s later history back to its roots in the patriarchs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mesha his firstborn</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Mesha his firstborn,&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>b)<p>&#8226; Being the firstborn, Mesha would carry special responsibility and honor (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; His name heads the list to emphasize the primacy of his line within Caleb&#8217;s descendants, mirroring how earlier genealogies highlight firstborn roles&#8212;e.g., Reuben among Jacob&#8217;s sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s design for ordered family leadership is consistently affirmed, illustrating how He works through established structures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The father of Ziph</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;who was the father of Ziph,&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>c)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Father&#8221; here means clan founder; Ziph became both a person and the town bearing his name in Judah&#8217;s hill country (<a href="/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This town later hosted David while he fled Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14&#8211;19</a>; 26:1), showing how these genealogical notes prepare the backdrop for pivotal biblical events.<p>&#8226; The record confirms the literal, historical connection between people and places God used to advance His redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mareshah his second son</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and Mareshah his second son,&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>d)<p>&#8226; Scripture mentions the second son to stress that significance in God&#8217;s purposes is not limited to firstborns. Just as Joseph (<a href="/bsb/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a> ff.) and Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>) rose to prominence, Mareshah&#8217;s line is also important.<p>&#8226; Mareshah later appears as a fortified city in Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9&#8211;10</a>), reflecting growth from one man to a settlement instrumental in national defense.<p>&#8226; The verse quietly teaches that every member of God&#8217;s covenant family&#8212;whether first or second in birth order&#8212;has a divinely appointed role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The father of Hebron</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;who was the father of Hebron.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>e)<p>&#8226; Hebron, one of Judah&#8217;s chief cities, holds deep biblical resonance: Abraham dwelt there (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>), the patriarchs are buried there (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>), and David was anointed king there (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Linking Hebron to Mareshah confirms the literal origin of this influential city within Caleb&#8217;s broader family.<p>&#8226; The text also ties back to God&#8217;s promise that Judah would lead (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8&#8211;10</a>); Hebron&#8217;s prominence in Judah&#8217;s territory demonstrates that promise fulfilled through real descendants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a> anchors key Judean towns&#8212;Ziph and Hebron&#8212;in the literal descendants of Caleb son of Hezron. By naming Mesha and Mareshah, Scripture shows how God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness flows through specific families, honors both firstborn and later-born children, and lays geographical foundations for future redemptive events. Genealogies like this, far from being dry lists, testify to God&#8217;s meticulous care in shaping history to accomplish His purposes through His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42-55) These verses revert to the Calebite stocks. Interpreted as merely bearing upon the extraction of individuals about whom, for the most part, nothing whatever is known beyond what these brief notices reveal, the section presents great difficulties. The key to it appears to be the assumption that it is an ancient record of the relations between certain great branches of the tribe of Judah, and their various settlements; in other words, these lists are tribal and topographical, rather than genealogical.<p><span class= "bld">I.--</span><a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-42.htm" title="Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.">1Chronicles 2:42-45</a> : Caleb brother of Jerahmeel = Caleb son of Hezron (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-18.htm" title="And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth: her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon.">1Chronicles 2:18</a>) = Chelubai (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm" title="The sons also of Hezron, that were born to him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai.">1Chronicles 2:9</a>).<p>(42) <span class= "bld">Mesha.</span>--The name of a king of Moab (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2Kings 3:4</a>), whose monument of victory, the famous Moabite stone, was found in 1868 at Dibou.

This statement would lead us to suppose that we were assuredly reading of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; but it cannot be so. The name of Caleb, with the questions gathering round it, will be best considered here. Of the nine times in which it occurs in this chapter, the mere duplicates (of vers. 20, 46, 48) may be at once counted off. The compound "Caleb-ephratah" of ver. 24 has been already dealt with. Nor need we for the present suppose ver. 50 to have any real meaning inconsistent with its apparent meaning, viz. that Caleb is the name of a grandson (son of Hut) as well as of the grandfather. There remain the occasions of the occurring of the word in vers. 9, 18, 42, 49. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The first appearance, then, of the name in this chapter (ver. 9) exhibits it in a form different from that in which it appears the other times in this chapter or elsewhere, viz. as <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> (or once as a patronymic, <a href="/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). The Vulgate follows the Hebrew, but the Septuagint has at once substituted Caleb. The Syriac Version has Salchi, and the Arabic Sachli, both of them, no doubt, mere transcribers' errors through the mistake of a letter. This form "Chelubai" is, then, an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and no different account has yet been given of the name appearing thus on this one occasion. It may be described, with Lange ('Comm. Old Testament,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>), as "adjectivus gentilis" to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, which word, however, occur where it will, is never treated as a synonym with Caleb except by the Septuagint, and then but once (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-11.htm">1 Chronicles 4:11</a>), making Lange's further claim of <span class="accented">three</span> forms for the name of Caleb wrong. The name might be translated the "Cheluban" or "Chelubite." <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The Caleb called here first "Chelubai," again" Caleb the son of Hezron," and now "Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel," some, and Keil among them, have endeavoured to identify with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. This latter is a well-known figure in history. He, together with Joshua, was among those who, departing from Egypt, were pursued of Pharaoh, and of all the host these two alone lived to enter into the promised land. This is enough to give him distinction and a prominent place before the eye. To this Caleb unmistakable reference is made in twenty-eight passages, in sixteen of which he is called "son of Jephunneh," and in three of those sixteen "son of Jephunneh the Kenazite." Now, he tells us himself (<a href="/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>) that he was forty years old in the seceded year after the Exodus. But it seems (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12, 26</a>) that Hezron, grandson of Judah, and the father of the Caleb of this chapter, was, however young, one of those who went down into Egypt with Jacob, at a date, according to any chronology, which must render it impossible for any son of his to have been alive and only forty years of age at the time of the Exodus. This being so, either the statement already referred to, found at the close of ver. 49, that "the daughter of Caleb was Achsa," must be an interpolation from some ignorant transcriber's marginal annotation, or, unlikely as it is, Caleb the son of Hezron and Caleb the son of Jephunneh both named a daughter Achsa. It is, moreover, likely enough that the frequent describing of Caleb the son of Jephuuneli in this style was occasioned by the desire to distinguish him from some other Caleb, <span class="accented">not</span> a contemporary, indeed, but already well known m a generation preceding but not too remote. Other considerations decidedly concur with this view: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ram is <span class="accented">brother</span> of Caleb the son of Hezron; he has a grandson, Nahshon, of great distinction," a prince of the children of Judah," whose sister Aaron married; he was the elect of the Judah tribe to assist Moses and Aaron in the first numbering of the people (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>). Great prominence is given to him (<a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>). He was clearly (<a href="/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>; <a href="/luke/3-32.htm">Luke 3:32</a>) fifth in descent from Judah, in perfect agreement with the table of this chapter. Now, it was this <span class="accented">grandson</span> of the <span class="accented">elder</span> brother of Caleb who was contemporary with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. Similarly, the Bezaleel of this chapter (ver. 20), a great-grandson of Caleb the Hezronite, is spoken of (<a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>) at the same date exactly at which Caleb the son of Jephunneh says he was still but forty years of age l <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The identity of the Caleb of ver. 50, son of Hut, with Caleb the son of Jephuuneh is supposed by some, but is not clear. It appears to be asserted, without explanation, in the arts. "Caleb" and "Ephrath," signed A. C. H., Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' though in the second part of the latter article it is alluded to as only possible. On the other hand, it may rather be that Caleb the son of Jephunneh, instead of being identical with this Caleb the son of Hur, is so called in order to distinguish him from this latter as a contemporary. Again, it has been happily conjectured ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that just as ver. 33 closes the table of Jerahmeel with "<span class="cmt_word">These were the sons of Jerahmeel</span>," so ver. 49 should close the table of Caleb (ver. 42) with the words, These were the Boris of Caleb. With a slight alteration, ver. 50 would then begin <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Hur</span>, etc. This is, however, only conjecture. Ver. 42, then, must be considered to give us another family of Caleb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a family by another wife, of name not given, just possibly the Jerioth unaccounted for in ver. 18. The first statement lauds us in perplexity. <span class="cmt_word">Mesha</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) is the <span class="cmt_word">firstborn</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the wife or woman in question), and the <span class="cmt_word">founder of Ziph</span>. And amid some omission or corruption of text, we are then confronted with the words, <span class="cmt_word">and the sons of Marsehah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the father</span> (or again, perhaps <span class="accented">founder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of Hebron</span>. The reading of the Septuagint gives Mareshah in <span class="accented">both</span> of these passages, and may come from a Hebrew text that we have not. The substitution could, however, scarcely be accounted for as a <span class="accented">mere</span> clerical error, considering both the omission of a <span class="accented">resh</span> and the replacing of an <span class="accented">he</span> with an <span class="accented">ayin.</span> The sentence refuses at present any treatment except the unsatisfactory one of pure conjecture. But employing this, it may be noted that the omitting of the words, "the sons of," before Mareshah would most help to clear the verse of confusion. In this and following verses, <span class="cmt_word">Ziph, Hebron, Tappuah, Jorkoam,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Beth-zur,</span> are all names of places certainly, whether or not they are all of persons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
