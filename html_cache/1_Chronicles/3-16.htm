His reign is noted for its political instability and spiritual decline, as he did not follow the ways of the Lord. This phrase introduces the lineage of Jehoiakim, highlighting the continuation of the Davidic line despite the challenges faced during his reign. The mention of successors emphasizes the importance of lineage and the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his descendants would continue to rule.<p><b>Jeconiah his son:</b><br>Jeconiah, also known as Jehoiachin, was the son of Jehoiakim and reigned for a brief period before being taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. His reign marked the beginning of the Babylonian exile, a significant event in Jewish history. Jeconiah's captivity fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, who warned of the consequences of Judah's disobedience. Despite his captivity, Jeconiah is listed in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Matthew, indicating the continuation of the Davidic line and God's faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>and Zedekiah:</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the final Babylonian conquest. He was Jehoiakim's brother and was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar. His reign ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, leading to the complete exile of the Jewish people. Zedekiah's reign is often seen as a period of missed opportunities for repentance and reform. His failure to heed prophetic warnings, particularly from Jeremiah, resulted in the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the fall of Jerusalem. Zedekiah's story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of ignoring God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>He was a king of Judah, the son of Josiah, and father of Jeconiah.

That curse pushed the royal line toward exile and away from immediate kingship, yet the genealogy keeps him in place to show God still tracking the line.<p>&#8226; Even in captivity the Lord preserved him; years later the Babylonian king released him and &#8220;set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31-34</a>). God was signaling future hope.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/1-11.htm">Matthew 1:11-12</a> echoes Chronicles by placing Jeconiah in Jesus&#8217; legal ancestry, affirming that the Messiah would come through this apparently broken branch.

Multiple sons bearing similar or identical names is common in royal families (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Chronicles lists him to show Jehoiakim fathered more than one heir, reinforcing the idea that God preserved viable branches of the Davidic line.<p>&#8226; That second listing also underlines how succession plans can be complex in times of upheaval. While Jeconiah went to Babylon, another son remained, ensuring the line could not be stamped out by a single deportation or execution (<a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Zedekiah&#8217;s quiet placement whispers a lesson: even when history highlights only the most visible figures, God remembers every link in the chain (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> briefly records Jehoiakim&#8217;s two successors&#8212;Jeconiah and Zedekiah&#8212;to demonstrate that, in spite of judgment and exile, God faithfully guarded David&#8217;s dynasty. Jeconiah&#8217;s cursed kingship and exile could not cancel the covenant; Zedekiah&#8217;s understated mention shows additional protection for the line. Together they reassure readers that God tracks every generation, keeping His promises until the ultimate Son of David, Jesus, appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Jeconiah</span> (<span class= "ital">Iah establish</span> <span class= "ital">!</span>)= Jehoiachin (<span class= "ital">Iahweh establisheth</span>)<span class= "ital"> =</span> Coniah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm" title="As I live, said the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>--an abbreviation of Jeconiah), was carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm" title="And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.">2Kings 24:15</a>), and Zedekiah his father's brother, became king in his stead. Hence the supposition that "Zedekiah his son" means "Zedekiah his successor" on the throne. (Comp. margin.) But (1) the phrase "his son" has its natural sense throughout the preceding list; and (2) there really is nothing against the apparent statement of the text that Jeconiah the king had a son named Zedekiah, after his great-uncle. As, like Johanan (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>), he did not come to the throne, this younger Zedekiah is not mentioned elsewhere. (See <a href="/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1Chronicles 3:17</a>, Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Of the above four brothers, sons of Josiah, the second, Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, had a son called <span class="cmt_word">Jeconiah</span>, or Jehoiachin - essentially the same word. He was eighteen years of age when he succeeded his father (<a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>). A touching glimpse is given of him in <a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. His name is shortened to Coniah in <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a> and Jeremiah 37:1, though elsewhere in the same prophet, Jeconiah, and in one place (<a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), Jehoiachin. The name of <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span> occasions difficulty in this verse. In the first instance, following the examples of vers. 10-14, we should presume that this Zedekiah is set forth as a son of Jeconiah, and as it is not said that he <span class="accented">reigned</span> after Jeconiah (for it was undoubtedly Jeconiah's uncle Zedekiah who reigned after him), we need only have read it as a statement of one of his sons. Against this, however, there are two tolerably decisive considerations; for, <span class="accented">first</span>, the verse opens confessedly by offering us <span class="cmt_word">sons of Jehoiakim</span>, and these two, Jeconiah and Zedekiah, will fulfil the promise of that plural; and again, the seventeenth verse enters upon the formal enumeration of <span class="accented">sons to</span> Jeconiah. The question, therefore, returns - Who was this Zedekiah, <span class="accented">son</span> of Jehoiakim? Some consider him identical with the Zedekiah of the previous verse, and that "his son" means here "his successor." This undoes fewer difficulties than it makes. If the text be not corrupt, the likeliest solution is to suppose that this Zedekiah of ver. 16 is an otherwise unknown brother of Jeconiah, and son of Jehoiakim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The successors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jehoiakim:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3079.htm">Strong's 3079: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoiakim -- 'the LORD raises up', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jeconiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3204.htm">Strong's 3204: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeconiah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his son,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] Zedekiah.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;i&#7695;&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6667.htm">Strong's 6667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zedekiah -- 'Yah is righteousness', six Israelites</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 3:16 The sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 3:15"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 3:15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 3:17"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 3:17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
