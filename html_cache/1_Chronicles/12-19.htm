This defection signifies a shift in loyalty from Saul, the reigning king, to David, who was anointed by God to be the next king. The defection of these warriors highlights the growing support for David among the tribes of Israel, indicating divine favor and the fulfillment of God's promise to David. This act of defection can be seen as a type of the gathering of believers to Christ, the true anointed King.<p><b>when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul.</b><br>David's alliance with the Philistines was a strategic move during a time when he was fleeing from Saul. The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, and David's presence among them was a complex situation. This phrase underscores the tension and danger David faced, as he was caught between his loyalty to Israel and his need for refuge. It also reflects the providential protection over David, as God used even his enemies to preserve him.<p><b>(They did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away,</b><br>The Philistine rulers' decision to send David away was a result of their suspicion and fear that he might turn against them in battle. This consultation among the Philistine lords demonstrates the political and military caution of the time. It also shows God's intervention, as David was spared from fighting against his own people, which would have been a significant moral and political dilemma.<p><b>saying, &#8220;It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.&#8221;)</b><br>The Philistine rulers' fear of David defecting back to Saul highlights David's reputation as a formidable warrior and leader. Their concern for their own safety ("It will cost us our heads") indicates the high stakes of ancient warfare and the precarious nature of alliances. This phrase also foreshadows David's eventual kingship, as even his enemies recognized his potential to lead and influence. The situation reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty in guiding and protecting His chosen leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who was at this time fleeing from King Saul and seeking refuge among the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, some members of which defected to David during his time with the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people often at war with Israel, among whom David sought refuge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers_of_the_philistines.htm">Rulers of the Philistines</a></b><br>Leaders who decided not to allow David to fight with them, fearing he might turn against them in battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership_transitions.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership Transitions</a></b><br>Despite human plans and fears, God's purposes prevail.
