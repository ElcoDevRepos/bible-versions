The Levites were set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle and later the temple. This lineage is significant as it highlights the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood and their roles in Israelite worship. The mention of Mahli connects to the broader narrative of the division of Levitical duties, as outlined in <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-24</a>, emphasizing the importance of order and structure in worship.<p><b>Eleazar:</b><br>Eleazar, in this context, is a descendant of Mahli. The name Eleazar means "God has helped," which is a common name in the Old Testament, including the notable Eleazar, son of Aaron, who was a high priest. This Eleazar, however, is distinct and is part of the genealogical record that underscores the continuity and faithfulness of God's people in maintaining their priestly duties. The name itself reflects a reliance on divine assistance, a theme prevalent throughout the scriptures.<p><b>Who had no sons:</b><br>The mention that Eleazar had no sons is significant in the context of inheritance and the continuation of family lines, especially among the Levites, where duties and responsibilities were often passed down through generations. In biblical times, having no male heirs could affect the distribution of duties and the maintenance of family legacy. This detail may also highlight the providence of God in ensuring that the priestly functions continued through other family members, as seen in the broader narrative of the Levites. It also reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty in family and lineage, where God&#8217;s purposes are fulfilled despite human limitations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mahli.htm">Mahli</a></b><br>Mahli is a descendant of Levi, one of the sons of Merari.

Mahli is first mentioned in <a href="/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20</a> as a grandson of Levi.<p>&#8226; Throughout the Chronicler&#8217;s record (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-19.htm">1 Chronicles 6:19</a>; 23:21), Mahli&#8217;s branch is highlighted to show how every Levitical family contributed to worship in the temple.<p>&#8226; By repeating Mahli&#8217;s name here, the text underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve even lesser-known clans for His service (compare <a href="/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16&#8211;19</a>, where each Levitical line is noted).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eleazar</b><p>&#8226; The phrase then focuses: &#8220;Eleazar.&#8221; This Eleazar is a descendant of Mahli, distinct from Eleazar the son of Aaron (<a href="/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; His inclusion illustrates that every individual within the Levitical genealogy mattered for temple duties (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Through this single name, the text reminds readers that service to God is not limited to the well-known; even seemingly obscure figures are recorded in Scripture for eternal remembrance (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had no sons</b><p>&#8226; The verse concludes, &#8220;who had no sons,&#8221; noting a break in male succession.

It situates us in Mahli&#8217;s Levitical line, singles out Eleazar as a valued servant, and explains why his branch did not add a division to temple service&#8212;he left only daughters.
