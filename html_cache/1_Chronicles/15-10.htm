This places the Uzzielites within the Levitical tribe, specifically among the Kohathites, who had specific duties related to the tabernacle and later the temple. The Kohathites were responsible for carrying the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, highlighting the importance of their role in Israelite worship. This connection underscores the significance of the Uzzielites in the religious life of Israel.<p><b>Amminadab the chief</b><br>Amminadab is identified as the leader of the Uzzielites in this context. The role of a chief or leader among the Levites was crucial, as they were responsible for organizing and overseeing the duties of their family group.

In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/15.htm">1 Chronicles 15</a>, these relatives would have been involved in the transportation and care of the Ark of the Covenant as it was brought to Jerusalem.
