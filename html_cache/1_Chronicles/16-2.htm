The burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God. Peace offerings, also known as fellowship offerings, were shared between the offerer, the priests, and God, symbolizing reconciliation and communion. This act of worship took place after the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem, signifying God's presence among His people. The sacrifices were a means of expressing gratitude and seeking God's favor, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This event parallels the dedication of the temple by Solomon, where similar offerings were made (<a href="/2_chronicles/7.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1-5</a>).<p><b>he blessed the people</b><br>David, as both king and spiritual leader, pronounced a blessing over the people. This act was a common practice among leaders in Israel, signifying the transmission of God's favor and protection. The blessing was not merely a wish but an invocation of God's presence and provision. It reflects the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the priests were instructed to bless the Israelites. David's blessing would have been a moment of communal joy and spiritual renewal, reinforcing the unity and identity of the nation under God's covenant.<p><b>in the name of the LORD</b><br>The use of "the LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. Invoking God's name in a blessing signifies authority and the assurance that the blessing is backed by God's power and faithfulness. The name of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, representing His character and presence. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative where God's name is associated with His acts of salvation and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a> and throughout the Psalms. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of doing all things in the name of Jesus Christ (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>), who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and leadership.

He waited until the sacrifices were complete before turning to the people, demonstrating that God must receive priority. <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38&#8211;42</a> shows that sacrifices framed Israel&#8217;s daily relationship with the LORD, and David follows that pattern here. His actions remind us that ministry to others flows out of ministry to God (cf. <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the burnt offerings</b><p>&#8226; A burnt offering was wholly consumed on the altar (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>), symbolizing total surrender to God.<p>&#8226; By offering these, David publicly declared that both he and the nation belonged entirely to the LORD (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> picks up the same idea for believers today).<p>&#8226; The presence of the ark made this moment especially significant; God&#8217;s throne in Israel was being acknowledged with wholehearted devotion (<a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and peace offerings</b><p>&#8226; Peace (or fellowship) offerings were shared meals between worshiper, priest, and God (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Including them signaled joyful communion, not merely duty. The nation was celebrating restored fellowship after the earlier mishandling of the ark (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-10.htm">1 Chronicles 13:10-12</a>; 15:13).<p>&#8226; The same pairing of burnt and peace offerings appears at Solomon&#8217;s temple dedication (<a href="/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-63</a>), framing sacred milestones with surrender and fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he blessed the people</b><p>&#8226; Once worship was complete, David turned to the congregation &#8220;and blessed them in the name of the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors the priestly pattern: &#8220;So they shall put My name on the Israelites, and I will bless them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>). Although David was king, he took on a priest-like role, foreshadowing Christ the King-Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Blessing the people underscored that reverent leaders channel God&#8217;s favor to those they serve (<a href="/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55-56</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the name of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Acting &#8220;in the name of the LORD&#8221; means in His authority and for His glory (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s words were not empty wishes; they carried the covenant promise that God Himself would prosper His people (<a href="/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Today believers are urged, &#8220;Whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>), reflecting the same principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a> captures a pattern worth imitating: wholehearted worship first, joyful fellowship second, and then Spirit-filled blessing poured out on others&#8212;all carried out under the authority of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The burnt offerings.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the burnt offering,</span> as if one great holocaust were meant.
