Obed-edom was a Gittite, possibly indicating he was from Gath, a Philistine city, or a Levite from the Levitical city of Gath-rimmon. The ark's stay for three months signifies a period of divine testing and blessing, reminiscent of other biblical periods of three months, such as Moses' concealment as a baby (<a href="/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2</a>) and Mary's visit to Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-56.htm">Luke 1:56</a>). This time frame underscores God's grace and the importance of proper reverence and handling of sacred objects.<p><b>and the LORD blessed his household and everything he owned</b><br>The blessing upon Obed-edom's household is a testament to the tangible benefits of God's presence. This blessing echoes the Abrahamic promise of blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>) and foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as temples of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). The comprehensive nature of the blessing, extending to everything he owned, highlights God's abundant provision and favor. It serves as a contrast to the earlier incident where Uzzah was struck down for irreverence (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-10.htm">1 Chronicles 13:10</a>), emphasizing the importance of obedience and reverence in experiencing God's blessings. This narrative also prefigures the blessings found in Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed-edom.htm">Obed-edom</a></b><br>A Levite from the family of Korah, who was entrusted with the care of the Ark of the Covenant.
