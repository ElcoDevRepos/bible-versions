In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/17.htm">1 Chronicles 17</a>, King David is responding to God's covenant promise, acknowledging God's unparalleled nature. This echoes the monotheistic belief central to Israel's faith, distinguishing Yahweh from the polytheistic deities of surrounding nations. The phrase aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>, which also declare God's uniqueness and supremacy.<p><b>and there is no God but You</b><br>This statement reaffirms the monotheistic foundation of Israel's faith, contrasting with the prevalent polytheism of the ancient Near East. It underscores the exclusivity of Yahweh as the one true God, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament. This declaration is consistent with the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one," which is a central tenet of Jewish belief and practice.<p><b>according to everything we have heard with our own ears</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of oral tradition and the transmission of faith through generations. In ancient Israel, the recounting of God's mighty acts and promises was a key method of preserving and reinforcing faith. The phrase suggests a collective witness to God's deeds, as seen in the recounting of Israel's history and God's covenantal faithfulness. It also points to the reliability of the testimony about God, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>, where the psalmist speaks of the stories passed down from ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is expressing his awe and reverence for God in this passage.

This simple address reminds us:<p>&#8226; He is the &#8220;I AM WHO I AM&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His name is majestic in all the earth (<a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; We belong to Him; &#8220;Know that the LORD is God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>).<p>Whenever Scripture opens with this title, we are invited to slow down and recognize the One who has revealed Himself personally and faithfully to His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is none like You</b><p>David moves from address to admiration. He is saying God is utterly without equal.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Who among the gods is like You, O LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord, nor works like Yours&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God Himself asks, &#8220;To whom will you compare Me, or who is My equal?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>).<p>These verses underline every attribute&#8212;holiness, power, love, wisdom&#8212;as matchless. No rival can be found because none exist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there is no God but You</b><p>David shifts from uniqueness to exclusiveness.

He alone is Creator, Sustainer, Redeemer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to everything we have heard with our own ears</b><p>David roots his praise in historical, experiential evidence.
