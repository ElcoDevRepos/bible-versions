They were a sea-faring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their conflict with Israel is a recurring theme, highlighting the struggle between the people of God and pagan nations. This battle is part of a larger narrative of Israel's ongoing struggle to maintain their covenantal land against foreign powers. The Philistines' advanced military technology, including iron weaponry, often gave them an advantage over Israel.<p><b>and the men of Israel fled before them</b><br>The Israelites' retreat indicates a moment of national crisis and divine judgment. In the context of 1 Chronicles, this defeat is seen as a consequence of Israel's disobedience and the failure of their leadership under King Saul. The flight of the Israelite army contrasts with earlier victories under leaders like Joshua, where faithfulness to God led to triumph. This phrase underscores the importance of divine favor in Israel's military success.<p><b>and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa</b><br>Mount Gilboa is a significant geographical location in the biblical narrative. It is situated in the northern part of Israel, near the Jezreel Valley. The defeat and death of Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa mark a turning point in Israel's history, leading to the rise of David as king. This event fulfills the prophecy given to Saul by the prophet Samuel, indicating the end of Saul's reign due to his disobedience. The tragedy on Mount Gilboa serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel throughout the Old Testament, known for their military prowess and frequent conflicts with the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often facing challenges due to disobedience and lack of faith, yet central to God's redemptive plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a></b><br>A mountain range in northern Israel, significant as the site of King Saul's final battle and death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The event where the Philistines defeated the Israelites, leading to the death of King Saul and his sons, marking a pivotal moment in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The defeat at Mount Gilboa serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

The general coincidence of the two texts is so exact as to preclude the supposition of independence. We know that the chronicler has drawn much in his earlier chapters from the Pentateuch; and as he must have been acquainted with the Books of Samuel, it is <span class= "ital">a priori</span> likely that he made a similar use of them. At the same time, a number of small variations--on an average, three at least in each verse--some of which can neither be referred to the freaks or mistakes of copyists nor to the supposed caprice of the compiler, may be taken to indicate the use of an additional source, or perhaps of a text of Samuel differing in some respects from that which we possess.

On the contrary, it is there the natural conclusion of the wars between the Philistines and Saul. This engagement took place (<a href="/1_samuel/28-4.htm">1 Samuel 28:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1, 11</a>) on the plains of Jezreel. The name Jezreel marks either the city (<a href="/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1, 11</a>), or the cele<span class="accented">brated valley or plain</span> called in later times Esdraelon, the Greek form of the word. The plain in its largest proportions may be said to have been bounded by the Mediterranean (although it is called the plain of Accho, where it abuts on that sea) and the Jordan, and by the Samaria and Carmel ranges on the south and south-west, and those of Galilee on the north and northeast. While called a "plain" and "the great plain" in <a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>, its name in the Old Testament is "valley." It lay like a scalene triangle, with its apex in the direction of the Mediterranean, opening into the above-mentioned plain of Accho, and its sides going from right to left, about fifteen, twelve, and eighteen miles long respectively. The allusions to it in Old Testament history are frequent. Its exceeding richness is now turned into desolation unexceeded. Megiddo (<a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>), the city, centre of a smaller valley called by the same name (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-29.htm">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>; <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), was situated within it, in the direction of Carmel. (For very full and interesting account of the Jezreel with which we have here to do, and of Esdraelon, see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 336-356, edit. 1866.) <span class="cmt_word">Mount Gilboa</span> identifies for us the exact battle-field of the text. It is the same with that on which Gideon triumphed (<a href="/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1, 8</a>). It is in the lot of Issachar, flanked by the Little Hermon ridge on the north-east, and by Gilboa on the south-east, a mountain range of ten miles long, about six hundred feet high, and mentioned only in the melancholy connection of this history. The flight of the men of Israel and of Saul was from the plain back to their position on Mount Gilboa, where they were pursued, overtaken, and slain.
