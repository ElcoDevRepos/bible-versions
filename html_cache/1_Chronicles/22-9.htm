The term "man of rest" signifies a ruler who will not be engaged in constant warfare, unlike David, who was a warrior king. The concept of rest is significant in biblical theology, often symbolizing peace and divine favor. Solomon's reign is characterized by peace and prosperity, allowing him to focus on building the temple, a task David could not complete due to his many battles.<p><b>I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side;</b><br>This promise of rest from enemies highlights a period of unprecedented peace for Israel. Historically, Solomon's reign was marked by diplomatic relationships and alliances, reducing the need for military conflict. This peace allowed for economic growth and cultural development. Theologically, this rest can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate peace brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, who offers spiritual rest to believers.<p><b>for his name will be Solomon,</b><br>The name Solomon is derived from the Hebrew word "shalom," meaning peace. This name is prophetic, reflecting the nature of his reign. Solomon's wisdom and peaceful governance are well-documented in the biblical narrative, particularly in the books of Kings and Chronicles. His name itself is a testament to the fulfillment of God's promise to David.<p><b>and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign.</b><br>This assurance of peace and quiet is a divine blessing, allowing Israel to flourish. During Solomon's reign, the nation experienced a golden age, with advancements in architecture, literature, and trade. The peace during Solomon's time is a type of the messianic peace prophesied in the Old Testament, pointing to the future reign of Christ, where ultimate peace and righteousness will prevail. Solomon's temple, built during this time, becomes a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desired to build a temple for the Lord but was told by God that his son would fulfill this task.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David, prophesied to be a "man of rest" and the one who would build the temple, bringing peace and prosperity to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which would experience peace and quiet during Solomon's reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The surrounding nations and adversaries from whom God promised to give rest to Israel during Solomon's reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The holy place that Solomon would build, signifying God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_fulfillment_of_promises.htm">God's Sovereignty in Fulfillment of Promises</a></b><br>God's promise to David about Solomon shows His control over history and His faithfulness in fulfilling His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_peace_for_god's_work.htm">The Importance of Peace for God's Work</a></b><br>Solomon's reign of peace allowed for the construction of the temple, illustrating how peace can facilitate the work of God in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_preparation.htm">Legacy and Preparation</a></b><br>David's preparation for the temple, even though he would not build it, teaches us about the importance of preparing the way for future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_rest_in_christ.htm">Spiritual Rest in Christ</a></b><br>Just as Solomon brought physical rest to Israel, Jesus offers spiritual rest to believers, inviting us to find peace in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Obedience in God's Plan</a></b><br>Solomon's obedience in building the temple highlights the importance of following God's instructions to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_22_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 22:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Chr_22_9_Solomon_s_peace_role.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 22:9 describe Solomon's role in God's plan for peace?

The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant, His power to subdue enemies, and His desire for His people to worship without hindrance&#8212;truths that still encourage believers to trust His promises and pursue His peace today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Shall be born.</span>--<span class= "ital">Is about to be born</span> (participle).<p><span class= "bld">Who shall be.</span>--<span class= "ital">He</span> (emphatic) <span class= "ital">shall become a man of rest,</span> opposed to "a man of war," such as was David (<a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm" title="For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.">2Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>).
