Their duties included guarding the entrances, managing the flow of people, and ensuring that only those who were ceremonially clean could enter. This role reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>, where the priests are instructed to distinguish between the holy and the common. The division of labor among the gatekeepers ensured that the temple functioned smoothly and that worship could proceed without disruption.<p><b>who were descendants of Korah</b><br>The mention of Korah is significant, as Korah was a Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. Despite this, his descendants were not only spared but also given important roles in temple service, demonstrating God's grace and redemption. The Korahites became known for their musical contributions to temple worship, as seen in the Psalms attributed to the sons of Korah (e.g., <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42, 44</a>-49). This transformation from rebellion to service highlights the theme of redemption and the possibility of restoration within God's covenant community.<p><b>and Merari</b><br>Merari was one of the three sons of Levi, the others being Gershon and Kohath. The Merarites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's structural elements, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>. Their inclusion in the divisions of the gatekeepers underscores the comprehensive involvement of the Levites in the service of the temple. This reflects the broader biblical principle of each member of the community having a specific role and function, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where Paul describes the church as the body of Christ, with each part contributing to the whole.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

David.<p>&#8226; God values structure among His people, just as He arranged priestly &#8220;divisions&#8221; earlier (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Such divisions protected worship from chaos, ensuring every duty in the temple was covered at the right time (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that obedience includes honoring God-given organization (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the

paralleled the Levites who cared for the tabernacle entrances in Moses&#8217; day (<a href="/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50&#8211;53</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, believers today are called to

claim the office (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This safeguards purity of worship, prefiguring how Christ&#8217;s priesthood rests on His perfect, God-appointed
