This phrase highlights the Israelites' recognition of their dependence on God for victory. The act of crying out signifies a heartfelt plea for help, often seen in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>). It underscores the belief that God is a present help in times of trouble (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>they were helped against their enemies</b><br>This assistance from God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God often intervenes on behalf of His people when they are faithful. The Israelites' victories were attributed to divine aid rather than military might, as seen in battles like Jericho (Joshua 6). This reflects the covenant relationship where God promises protection in return for obedience and faithfulness.<p><b>and the Hagrites and all their allies were delivered into their hands</b><br>The Hagrites were a nomadic tribe, possibly descendants of Hagar, living east of the Jordan River. Their mention here indicates a historical conflict with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The deliverance of these enemies into the Israelites' hands demonstrates God's sovereignty and fulfillment of His promises to protect and establish Israel in the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p><b>Because they put their trust in God</b><br>Trust in God is a central tenet of faith throughout the Bible. This trust is not merely intellectual assent but involves a deep-seated reliance on God's character and promises. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> emphasizes trusting in the Lord with all one's heart. The Israelites' trust here is a model of faith that leads to divine intervention and victory.<p><b>He answered their prayers</b><br>God's response to prayer is a testament to His faithfulness and attentiveness to His people. The Bible consistently portrays God as one who hears and answers the prayers of the righteous (1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>). This phrase assures believers of the efficacy of prayer and God's willingness to act on behalf of those who earnestly seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These were the tribes of Israel involved in the battle against the Hagrites.
