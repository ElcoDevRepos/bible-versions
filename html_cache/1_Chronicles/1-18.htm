This lineage is significant as it traces the ancestry of the Israelites, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise to Noah to preserve humanity through his family. Arphaxad's name appears in the genealogies of <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a> and <a href="/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10-13</a>, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan through specific family lines. The genealogical records serve to connect the post-flood world to the patriarchs, showing the divine orchestration of history. Arphaxad's role as the father of Shelah is a link in the chain leading to the birth of Abraham, the father of the Israelite nation.<p><b>and Shelah was the father of Eber</b><br>Shelah continues the line from Arphaxad, and his mention in the genealogies underscores the importance of lineage in the biblical narrative. Eber, Shelah's son, is a significant figure as he is traditionally considered the ancestor of the Hebrews. The name "Eber" is etymologically linked to the term "Hebrew," suggesting a connection to the identity of the people who would later become known as the Israelites. This connection is further supported by references in <a href="/genesis/10-24.htm">Genesis 10:24</a> and <a href="/genesis/11-14.htm">Genesis 11:14-17</a>. The genealogical record here serves to establish the roots of the Hebrew people, reinforcing their identity and God's covenantal promises. Eber's place in the genealogy is crucial as it sets the stage for the emergence of the Hebrew nation, through which God's redemptive plan would unfold, ultimately leading to the coming of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of the promises made to the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/arphaxad.htm">Arphaxad</a></b><br>A descendant of Noah, specifically the son of Shem.
