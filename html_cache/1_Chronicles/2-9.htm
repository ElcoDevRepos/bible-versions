He is the grandson of Judah, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and the son of Perez. This lineage is crucial as it establishes the ancestry of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ. The genealogies in Chronicles emphasize the continuity of God's covenant with Israel through the line of Judah, highlighting the importance of family and heritage in biblical history.<p><b>Jerahmeel:</b><br>Jerahmeel is the first son mentioned, and his descendants formed the Jerahmeelites, a clan within the tribe of Judah. This group is mentioned in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>, where David interacts with them. The Jerahmeelites' presence in the narrative underscores the diverse composition of the tribe of Judah and the broader Israelite community.<p><b>Ram:</b><br>Ram is an ancestor of King David, as noted in the genealogies of <a href="/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3-4</a>. His inclusion in the genealogy highlights the messianic line leading to Jesus Christ. The name Ram means "exalted" or "high," which can be seen as a foreshadowing of the exalted status of his descendant, King David, and ultimately, Jesus.<p><b>Caleb:</b><br>Caleb is a notable figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness and courage. He is one of the two spies, along with Joshua, who trusted in God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan (Numbers 13-14). Caleb's faith and leadership are celebrated in the biblical narrative, and his inheritance in the land is detailed in <a href="/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14</a>. His story exemplifies trust in God and the rewards of faithfulness, serving as an inspiration for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezron.htm">Hezron</a></b><br>Hezron is a significant figure in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah.
