The <span class="accented">tau</span> in this word is probably an error for the article. Kennicott ('Dies.,' 72, 82) confirms this supposition by noting that the Book of Samuel constantly replaces by the definite article what appears in Chronicles as "son of." He has also shown reason for believing that the words in this passage, "that sat in the seat, are a corruption of the Hebrew text for characters that would spell our name "Jashobeam." We know nothing of this name "Hachmon," which may be the name of an earlier forefather, while <span class="cmt_word">Zabdiel</span>, thence named "the Hach-monite," appears to Be the name of the actual father of Jashobeam.
