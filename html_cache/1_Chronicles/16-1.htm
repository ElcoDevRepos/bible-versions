It contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna. The Ark's journey to Jerusalem marked a significant moment in Israel's history, as it represented the unification of religious and political life under King David. This event fulfilled David's desire to establish Jerusalem as the spiritual center of Israel, a city chosen by God (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-15</a>).<p><b>and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it.</b><br>David prepared a special tent in Jerusalem to house the Ark, signifying a temporary dwelling until the construction of the Temple by his son Solomon. This act demonstrated David's reverence and commitment to honoring God. The tent, or tabernacle, was reminiscent of the portable sanctuary used during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, emphasizing the continuity of worship practices. David's actions foreshadowed the future establishment of a permanent Temple, a central place of worship for the nation (<a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8:1-11</a>).<p><b>And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.</b><br>Burnt offerings, symbolizing atonement and dedication, were entirely consumed by fire, representing the worshiper's total surrender to God. Peace offerings, on the other hand, were expressions of thanksgiving and fellowship, with portions shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer. These offerings highlighted the communal and covenantal relationship between God and His people. The sacrificial system pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and established a new covenant through His death and resurrection (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who orchestrated the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.

So ch. 15:1 distinctly states that David had "pitched a tent" for the ark, and evidently to be ready for its arrival. On the other hand, there is no mention of any such tent having been got in readiness in ch. 13. or in <a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-11</a>, which give the account of the attempt that disastrously failed. The expressions which are there used would rather lead to the conclusion that David's intention was to take the sacred structure into his own home (<a href="/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-12.htm">1 Chronicles 13:12, 13</a>), for a while, at all events.
