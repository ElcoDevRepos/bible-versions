Their gathering at Hebron signifies a unified recognition of David's leadership. Hebron, located in the Judean hills, is a city of great historical and spiritual significance. It was previously the home of Abraham and the burial site of the patriarchs, adding weight to the events taking place there. This meeting at Hebron marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as it transitions from a divided nation under Saul to a united kingdom under David.<p><b>where David made a covenant with them before the LORD</b><br>The covenant made by David with the elders is a formal agreement, signifying mutual commitments and responsibilities. This covenant is made "before the LORD," indicating that it is not merely a political agreement but a sacred vow with divine witness. Covenants in the biblical context often involve promises and obligations, reflecting the seriousness of the commitment. This act echoes earlier covenants in the Bible, such as those made with Noah, Abraham, and Moses, and underscores the theological foundation of David's kingship.<p><b>And they anointed him king over Israel</b><br>Anointing is a significant ritual in the Bible, symbolizing the consecration and divine approval of a person for a specific role. The anointing of David as king over Israel marks the official recognition of his God-given authority. This act fulfills the earlier anointing by Samuel, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, where David was chosen by God to be king. Anointing with oil is also a type of Christ, as the term "Messiah" means "Anointed One," pointing to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the anointed king.<p><b>according to the word of the LORD through Samuel</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's promise and prophetic word delivered through Samuel. Samuel, as a prophet, played a crucial role in God's plan for Israel, first anointing Saul and then David. The reference to the "word of the LORD" emphasizes the divine orchestration of events and the reliability of God's promises. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of prophecy and fulfillment, demonstrating God's sovereignty and faithfulness in guiding the history of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is anointed as king over Israel.

This third time when David was anointed king over the united people, it was at all events at the special instance of "all the elders of Israel," although who officiated on these two last occasions is not mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord by Samuel</span>.
