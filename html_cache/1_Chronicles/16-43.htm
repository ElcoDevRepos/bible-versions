The people had gathered to celebrate this momentous occasion with sacrifices, music, and feasting. The departure of the people signifies the end of the communal worship and celebration. This reflects the pattern of worship in Israel, where the community gathers for significant religious events and then returns to their daily lives, carrying the spiritual impact with them. It echoes the rhythm of life in ancient Israel, where worship was both a communal and personal experience.<p><b>and David returned home</b><br>David's return home signifies his role not only as king but also as a family man. Despite his public duties and the grandeur of the event, David's return to his household highlights the importance of family and personal life. This balance between public service and private devotion is a recurring theme in David's life. It also reflects the biblical principle that leadership begins at home, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>, where leaders are encouraged to manage their households well.<p><b>to bless his household</b><br>David's intention to bless his household indicates his role as a spiritual leader within his family. In the context of ancient Israel, the head of the household was responsible for the spiritual well-being of the family. This act of blessing can be seen as a type of priestly function, foreshadowing the role of Christ as the head of the Church, who blesses His people. The blessing of the household also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's covenant blessings being passed down through families, as seen in the promises to Abraham and his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who led the people in worship and thanksgiving to God.

The offerings have been presented, the psalm of thanksgiving has been sung, and the Levites have been appointed to minister continually before the LORD. By using &#8220;then,&#8221; the writer signals that what follows is the natural, orderly conclusion of worship&#8212;life continues with God&#8217;s blessing in view (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the people departed for their homes</b><p>&#8226; The worshipers do not linger at the tabernacle but return to their normal routines, carrying the memory of God&#8217;s presence with them. This mirrors the pattern seen after covenant ceremonies when Moses &#8220;sent the people away&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-23.htm">Exodus 18:23</a>) and after temple dedications when Solomon dismissed the assembly &#8220;to their homes joyful and glad of heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>).<p>&#8226; Corporate worship fuels personal obedience. Having celebrated together, the nation is now equipped to honor God in daily life (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and David returned home</b><p>&#8226; Even as king, David models submission to the same rhythm as his subjects&#8212;public worship followed by private faithfulness. His leadership is humble and personal, reflecting the shepherd heart God commended (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s return echoes Deuteronomy&#8217;s instruction that leaders not exalt themselves above their brothers (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>). The king stands with, not above, the people before God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bless his household</b><p>&#8226; Blessing is not a perfunctory farewell; it is an intentional act of speaking God&#8217;s favor. Like Abraham who commanded his household to keep the way of the LORD (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>), David ensures that the grace experienced in public reaches the most intimate circle of influence&#8212;his family (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The order matters: God&#8217;s blessing flows from the throne (the ark) to the congregation, then into every home, beginning with the leader&#8217;s own. David&#8217;s practice sets a precedent later echoed by Joshua&#8217;s resolve, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By blessing rather than merely ruling his household, David anticipates the Messiah&#8217;s servant-king character, who &#8220;came not to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/16-43.htm">1 Chronicles 16:43</a> closes the ark&#8217;s enthronement celebration with a picture of worship that overflows into everyday life. Corporate joy gives way to personal responsibility: the people go home fortified by God&#8217;s presence, and David leads by ensuring that his own family experiences the same covenant blessing. True worship gathers the community, renews the heart, and then radiates outward&#8212;first to our households, and ultimately to the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) This verse is a duplicate of <a href="/context/2_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
