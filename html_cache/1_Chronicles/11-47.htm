The name Eliel means "My God is God," reflecting a strong theistic belief that was central to the identity of the Israelites. This name is significant in the context of David's reign, as it underscores the importance of faith and divine support in the success of his kingdom. Eliel's inclusion in this list highlights the diverse backgrounds of David's warriors, who came together for a common purpose under God's anointed king.<p><b>Obed</b><br>Obed is another of David's mighty men, and his name means "servant" or "worshiper." This reflects the cultural and religious emphasis on servitude to God and the king, which was a key aspect of Israelite society. Obed's role as a warrior in David's army suggests a life dedicated to service and loyalty, both to God and to the anointed king. The name Obed also connects to other biblical figures, such as Obed the father of Jesse, who was David's grandfather, indicating a possible familial or symbolic link to the Davidic line.<p><b>Jaasiel the Mezobaite</b><br>Jaasiel is identified as "the Mezobaite," which likely refers to his place of origin or a specific clan affiliation. The name Jaasiel means "God is my maker," emphasizing a personal relationship with God as creator and sustainer. This reflects the theological understanding of God as intimately involved in the lives of His people. The designation "Mezobaite" is less clear, but it may indicate a geographical location or a tribal association, suggesting that David's warriors were drawn from various regions and backgrounds. This diversity within the ranks of David's mighty men illustrates the unifying power of David's leadership and God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliel.htm">Eliel</a></b><br>A warrior listed among David's mighty men.

The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God knows each faithful servant by name&#8212;Eliel&#8217;s single appearance in Scripture still matters eternally (cf. <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; His inclusion signals proven courage. Earlier verses describe exploits of the Thirty (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10&#8211;41</a>), and <a href="/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24&#8211;39</a> parallels the roster. Eliel stood shoulder to shoulder with legends like Benaiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22&#8211;25</a>), showing that steadfast loyalty, not fame, secures a place in God&#8217;s record.<p>&#8226; The text affirms historical reliability; a proper name without embellishment underscores that this is factual bookkeeping, not folklore (compare the meticulous genealogies in <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/1.htm">1 Chronicles 1&#8211;9</a>).<p>Application: ordinary believers can rest in the truth that the Lord sees every act of faithfulness (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>) and preserves it in His memory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Obed</b><p>Obed immediately follows Eliel, spotlighting another warrior whose deeds supported David&#8217;s God-ordained kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a> - 13).<p>&#8226; Obed&#8217;s name (&#8220;servant&#8221;) echoes the servant-heart God desires (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). In 1 Chronicles, servants who step forward at critical moments advance God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;consider the Levites who carried the ark (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 14</a>).<p>&#8226; Obed likely served in the same elite corps as Uriah the Hittite (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41</a>), reminding us that unity in mission overcomes ethnic and social differences (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing of Eliel and Obed shows successive generations of warriors; the Chronicler often highlights continuity of faith (e.g., the sons of Korah in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31-38</a>).<p>Application: titles and positions fade, but willingness to serve the anointed King leaves an indelible mark (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jaasiel the Mezobaite</b><p>The final name, &#8220;Jaasiel the Mezobaite,&#8221; identifies both the man and his hometown.<p>&#8226; Geography matters to God. By recording Mezoba, Scripture roots Jaasiel in real soil, just as Jesus was rooted in Nazareth (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Ending the roster with Jaasiel underscores the breadth of David&#8217;s support base&#8212;from the heartland of Judah (v. 10) out to lesser-known Mezoba (cf. the varied tribes in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23-40</a>).<p>&#8226; His name (&#8220;God has made&#8221;) testifies that each warrior was God-fashioned for that moment (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The Chronicler&#8217;s goal is encouragement: if God could raise up Jaasiel from an obscure place, He can raise up any believer today for kingdom work (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>).<p>Application: no location is too remote for God&#8217;s call; availability outweighs visibility (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a> - 3).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/11-47.htm">1 Chronicles 11:47</a> may read like a simple closing line&#8212;&#8220;Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.&#8221;&#8212;yet it proclaims that God records individual faithfulness, esteems servant-hearted courage, and calls people from every corner to advance His righteous rule. Each name invites us to stand ready, confident that the Lord who noticed these three unnoticed heroes still sees, remembers, and rewards all who faithfully serve His King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">Eliel.</span>-LXX., "Daliel."<p><span class= "bld">The Mesobaite.</span>--The word is corrupt.
