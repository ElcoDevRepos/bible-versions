The mention of "gold lampstands and their lamps" highlights the importance of light in the temple, symbolizing God's presence and guidance. Gold, a precious metal, signifies purity and divinity, often associated with God's holiness. The lampstands are reminiscent of the menorah in the Tabernacle, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>, which served as a perpetual light. This connection underscores continuity between the Tabernacle and the Temple, emphasizing the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps</b><br>The specific mention of "the weight of each lampstand and its lamps" indicates meticulous attention to detail in the temple's construction, reflecting the order and precision that God desires in worship. This precision can be seen as a reflection of God's character, who is a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). The detailed instructions also ensure that the temple's furnishings are made according to divine specifications, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>). This attention to detail can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets with precision (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps</b><br>Silver, often associated with redemption and atonement, is used here for the lampstands, suggesting a connection to the sacrificial system and the need for purification. The use of silver alongside gold in the temple's construction may symbolize the dual aspects of God's nature: His holiness (gold) and His redemptive work (silver). The specific mention of the weight of each silver lampstand underscores the importance of balance and proportion in worship, reflecting the need for both reverence and redemption in approaching God.<p><b>according to the use of each lampstand</b><br>This phrase indicates that each lampstand had a specific function or placement within the temple, suggesting an organized and purposeful design. The use of each lampstand would have been determined by its location and role in the temple service, reflecting the structured nature of worship in ancient Israel. This organization can be seen as a reflection of the body of Christ, where each member has a specific role and function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). The careful planning and allocation of resources for each lampstand highlight the importance of intentionality in worship and service to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is giving instructions for the building of the temple.

Gold signals supreme value and purity, echoing the single golden menorah of <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31&#8211;40</a>. That earlier lampstand &#8220;was made of one talent of pure gold&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/37-24.htm">Exodus 37:24</a>), and Solomon&#8217;s temple will multiply that original pattern several times over (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-7.htm">2 Chronicles 4:7</a>). By repeating the precious metal, the text underlines the unbroken continuity between the tabernacle and the temple: the same holy light, the same holy presence, now amplified for a larger nation.<p>&#8226; Gold lampstands illuminate the sanctuary, pointing to God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Their weight shows that real, costly material is set apart exclusively for worship, fulfilling David&#8217;s vow in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-3.htm">1 Chronicles 29:3</a> to give &#8220;gold for the gold work.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps</b><p>The verse next stresses individual weights. Every single lampstand is measured, not merely the combined total. That precision mirrors the charge given to Moses: &#8220;See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>). David passes a Spirit-inspired plan to Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11&#8211;13</a>), so the king who builds may not improvise.<p>&#8226; Specific weights prevent shortcuts or inflated pride; Solomon will know exactly how much gold belongs in God&#8217;s house and how much belongs in his own treasury (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Individual accounting also illustrates personal responsibility in worship (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). Each item must be right before the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps</b><p>Silver pieces appear alongside gold ones, showing that diverse materials can serve together in God&#8217;s sanctuary. In <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> David lists &#8220;silver for the silver,&#8221; matching today&#8217;s verse. The combination recalls <a href="/bsb/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>, where tribal leaders bring silver bowls and basins to the tabernacle.<p>&#8226; Silver, though less costly than gold, is still precious and specifically weighed, teaching that all levels of offering matter (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41&#8211;44</a>).<p>&#8226; Having both metals provides flexibility: gold lampstands shine in the Holy Place, while their silver counterparts may serve in adjoining chambers (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the use of each lampstand</b><p>Function determines form. Every lampstand has a placement and a purpose, and its weight is tied to that role. <a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20&#8211;21</a> orders the priests to keep the lamps burning &#8220;from evening till morning,&#8221; and the temple system follows the same rhythm. By tailoring weight to use, the design prevents waste and ensures steady light for daily ministry.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s worship is orderly: &#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase safeguards against repurposing sacred objects for common tasks (<a href="/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/28-15.htm">1 Chronicles 28:15</a> highlights God&#8217;s detailed plan for His dwelling: gold and silver lampstands, each precisely weighed, each assigned a specific task. The verse teaches that the Lord values excellence, accountability, and purposeful design in worship. Nothing is random; everything, from the heaviest gold lampstand to the lightest silver one, is measured out to reflect His holiness and to keep His light shining among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and a</span> (specified) <span class= "ital">weight for the golden lampstands, and their golden lamps, in the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; and</span> (a weight) <span class= "ital">for the lampstands of silver by weight, for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand.</span> The meaning still is that David gave Solomon a description of the designated articles, fixing the proper weight for each.
