This practice, while culturally accepted, often led to familial strife, as seen in the accounts of David's family.<p><b>Ibhar</b><br>Ibhar is one of David's lesser-known sons, and little is mentioned about him elsewhere in the Bible. His name means "He chooses" or "He selects," which may reflect a divine aspect of being chosen or set apart. The lack of additional information about Ibhar suggests that he did not play a significant role in the biblical narrative or in the political landscape of Israel.<p><b>Elishua</b><br>Elishua, also known as Elishama in some biblical texts, means "God is salvation." This name reflects a common theme in Hebrew names, emphasizing reliance on God for deliverance and protection. The name Elishua is not unique to David's son, as it appears in other genealogies, indicating its popularity and the cultural importance of invoking God's name in personal identity.<p><b>Eliphelet</b><br>Eliphelet, meaning "God is deliverance," is another son of David. The repetition of themes of salvation and deliverance in the names of David's sons underscores the theological emphasis on God's role as a savior and protector of Israel. Eliphelet is mentioned again in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-5.htm">1 Chronicles 14:5</a>, but like Ibhar and Elishua, he does not have a prominent role in the biblical narrative. The presence of these names in David's lineage highlights the hope and expectation of divine intervention and blessing upon the house of David, which is ultimately fulfilled in the messianic prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, a descendant of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nogah.htm">Nogah</a></b><br>Nogah is one of the sons of King David, mentioned in the genealogical records of 1 Chronicles. His name means "brightness" or "splendor" in Hebrew, though little else is known about him from the biblical text.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nepheg.htm">Nepheg</a></b><br>Nepheg is another son of David. His name means "sprout" or "shoot" in Hebrew. Like Nogah, there is limited information about his life or role in the biblical account.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/japhia.htm">Japhia</a></b><br>Japhia is also listed as a son of David. His name means "shining" or "enlightened" in Hebrew. The lack of additional context about Japhia in the Bible suggests that his significance lies primarily in his inclusion in the royal lineage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_genealogy_in_scripture.htm">The Importance of Genealogy in Scripture</a></b><br>Genealogies in the Bible, such as the one in <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/3.htm">1 Chronicles 3</a>, underscore the continuity of God's covenant promises.

By saying &#8220;David&#8217;s other sons,&#8221; the Spirit reminds us that the covenant king had many children, not merely the well-known Solomon. This fulfills God&#8217;s promise that David&#8217;s house would be multiplied and established (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>). The phrase also shows that Scripture values every branch of the royal tree, ensuring no link is lost when tracing the Messiah&#8217;s legal ancestry (<a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a>; <a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shifts focus from ruling heirs to lesser-known sons, underscoring God&#8217;s inclusive record-keeping.<p>&#8226; It assures us that even the seemingly obscure are seen and recorded by the Lord (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were Ibhar</b><p>Ibhar&#8217;s name surfaces only in the genealogies (also <a href="/2_samuel/5-15.htm">2 Samuel 5:15</a>), yet that single mention roots him firmly in history. The chronicler&#8217;s detail declares that every child in David&#8217;s household carried covenant significance, even if Scripture never relates their life stories.<p>&#8226; Just as God numbered David&#8217;s sons, He numbers the hairs of our heads (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Though nothing else is written of Ibhar, his existence testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness in enlarging David&#8217;s family line (<a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> applied through David).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elishua</b><p>Elishua (rendered &#8220;Elishama&#8221; in some related passages such as <a href="/2_samuel/5-15.htm">2 Samuel 5:15</a>) reminds us that the Lord cares about accuracy even in variant spellings. The chronicler, guided by the Spirit, lists him here so no generation is forgotten.<p>&#8226; His inclusion reaffirms that &#8220;children are a heritage from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The appearance of his name both here and in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-5.htm">1 Chronicles 14:5</a> anchors the record, proving Scripture&#8217;s careful consistency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eliphelet</b><p>Eliphelet is actually listed twice in this chapter&#8212;once here (v. 6) and again in verse 8&#8212;suggesting either two sons bearing the same name or one who died young and whose name was reused, a common ancient practice. Whichever the case, the chronicler ensures the count of David&#8217;s sons matches historical reality (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-16.htm">2 Samuel 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition drives home that God&#8217;s promises to David were abundant, not minimal (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a> applied through covenant blessings).<p>&#8226; Even an apparently redundant name serves to highlight the precision of the divine record (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> simply lists &#8220;Ibhar, Elishua, Eliphelet,&#8221; yet the verse is loaded with purpose.

By preserving these three names, Scripture underscores God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness&#8212;every promise to David came to pass, every son was counted, and every detail contributes to the unfolding story of redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Ibhar.</span>--"He" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> God) "chooseth."<p><span class= "bld">Elishama.</span>--Spelt Elishua in both of the parallel passsages.
