This ongoing conflict highlights the spiritual battles believers face. The Philistines inhabited the coastal region of Canaan, and their clashes with Israel are documented throughout the Old Testament, notably in the books of Samuel and Kings.<p><b>and Elhanan son of Jair</b><br>Elhanan is a lesser-known figure in the Bible, but his mention here signifies the role of various individuals in God's plan.

Jair, his father, is not widely mentioned, suggesting that God can use anyone, regardless of their background, to achieve His purposes.<p><b>killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite</b><br>Lahmi is identified as the brother of Goliath, the giant slain by David. This connection to Goliath underscores the ongoing struggle against formidable foes. Goliath's defeat by David is a well-known story of faith and divine intervention, and Lahmi's death continues the theme of God's deliverance. The term "Gittite" indicates that they were from Gath, one of the five Philistine cities.<p><b>the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam</b><br>This description emphasizes the formidable nature of Lahmi, similar to Goliath, whose weaponry was also described in great detail. A weaver's beam was a large, heavy piece of equipment, indicating the size and strength of the spear.

Scripture presents these wars as:<p>&#8226; A test of Israel&#8217;s trust in the Lord (<a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; A stage on which God shows His faithfulness in every generation (<a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>The phrase &#8220;once again&#8221; signals that God&#8217;s people must stay spiritually vigilant; past victories do not eliminate future challenges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi</b><p>Elhanan appears among David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a>), demonstrating that courageous warriors existed beyond David himself.

The proper name is probably a transcriber's repetition; the Syriac and Arabic there are without it.<p><span class= "bld">Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite.</span>--The Hebrew text and LXX. of Samuel have the very different statement: "And Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite slew Goliath the Gittite." There are good critics who maintain that we must recognise here a proof that popular traditions fluctuated between David and the less famous hero Elhanan as slayer of Goliath: an uncertainty, supposed to be faithfully reflected in the two accounts preserved by the compiler of Samuel (1 Samuel 17; <a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm" title="And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.">2Samuel 21:19</a>). Other not less competent scholars believe that the text of Samuel should be corrected from the Chronicles. As regards the name Jaare-oregim (<span class= "ital">forests of weavers--</span>an absurdity), this is plausible. Whether we proceed further in the same direction must depend on the general view we take of the chronicler's relation to the Books of Samuel. It is easy, but hardly satisfactory, to allege that he felt the difficulty, which every modern reader must feel, and altered the text accordingly. The real question is whether he has done this arbitrarily, or upon the evidence of another document than his MS. of Samuel. Now, it is fair to say that (1) hitherto we have observed no signs of arbitrary alteration; (2) we have had abundant proof that the chronicler actually possessed other sources besides Samuel. There is no apparent reason why "Lahmi" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Lahmijah) should not be a <span class= "ital">nomen individui.</span> (Comp. Assyrian <span class= "ital">Lahm-,</span> the name of a god, Tablet I., Creation Series.) It is, however, quite possible that Elhanan is another, and, in fact, the original name of <span class= "ital">David.</span> The appellative David. "the beloved" (comp. Dido), may have gradually supplanted the old Elhanan in the popular memory. Solomon we know was at first named Jodidiah, and it is highly probable that the true designation of the first king of Israel has been lost, the name <span class= "ital">Saul</span> ("the asked") having been given in allusion to the fact that the people had <span class= "ital">ashed</span> for a king. We may compare, besides, the double names Jehoahaz-Shallum, Mattaniah-Zedekiah, and perhaps Uzziah-Azariah. The Targum on Samuel partly supports this suggestion (see the Note there). I would add that <span class= "ital">Jaare</span> in Hebrew writing is an easy corruption of <span class= "ital">Jesse;</span> so that the original reading of <a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm" title="And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.">2Samuel 21:19</a> may have been, "And Elhanan the son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, slew Goliath," &c. In that case, the reading of Chronicles must be considered an unsuccessful emendation, due probably to the compiler whose work the chronicler followed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elhanan the son of Jair</span>. In Samuel Jair appears as <span class="accented">Jaare.</span> This Elhanan is probably different from him of <a href="/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26</a>. There is a strange confusion in the reading of this and its parallel verse. If our present verse is to stand corrected by accepting from its parallel "the Bethlehemite" in place of our <span class="accented">Lamhi</span>, then either we have no name given for the brother of Goliath, the Gittite; or, if we drop the word "brother" (changing the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> of Chronicles into the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> of Samuel), and make Goliath the Gittite the man slain by Elhanan, then of such a Goliath we know nothing, and it is a most unlikely coincidence of name with the conquered of David's sling.. Kennicott's seventy-eighth dissertation is occupied, and ably, with the <span class="accented">pros</span> and <span class="accented">cons</span> of this question; and the curiosities of Jerome on the passage may be found in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae.' There seems no sufficient reason to depart from our reading here, to which it were preferable to adjust the reading in the parallel place, which exhibits almost certainly a glaring corruption of text in another respect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Once again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
