This reaction can be understood in the context of his deep desire to honor God by bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. His anger may have been directed at himself for not following the prescribed method of transporting the Ark, as outlined in the Law of Moses (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). It also highlights the human tendency to react emotionally when faced with unexpected divine actions.<p><b>because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah.</b><br>The phrase "burst forth" indicates a sudden and powerful action by God, reminiscent of the earlier event at Baal-perazim (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-11.htm">1 Chronicles 14:11</a>), where God "burst" through David's enemies. Uzzah's death was a direct result of touching the Ark, which was forbidden (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). This incident underscores the holiness of God and the importance of obedience to His commands. It serves as a reminder of the reverence required in handling sacred objects and the seriousness of God's instructions.<p><b>So he named that place Perez-uzzah,</b><br>The naming of the place Perez-uzzah, meaning "outburst against Uzzah," serves as a memorial to the event. Naming locations after significant events was a common practice in biblical times, serving both as a historical record and a theological lesson. This name would remind future generations of the consequences of disobedience and the holiness of God.<p><b>as it is called to this day.</b><br>The phrase "as it is called to this day" suggests that the account was written at a time when the name was still in use, indicating the lasting impact of the event on the collective memory of Israel. It emphasizes the enduring nature of God's actions and the lessons they impart. This phrase also connects the narrative to the broader historical context, showing the continuity of tradition and the importance of remembering God's dealings with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
