Genealogies were crucial for establishing tribal identities, inheritance rights, and priestly duties. They served as a means to preserve the history and lineage of the people, ensuring that the promises made to the patriarchs were remembered and fulfilled. The recording of genealogies also reflects the meticulous nature of the chronicler, who sought to provide an accurate account of Israel's history. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5 and 10</a>, and in the New Testament, where the genealogies of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> establish His rightful place in the line of David.<p><b>during the reigns of Jotham king of Judah</b><br>Jotham was the son of Uzziah and reigned as king of Judah from approximately 750 to 735 BC. His reign is noted for his construction projects and military successes, as well as his efforts to maintain the worship of Yahweh, despite the people's continued idolatry. Jotham's reign is described in <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32-38</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27</a>. His time as king was marked by relative stability and prosperity, which may have facilitated the recording of genealogies. Jotham's faithfulness to God is contrasted with the idolatry of the northern kingdom, highlighting the divided nature of Israel during this period.<p><b>and Jeroboam king of Israel</b><br>This refers to Jeroboam II, who reigned over the northern kingdom of Israel from approximately 793 to 753 BC. His reign was characterized by economic prosperity and territorial expansion, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>. Despite these successes, Jeroboam II continued the idolatrous practices initiated by the first Jeroboam, leading to spiritual decline. The mention of Jeroboam alongside Jotham underscores the divided monarchy, with Israel and Judah following different paths both politically and spiritually. The prophets Amos and Hosea ministered during Jeroboam II's reign, calling for repentance and warning of impending judgment due to Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>king of Israel</b><br>The title "king of Israel" during this period refers to the ruler of the northern kingdom, distinct from the southern kingdom of Judah. The division of the united monarchy occurred after Solomon's reign, leading to separate lines of kings for Israel and Judah. This division is a significant theme in the historical books, illustrating the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant. The northern kingdom, often plagued by idolatry and political instability, eventually fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC. The chronicler's inclusion of both kings in this verse serves to provide a historical context for the genealogical records, emphasizing the continuity of God's people despite political fragmentation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham,_king_of_judah.htm">Jotham, King of Judah</a></b><br>Jotham was the son of Uzziah and reigned as king of Judah.

This quite tallies with the fact that there were two <span class="accented">chronicles</span>, one for each division of the nation, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the chronicles of the kings of Judah" (<a href="/2_kings/15-6.htm">2 Kings 15:6</a>) and "the chronicles of the kings of Israel" (<a href="/2_kings/15-11.htm">2 Kings 15:11</a>), in which same chapter both Jeroboam (II.) of Israel and Jotham of Judah are spoken of, the latter beginning to reign in Judah some twenty years (the exact chronology is very confused here) after the death of the former. Although presumably it would be an object of closer interest with Israel than with Judah to effect the registration of the Gadite genealogy, yet it was most just that Judah should do so as well. This would both vindicate Judah's own right place and be a happy omen of the continued predominance of her position compared with that of Israel. Independently of the question of <span class="accented">effecting</span> the actual registration, however, it is quite possible that, so long as history ran by the side of history. Israel would gather and keep all it could of Judah, and Judah all it could of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All of them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(kul&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
