The concept of being "foreigners and strangers" is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the temporary and pilgrim status of God's people on earth. In <a href="/genesis/23-4.htm">Genesis 23:4</a>, Abraham describes himself as a foreigner and stranger among the Hittites, highlighting his reliance on God's promises rather than earthly possessions. The New Testament echoes this in <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>, where the faithful are described as strangers and exiles on the earth, seeking a heavenly homeland. This phrase underscores the humility and dependence on God that believers are called to embody.<p><b>as were all our forefathers</b><br>This part of the verse connects the current generation with their ancestors, acknowledging a shared experience of transience and reliance on God. The forefathers, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, lived as nomads, often without a permanent home, which is a physical representation of their spiritual journey. This continuity emphasizes the faithfulness of God across generations and the enduring nature of His covenant. It also serves as a reminder of the collective identity of God's people, rooted in a history of faith and obedience.<p><b>Our days on earth are like a shadow</b><br>The imagery of life as a shadow conveys the brevity and insubstantial nature of human existence. Shadows are fleeting and lack substance, illustrating how life on earth is temporary and quickly passing. This metaphor is found in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>, which also speak to the ephemeral nature of life. The use of this imagery encourages believers to focus on eternal realities rather than temporal concerns, aligning with the wisdom literature's emphasis on the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>without hope</b><br>In this context, "without hope" does not imply despair but rather highlights the futility of placing hope in earthly things. The hope of believers is not rooted in the transient world but in the eternal promises of God. This aligns with the message of Ecclesiastes, where earthly pursuits are deemed meaningless without a relationship with God. The New Testament reinforces this by presenting Jesus Christ as the living hope (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>), offering eternal life and redemption. This phrase serves as a call to place trust and hope in God's eternal plan rather than in the fleeting nature of earthly life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, King David, is addressing God in a prayer of thanksgiving as he prepares for the construction of the temple, which his son Solomon will build.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, whom David refers to as "foreigners and sojourners," acknowledging their transient existence on earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_preparation.htm">Temple Preparation</a></b><br>This verse is part of a larger context where David is gathering resources and making preparations for the building of the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is to be built, representing the spiritual and political center of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>David's son, who is chosen to build the temple, continuing the legacy and covenant promises given to David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_transience.htm">Understanding Our Transience</a></b><br>Recognize that our time on earth is temporary and fleeting, much like a shadow.
