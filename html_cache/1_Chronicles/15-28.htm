Its movement to Jerusalem signified the centralization of worship and the unification of the nation under King David. The phrase "all Israel" emphasizes the collective participation and unity of the tribes, highlighting the importance of the event. This moment reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to establish a place for His name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>) and prefigures the coming of Christ, who unites all believers.<p><b>with shouting</b><br>Shouting was a common expression of joy and triumph in ancient Israel, often associated with victory in battle or significant religious events (<a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/47.htm">Psalm 47:1</a>). This joyful noise symbolizes the people's reverence and excitement for the presence of God among them.

Their use here underscores the ark's significance and the divine presence it represents. The sound of the trumpet is also associated with the return of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p><b>and with cymbals and the music of harps and lyres</b><br>Cymbals, harps, and lyres were integral to Israelite worship, often accompanying psalms and songs of praise (<a href="/psalms/150-3.htm">Psalm 150:3-5</a>). These instruments reflect the rich musical tradition of the Israelites and their dedication to worshiping God with all available resources. The use of music in worship is a theme that continues into the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to sing and make music in their hearts to the Lord (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the twelve tribes descended from Jacob.
