David is speaking to the leaders and people of Israel, underscoring the communal aspect of their covenant relationship with God. The "assembly of the LORD" refers to the gathered people of Israel, who are often called to witness significant events and covenants (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>). This public declaration reinforces accountability and unity among the people.<p><b>and in the hearing of our God</b><br>This highlights the divine witness to the proceedings. It serves as a reminder that God is present and attentive to the commitments being made. This concept is echoed in other scriptures where God is portrayed as a witness to covenants and oaths (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>). It underscores the seriousness of the moment and the divine expectation for faithfulness.<p><b>keep and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God</b><br>The call to "keep" and "seek out" the commandments emphasizes both obedience and diligent study. "Keep" implies adherence and practice, while "seek out" suggests a proactive pursuit of understanding God's laws. This dual approach is foundational in the Torah, where the law is given as a guide for righteous living (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>). It reflects the importance of both knowing and doing God's will.<p><b>so that you may possess this good land</b><br>The promise of land possession is a central theme in the Old Testament, tied to the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The "good land" refers to Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, symbolizing God's provision and blessing. Possession of the land is contingent upon obedience to God's commandments, a recurring theme in the Deuteronomic history (<a href="/deuteronomy/8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:1</a>).<p><b>and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever</b><br>This phrase underscores the generational aspect of God's promises. The land is not only for the current generation but is to be preserved for future descendants. This reflects the biblical principle of legacy and stewardship, where the faithfulness of one generation impacts the next (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>). The concept of an eternal inheritance also foreshadows the New Testament promise of an eternal inheritance through Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, King David, is addressing the leaders of Israel.

I adjure you. David ends his address to the people by a solemn appeal, like that, of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deuteronomy 30:19</a> : "I call heaven and earth to witness," &c.). David's appeal is to the whole nation as represented before him, and to the God whose ear is ever open.<p><span class= "bld">Seek</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> do not neglect; resort to them always as the rule of right living (same word as <a href="/1_chronicles/13-3.htm" title="And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.">1Chronicles 13:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm" title="For because you did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach on us, for that we sought him not after the due order.">1Chronicles 15:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That ye may possess this</span> (Heb. <span class= "ital">the</span>) <span class= "bld">good land.</span>--Another reminiscence of Deuteronomy (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-1.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Pharez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and Shobal.">1Chronicles 4:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-21.htm" title="The sons of Shelah the son of Judah were, Er the father of Lecah, and Laadah the father of Mareshah, and the families of the house of them that worked fine linen, of the house of Ashbea,">1Chronicles 4:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - The double charge of these verses, first to the people and then to Solomon, is full of force and majesty.

The. expression, <span class="cmt_word">Know thou the God of thy father</span>, for a practical knowledge and fear of God, is analogous with the expression, "Hear thou," for the matter of practical <span class="accented">obedience</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "If they <span class="accented">hear</span> not Moses and the prophets" (Luke 16:32). Although there are not very many instances of this use of the word "know," its antiquity and classical character may be considered guaranteed by such passages as <a href="/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. The expression, "the God of thy father," evidently intended to be touching, is more fully given in ver. 20, "God, even my God, will be with thee," which in its turn reminds us of Paul's language, "But my God shall supply all your need" (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The urgent entreaty on the part of David breathes in every sentence of it, thought, and a mode of presentation of it, feeling, and depth of conviction, with which we are familiar in his psalms. He speaks from his own varied, remarkable, and rich experience of the Divine care and jealous love, and from much personal experience of the deceitfulness of the heart, to Solomon, into whom, were it possible, he would pour the advantage of all he had learned, and from whom he would hide nothing of his intense and anxious solicitude. To the same strain he returns in ver. 20, but there with more exclusive reference to the undertaking of the building of "the house of the Lord," or the <span class="cmt_word">house for the sanctuary</span>. One thing only fails, perhaps, to be made quite apparent from the language of David, viz. why he deemed it necessary to urge so strenuously on Solomon the enterprise of building the temple and of carrying it to completion. With abundance of means and preparations so large already made, one might have supposed a young king and a young man would have needed little pressure and little exhortation. Nevertheless, in the manifest presence of David's words, it is very far from impossible to suppose the dangers and temptations of Solomon's position as constituting a serious risk. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/28-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
