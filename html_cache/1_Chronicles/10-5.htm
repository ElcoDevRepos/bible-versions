This position required loyalty and bravery. The armor-bearer&#8217;s actions reflect the deep bond and duty to his master, King Saul. The death of Saul, Israel's first king, marked a significant turning point in Israelite history, leading to David's rise to power. Saul's death was a fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>) and a consequence of his disobedience to God. The armor-bearer's reaction indicates the gravity of the situation and the despair felt by those loyal to Saul.<p><b>he too fell on his own sword and died</b><br>The act of falling on one's sword was a method of suicide in ancient times, often seen as a way to avoid capture or disgrace. This action by the armor-bearer signifies his loyalty to Saul, choosing death over living without his king. It also reflects the cultural values of honor and loyalty prevalent in the ancient Near East. The armor-bearer's death parallels Saul's own suicide, highlighting the tragic end of Saul's reign. This event underscores the theme of divine judgment and the consequences of turning away from God's commands, as seen throughout the narrative of Saul's kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

He witnesses Saul&#8217;s final, desperate act (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>). A few quick observations help us feel the weight of that moment:<p>&#8226; An armor-bearer&#8217;s duty was to protect and obey his king (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-7</a>). What he sees is the collapse of every earthly security he has.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;seeing&#8221; is not rumor but certain knowledge, matching the inspired record&#8217;s emphasis on eyewitness fact (<a href="/1_samuel/31-5.htm">1 Samuel 31:5</a>; <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Bible repeatedly highlights how witnessing a leader&#8217;s downfall can shake followers to the core (<a href="/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Saul was dead</b><p>The statement is stark and final&#8212;exactly what Samuel foretold: &#8220;Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>). By the time the armor-bearer looks, God&#8217;s judgment is complete:<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s life ends because of unfaithfulness to the LORD (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; His death also signals the end of a dynasty, clearing the way for David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records no hint of repentance in Saul&#8217;s last minutes&#8212;only fear (<a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he too fell on his own sword</b><p>Out of options, the armor-bearer chooses suicide, echoing his master&#8217;s action:<p>&#8226; The same wording appears in the parallel account (<a href="/1_samuel/31-5.htm">1 Samuel 31:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenes of self-inflicted death follow utter despair&#8212;Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-54.htm">Judges 9:54</a>), Ahithophel (<a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>), and Judas (<a href="/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; While the text reports the act, it never condones it; life belongs to God alone (<a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p>&#8226; His decision shows extreme loyalty mixed with hopelessness&#8212;a tragic picture of a man who shared Saul&#8217;s fate but not Saul&#8217;s throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and died</b><p>The final words seal the narrative: two deaths, one verdict. Notice how Scripture ties up the account:<p>&#8226; &#8220;So Saul died together with his three sons, all his house died together&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">1 Chronicles 10:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The disaster spreads beyond Saul; when leaders fall, many are swept away (<a href="/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty stands: Israel loses a king, yet the LORD&#8217;s plan for David&#8212;and ultimately Messiah&#8212;moves forward (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/10-5.htm">1 Chronicles 10:5</a> shows the immediate ripple effect of Saul&#8217;s judgment. The armor-bearer, seeing the king dead, follows him in suicide&#8212;an act of misplaced loyalty and despair. The verse underscores that when a leader rejects God, those closest to him often share the consequences. Yet even in this grim moment, Scripture quietly points to God&#8217;s unbroken purpose: clearing the way for the shepherd-king David and, generations later, the true King, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">He fell likewise on the sword.</span>--Sam., "his sword," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the sword of the armour-bearer.<p><span class= "bld">And died.</span>--Samuel adds "with him," which seems to be omitted here for brevity, which may be the reason of other similar omissions.
