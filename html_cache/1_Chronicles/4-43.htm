They were descendants of Esau, as noted in <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>. The Israelites' conflict with the Amalekites began during the Exodus when the Amalekites attacked them at Rephidim (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). God commanded the Israelites to blot out the memory of Amalek (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>), and King Saul was later instructed to destroy them completely (<a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a>). However, Saul's failure to fully obey led to ongoing conflicts. The "remnant" here refers to those who survived previous battles, indicating that the Israelites were fulfilling God's command to eradicate this persistent threat. This act can be seen as a continuation of divine justice against a people who opposed God's purposes.<p><b>And they have lived there to this day.</b><br>This phrase suggests a lasting settlement by the Israelites in the territory previously occupied by the Amalekites. The phrase "to this day" is a common biblical expression indicating the time of the text's writing. It implies stability and continuity for the tribe of Simeon, who are the implied subjects of this passage. This settlement reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel regarding the land. It also highlights the theme of divine providence, as God provides for His people by granting them victory and a place to dwell. The historical context suggests that this settlement contributed to the tribal identity and territorial claims of the Simeonites within the larger narrative of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simeonites.htm">The Simeonites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Simeon, who were involved in the conquest of the Amalekites as described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekites.htm">The Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe often in conflict with Israel, representing persistent opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_seir.htm">Mount Seir</a></b><br>The region where the remnant of the Amalekites was struck down by the Simeonites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>The remaining Amalekites who had escaped previous conflicts and were living in Mount Seir.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_settlement.htm">The Settlement</a></b><br>The Simeonites settled in the region after defeating the Amalekites, indicating a change in territorial control.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_judgment.htm">God's Faithfulness in Judgment</a></b><br>God's promise to judge the Amalekites is fulfilled, demonstrating His faithfulness to His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's incomplete obedience in <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a> led to continued conflict with the Amalekites, highlighting the importance of complete obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The Amalekites symbolize spiritual opposition.
