This act of distribution occurs during the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a significant event in Israel's history. The inclusivity reflects the communal nature of worship and celebration in ancient Israel, emphasizing unity among God's people. This act can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of equality in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>a loaf of bread</b><br>Bread is a staple food in the ancient Near East and symbolizes sustenance and provision. In biblical terms, bread often represents God's provision for His people, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16). This distribution of bread by David can be seen as a type of Christ, who later declares Himself the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering spiritual sustenance to all who believe.<p><b>a date cake</b><br>Date cakes were a common delicacy in ancient Israel, made from pressed dates and often used in festive occasions. The inclusion of date cakes in the distribution signifies the abundance and joy associated with the return of the Ark. This act of giving reflects the generosity and celebratory nature of the event, reminiscent of the feasts and celebrations commanded in the Law (Leviticus 23).<p><b>and a raisin cake</b><br>Raisin cakes, like date cakes, were considered a luxury and were often associated with celebrations and offerings (<a href="/hosea/3.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). The giving of raisin cakes further emphasizes the festive atmosphere and the importance of the occasion. In a broader biblical context, the provision of such delicacies can be seen as a foretaste of the Messianic banquet, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, culminating in the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who orchestrated the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and led the celebration, including the distribution of food to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who gathered to celebrate the return of the Ark and received the gifts from King David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Ark of the Covenant was brought and where the celebration took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/celebration.htm">Celebration</a></b><br>The event marking the return of the Ark, characterized by worship, music, offerings, and the distribution of food.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_and_leadership.htm">Generosity and Leadership</a></b><br>David's act of distributing food demonstrates a leader's responsibility to care for the physical needs of the people.

But it is highest honour, as servant and instrument alone, to figure forth him in any way. The second little clause tells us either that <span class="cmt_word">women</span> took a recognized place on occasion of this joyous festival, or that the hospitality of such an occasion did not forget them and their homes.

But there is no doubt, or but little, that the rendering should rather be "dried, pressed cakes of raisins or grapes." It is then to be derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (to press). The substantive has both masculine and feminine form in plural. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">similam frixam oleo</span>, which means a "baked cake of flour and oil;" and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the parallel places. But here the Septuagint reads <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> the whole account of the loaf, the good piece of flesh, and the flagon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he distributed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1511;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7717;al&#183;l&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
