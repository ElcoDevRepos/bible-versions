After the deaths of Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar took on the priestly duties. The phrase indicates a numerical superiority in leadership among Eleazar's descendants, which may reflect God's favor or the fulfillment of His purposes. This division of leadership is significant in maintaining order and structure in the priestly duties. The emphasis on leadership among Eleazar's descendants can be seen as a reflection of God's sovereign choice, similar to how He chose the tribe of Levi for priestly service.<p><b>they were divided accordingly</b><br>The division of the priestly families was a practical solution to ensure the fair distribution of duties in the temple service. This division was likely done by casting lots, a common biblical method for making decisions (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The division reflects the importance of order and organization in worship, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the division of labor in Nehemiah's rebuilding of the wall (Nehemiah 3). This structured approach ensured that all priestly families had a role in the temple service, preventing any single family from monopolizing the priesthood.<p><b>There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar</b><br>The number sixteen signifies the larger representation of Eleazar's line, which may indicate a greater number of qualified leaders or a larger family size. This division into sixteen groups allowed for a more extensive rotation of duties, ensuring that the temple service was continually maintained. The number sixteen can also be seen as a symbol of completeness in the context of priestly service, ensuring that all aspects of worship were covered.<p><b>and eight from the descendants of Ithamar</b><br>The number eight, while smaller, still represents a significant portion of the priestly duties. The division into eight groups allowed Ithamar's descendants to participate fully in the temple service. The number eight often symbolizes new beginnings in the Bible, such as the eighth day being the start of a new week. This could imply a fresh start or renewal for Ithamar's line in their service to God. Despite being fewer in number, Ithamar's descendants were equally important in maintaining the continuity and integrity of the priestly functions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar.htm">Eleazar</a></b><br>The third son of Aaron, Eleazar succeeded his father as the high priest.

Eleazar&#8217;s branch, descending from Aaron&#8217;s third son (<a href="/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>), had produced more qualified heads than Ithamar&#8217;s. This matters because:<p>&#8226; Leadership in worship had to reflect actual spiritual and administrative capacity (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s earlier promise&#8212;&#8220;I will be sanctified by those who draw near Me&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>)&#8212;required spiritually fit leaders.<p>The text assumes divine sovereignty over family growth (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>) and over the call to ministry (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were divided accordingly</b><p>1 Chron 24:4b continues, &#8220;they were divided accordingly.&#8221; David does not force parity; he aligns the courses with reality.
