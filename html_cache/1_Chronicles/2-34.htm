This detail highlights the importance of daughters in continuing family lines when no sons were present. The mention of daughters in genealogies is relatively rare, indicating their crucial role in this instance. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of God working through unexpected means and people, as seen in other instances where women play pivotal roles in biblical narratives, such as Ruth and Esther.<p><b>He also had an Egyptian servant named Jarha.</b><br>The mention of Jarha, an Egyptian servant, is significant in several ways. First, it underscores the presence and integration of foreigners within Israelite society, which was not uncommon given Israel's geographical location and history. The inclusion of an Egyptian servant in the genealogy suggests a level of acceptance and assimilation, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's plan encompassing all nations. This can be seen in the Abrahamic covenant, where all nations are to be blessed through Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Additionally, the fact that Jarha is named indicates his importance in the narrative, as servants are not always mentioned by name. This could also be seen as a foreshadowing of the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, a theme that is fully realized in the New Testament with the spread of the Gospel to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheshan.htm">Sheshan</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Judah, specifically from the family of Jerahmeel.

Lineage and land normally flowed from father to son (<a href="/numbers/1-18.htm">Numbers 1:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Sheshan belonged to the tribe of Judah, the absence of a male heir might seem to threaten that branch of the royal line; yet God&#8217;s sovereignty over genealogy is on display all through 1 Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>, <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord overcoming apparent dead ends&#8212;Abraham and Sarah&#8217;s barrenness (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10-14</a>) or Hannah&#8217;s (<a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-20</a>)&#8212;so the statement invites us to watch for His provision here as well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But only daughters</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but only daughters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The text affirms the value of daughters by recording them; that is unusual in ancient genealogies. God ensures they are not invisible (cf. <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-8</a>, where daughters receive an inheritance; <a href="/job/42-13.htm">Job 42:13-15</a>, where daughters are named alongside sons).<p>&#8226; Sheshan will later give one of these daughters to Jarha in marriage (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-35.htm">1 Chronicles 2:35</a>), echoing how the daughters of Zelophehad safeguarded their family&#8217;s portion by marrying within the tribe (<a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention anticipates <a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>, where a virtuous woman&#8217;s legacy is honored. God&#8217;s plan never sidelines women; He weaves them into salvation history, as with Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>), Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>), and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also had an Egyptian servant named Jarha</b><p>The verse continues: &#8220;He also had an Egyptian servant named Jarha.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jarha&#8217;s nationality reminds us of the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; that left Egypt with Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>). Foreigners could join the covenant people by faith (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-7</a>).<p>&#8226; In the next verse Sheshan gives his daughter to Jarha, and their son Attai continues the Judahite line (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-35.htm">1 Chronicles 2:35-36</a>). God keeps His promises even by incorporating a Gentile servant&#8212;foreshadowing the grafting in of the nations (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jarha moves from servant to son-in-law, paralleling how believers move from slaves to sons through Christ (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-34.htm">1 Chronicles 2:34</a> teaches that God&#8217;s covenant purposes are never thwarted.

The verse showcases the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness, the dignity He grants women, and His gracious inclusion of outsiders&#8212;assuring us that He will likewise fulfill every promise He has made to us in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Now Sheshan had no sons, but daughters.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/2-31.htm" title="And the sons of Appaim; Ishi.
