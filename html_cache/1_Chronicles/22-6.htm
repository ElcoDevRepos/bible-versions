This moment signifies the transfer of responsibility and divine purpose from father to son. Solomon, whose name means "peace," is a fitting choice to build the temple, as his reign is characterized by peace and prosperity, unlike David's, which was marked by warfare. This calling also reflects the biblical principle of generational legacy and the importance of preparing the next generation for God's work.<p><b>and instructed him to build a house for the LORD</b><br>David's instruction to Solomon to build the temple is significant because David himself was not permitted by God to build it due to his history as a warrior (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>). The "house for the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for Israel and a symbol of God's presence among His people. This task emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's plans and the fulfillment of divine promises, as God had promised David that his son would build the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The temple is not just a physical structure but a testament to God's faithfulness and His unique relationship with Israel. It serves as a reminder of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the establishment of Israel as His chosen people. The temple's construction is a fulfillment of God's covenantal promises and a foreshadowing of the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity through Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desired to build a temple for the Lord but was instructed by God that his son would fulfill this task.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David, chosen to build the temple, symbolizing peace and wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_for_the_lord.htm">The House for the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who dwells among His people and desires a place of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was to be built, significant as the spiritual and political center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_purpose_and_timing.htm">Divine Purpose and Timing</a></b><br>God&#8217;s plans often extend beyond our lifetime, and His purposes are fulfilled in His timing.

This shows fatherly concern and kingly responsibility.<p>&#8226; The call underlines God&#8217;s choice of Solomon as successor (1 Chron 28:5&#8211;7; <a href="/1_kings/1-29.htm">1 Kings 1:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; Passing the baton this way reflects how one generation must actively hand on God&#8217;s purposes to the next (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and instructed him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and instructed him&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s words are more than suggestions; they are a charge (1 Chron 28:8&#8211;10).<p>&#8226; Scripture places weight on parents teaching children (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1&#8211;4</a>). Here, the instruction concerns both leadership and obedience to the Lord (<a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Because David could not build the temple himself (1 Chron 22:8), he ensures Solomon understands God&#8217;s will. Obedience must be intentional and communicated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to build a house</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to build a house&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;House&#8221; refers to the physical temple, the worship center promised in <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a> and echoed in 1 Chron 17:11&#8211;12.<p>&#8226; David has already stockpiled materials, craftsmen, and treasure (1 Chron 22:2&#8211;4, 14&#8211;16). Provision and planning precede the work God assigns.<p>&#8226; The temple would visibly manifest God&#8217;s dwelling among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-11.htm">1 Kings 6:11&#8211;13</a>).

The temple is for Yahweh alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Him &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221; stresses covenant faithfulness. The same God who delivered them from Egypt now invites them to draw near (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-23.htm">1 Kings 8:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Solomon will dedicate the temple, praying that God&#8217;s eyes and heart remain there perpetually (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27&#8211;30</a>; 2 Chron 6:41). Even so, the temple points forward to Christ, &#8220;something greater than the temple&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>; <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19&#8211;21</a>), through whom God dwells with His people forever (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s summons, instruction, building charge, and God-centered focus reveal a seamless handoff of divine mission from father to son.

Upon grounds of internal evidence we may pronounce this dying address of David to be an ideal composition, put into the king's mouth by the unknown author whose work the chronicler follows: or rather, perhaps, by the chronicler himself, whose style is evident throughout.
