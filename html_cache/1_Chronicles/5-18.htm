Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh were granted this land by Moses due to their large herds and desire for pastureland (Numbers 32). Their location made them vulnerable to attacks from surrounding nations, necessitating a strong military presence. This settlement also fulfilled part of the promise to Abraham regarding the land his descendants would inherit (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>had 44,760 warriors</b><br>This specific number indicates a well-documented census, reflecting the importance of military readiness. The large number of warriors suggests a significant population and the need for defense against neighboring enemies. This census is reminiscent of the detailed genealogies and censuses found throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing order and preparation (Numbers 1).<p><b>valiant men</b><br>The term "valiant" highlights their bravery and strength, qualities highly esteemed in biblical narratives. These men were not only numerous but also courageous, echoing the valor of other biblical figures like David's mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>). Valor was essential for the protection and survival of the Israelite tribes in hostile territories.<p><b>who carried the shield and sword</b><br>The shield and sword were standard military equipment, symbolizing readiness for close combat. The use of these weapons indicates a well-equipped and organized military force. The imagery of the shield and sword is also used metaphorically in Scripture to describe God's protection and the believer's spiritual armor (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16-17</a>).<p><b>drew the bow</b><br>Archery was a crucial skill in ancient warfare, allowing for long-range attacks. The ability to draw the bow signifies versatility and preparedness for various combat situations. This skill is also mentioned in the context of other biblical warriors, such as Jonathan, who was noted for his archery (<a href="/1_samuel/20-20.htm">1 Samuel 20:20</a>).<p><b>and were trained for battle</b><br>Training for battle implies discipline and strategic planning, essential for successful military campaigns. This preparation reflects the broader biblical theme of being ready and equipped for challenges, both physical and spiritual. The concept of training is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to be spiritually prepared (<a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7-8</a>).<br><br>Each phrase in this verse underscores the military strength and preparedness of these tribes, highlighting their role in the defense and stability of Israel's eastern frontier.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites.htm">Reubenites</a></b><br>Descendants of Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob, who settled east of the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gadites.htm">Gadites</a></b><br>Descendants of Gad, another son of Jacob, who also settled east of the Jordan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>Part of the tribe of Manasseh, which was divided between territories on both sides of the Jordan River.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/4/44,760_warriors.htm">44,760 Warriors</a></b><br>A significant number of trained soldiers from these tribes, indicating their military strength and readiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_of_the_jordan.htm">East of the Jordan</a></b><br>The region where these tribes settled, known for its strategic importance and frequent conflicts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_for_spiritual_battles.htm">Preparedness for Spiritual Battles</a></b><br>Just as the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh were trained and ready for physical battle, Christians are called to be spiritually prepared. <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a> encourages believers to put on the full armor of God to stand against spiritual challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_cooperation.htm">Unity and Cooperation</a></b><br>Despite being geographically separated, these tribes were united with the rest of Israel in purpose and mission.
