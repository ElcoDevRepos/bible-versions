His story is detailed in 2 Samuel, where he is known for his rebellion against his father, King David. Absalom's mother, Maacah, was the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur, a small Aramean kingdom northeast of the Sea of Galilee. This marriage likely served as a political alliance, common in ancient times to secure peace and strengthen ties between nations. Absalom's mixed heritage may have influenced his later actions and ambitions. His rebellion and tragic end are seen as a fulfillment of the consequences of David's sin with Bathsheba, as prophesied by Nathan the prophet (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>).<p><b>the fourth was Adonijah the son of Haggith;</b><br>Adonijah, another son of David, plays a crucial role in the succession narrative of the Israelite monarchy. His mother, Haggith, is mentioned several times, but little is known about her beyond her role as Adonijah's mother. Adonijah's attempt to claim the throne is recorded in <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, where he declares himself king while David is still alive. This act of self-exaltation parallels Absalom's earlier rebellion and highlights the ongoing strife within David's family. Adonijah's story underscores the theme of divine sovereignty in the selection of Israel's kings, as ultimately, Solomon, not Adonijah, is chosen by God to succeed David. This narrative also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the true King from the line of David, who establishes an eternal kingdom not through human ambition but through divine appointment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his rebellion against his father.
