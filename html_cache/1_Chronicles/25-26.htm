The name Mallothi means "my fullness" or "my utterance," which may suggest a role in vocal or instrumental expression in worship.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers&#8212;</b><br>The inclusion of both sons and brothers indicates a family-based approach to temple service, which was common in the Levitical tradition. This familial involvement underscores the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood and the passing down of roles and responsibilities through generations. It also highlights the communal aspect of worship, where families served together in the temple.<p><b>12 in all;</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often symbolizing completeness or divine order.
