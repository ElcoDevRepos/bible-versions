It underscores the prophetic nature of David's leadership and his relationship with God. The phrase suggests a direct revelation, emphasizing the authority and authenticity of the message. This is consistent with other instances where God communicates His will, such as with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p><b>&#8216;You have shed much blood and waged great wars:</b><br>David was a warrior king, known for his military conquests and the expansion of Israel's territory. This phrase acknowledges his role in securing the nation through warfare, which was often necessary for the survival and establishment of Israel. However, it also highlights a divine perspective on the consequences of such actions. The shedding of blood, while sometimes sanctioned by God for the protection and establishment of His people, is also seen as a reason for David not being chosen to build the temple. This reflects a biblical theme where God desires peace and holiness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, where nations are called to beat swords into plowshares.<p><b>You are not to build a house for My Name:</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple, a central place of worship for Israel. Building a temple was a significant task, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The phrase indicates a divine decision that David, despite his desire and preparation, was not the one to construct it. This task was reserved for Solomon, David's son, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-6.htm">1 Chronicles 28:6</a>. The temple was to be a place of peace, and thus it was fitting for a king of peace, Solomon, to build it.<p><b>because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me:</b><br>This reiterates the reason for God's decision, emphasizing the gravity of David's actions in the sight of God. The repetition underscores the seriousness of bloodshed, even in the context of divine warfare. It reflects a broader biblical principle that God values life and peace, and that the establishment of His dwelling place should be associated with these values. This also foreshadows the coming of Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who establishes a new covenant not through warfare but through sacrifice and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desired to build a temple for the Lord but was prohibited due to his history as a warrior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>David's son, who was chosen by God to build the temple instead of David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The house of the Lord that David wanted to build, which would later be constructed by Solomon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who communicated His will to David regarding the building of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wars_and_battles.htm">Wars and Battles</a></b><br>The numerous conflicts in which David participated, which were a factor in God's decision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty in Plans</a></b><br>God has a specific plan and purpose for each individual.

And see also Hosea's denunciation of vengeance upon the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel: <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.">Hosea 1:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-7.htm" title="They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calls to me.">Hosea 7:7</a>). Or the verse may express the interpretation which David's own conscience put upon the oracle forbidding him to build the Temple. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast shed much blood</span>. This is repeated very distinctly below (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), and appears there again as acknowledged by the lip of David himself. It seems remarkable that no previous statement of this objection, nor even allusion to it, is found. Further, there seems no very opportune place for it in either our <a href="/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1-15</a> or in <a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-17</a>. Yet, if it seem impossible to resist the impression that it must have found expression on the occasion referred to in those two passages, we may fit it in best between vers. 10 and 11 of the former reference, and between vers. 11 and 12 of the latter. So far, however, as our Hebrew text goes, this is the first place in which the statement is made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but this word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
