This reflects the biblical principle of seeking divine wisdom (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). David's inquiry demonstrates humility and dependence on God, a model for believers in decision-making (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Should I go up against the Philistines?&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent enemy of Israel, often representing opposition to God's people. This question shows David's strategic and spiritual approach to warfare, acknowledging God's sovereignty over military matters. The Philistines' presence in the land is a recurring theme, symbolizing spiritual battles believers face (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>Will You deliver them into my hand?&#8221;</b><br>David's question reveals his faith in God's power to grant victory. The phrase "deliver them into my hand" indicates reliance on divine intervention rather than human strength. This echoes the biblical theme of God fighting for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>) and foreshadows Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Go,&#8221; replied the LORD</b><br>God's direct response to David underscores the importance of divine guidance. The assurance of God's presence and support is a recurring biblical promise (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). This command to "go" parallels the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where believers are sent with God's authority.<p><b>&#8220;for I will deliver them into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>The promise of victory is a testament to God's faithfulness and power. This assurance is reminiscent of God's promises to the patriarchs and leaders of Israel (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). It also typifies Christ's assurance of victory over spiritual enemies (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>), encouraging believers to trust in God's deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his leadership.

That pattern of asking rather than assuming is seen in <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2 and 30</a>:8, where he also &#8220;inquired of the LORD&#8221; before taking military steps. Scripture commends this attitude:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> urges us to &#8220;trust in the LORD with all your heart&#8230; and He will make your paths straight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> reminds believers that God &#8220;gives generously to all without finding fault&#8221; when we ask for wisdom.<p>David&#8217;s example teaches that strength and past victories never excuse prayerlessness; dependence on God remains vital.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Should I go up against the Philistines?</b><p>The first of David&#8217;s two questions is practical: Is this the time for confrontation? Even though he had fought the Philistines many times (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-21</a>), he does not presume a standing order. <a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a> records a similar moment when Israel &#8220;went to Bethel and inquired of God&#8221; before battle. Such moments highlight that God&#8217;s will is not guessed but sought.<p>&#8226; Waiting for God&#8217;s timing prevents self-made plans that end in defeat (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40-45</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience is about more than what we do; it includes when and how we do it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will You deliver them into my hand?</b><p>David&#8217;s second question is theological: Will victory come from the Lord&#8217;s hand? He is asking if God&#8217;s purpose aligns with Israel&#8217;s need. The wording echoes <a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>, where God promised, &#8220;Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand.&#8221; By asking, David acknowledges:<p>&#8226; Success rests on God&#8217;s intervention, not human skill (<a href="/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Every battle is part of a larger divine storyline in which God protects His covenant people (<a href="/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go, replied the LORD</b><p>The Lord answers clearly and affirmatively. This immediate response parallels <a href="/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>, where God told David, &#8220;Pursue them, for you will surely overtake them.&#8221; God&#8217;s direct permission removes all doubt and energizes obedience.<p>&#8226; When God says &#8220;Go,&#8221; hesitation is disobedience (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine guidance often follows earnest, humble inquiry (<a href="/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I will deliver them into your hand</b><p>The promise of victory shifts the focus from David&#8217;s might to God&#8217;s faithfulness. Similar assurances appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>, &#8220;For the LORD your God is the One who goes with you&#8230; to give you victory,&#8221; and <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>, &#8220;The battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises empower courageous action (<a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance is a reminder that every win belongs to the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/14-10.htm">1 Chronicles 14:10</a> presents a pattern for faithful living: ask God first, clarify both timing and outcome, listen for His reply, and move forward trusting His promise of deliverance. David&#8217;s humility in inquiry, God&#8217;s clarity in command, and the assurance of victory together demonstrate that dependence on the Lord is the true key to success.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And David enquired of God.</span>--How?
