The name "Baal-hanan" suggests a connection to the Canaanite deity Baal, indicating the syncretism present in Edomite culture. His death marks a transition in leadership, a common theme in the biblical narrative where the death of a leader often leads to significant changes or challenges for the people.<p><b>Hadad reigned in his place</b><br>Hadad is a name associated with a storm and fertility god in ancient Near Eastern cultures, particularly among the Arameans and Canaanites. This reflects the continued influence of surrounding cultures on Edom. The transition of power to Hadad signifies the continuation of a dynastic line, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the importance of leadership and governance.<p><b>His city was named Pau</b><br>Pau is identified as the city associated with Hadad's reign. The location of Pau is not definitively known, but it is part of the Edomite territory. The mention of a specific city underscores the importance of urban centers in ancient governance and the role of cities as seats of power and administration.<p><b>and his wife&#8217;s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred</b><br>Mehetabel's name means "God makes happy," indicating a possible Israelite influence or connection, as the name includes "El," a name for God in Hebrew. The mention of her lineage, being the daughter of Matred, suggests the importance of family heritage and alliances through marriage, which were crucial in maintaining and expanding influence and power in ancient times.<p><b>the daughter of Me-zahab</b><br>Me-zahab means "waters of gold," which could imply wealth or prosperity. This reference to her grandfather highlights the significance of ancestry and the transmission of status and wealth through generations. It also reflects the biblical emphasis on genealogies, which serve to establish identity and legitimacy within the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal-hanan.htm">Baal-hanan</a></b><br>A king mentioned in the genealogies of Edom, who reigned before Hadad.
