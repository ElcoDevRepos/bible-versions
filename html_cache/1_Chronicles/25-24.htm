This reflects the organized and structured approach David took in worship, emphasizing the importance of music in temple services. The name Joshbekashah means "the Lord has judged," which may indicate a family history or personal testimony of God's justice. This order of musicians highlights the significance of worship in Israel's spiritual life, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-24</a>, where the Levites and priests are also organized for temple service.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers</b><br>The inclusion of sons and brothers suggests a family-based ministry, which was common in the Levitical service. This reflects the biblical principle of passing down faith and service to the next generation, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. It also underscores the communal and familial nature of worship in ancient Israel, where families often served together in the temple. This practice ensured continuity and stability in worship practices and reinforced the communal identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people.<p><b>12 in all</b><br>The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or divine government, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. In this context, the number may represent the completeness of the musical group or the fullness of their service. It also reflects the organized nature of temple worship, where each group had a specific role and number, ensuring that worship was conducted in an orderly and reverent manner.
