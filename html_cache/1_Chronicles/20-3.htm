The people mentioned are likely the surviving inhabitants of the city. In the context of ancient warfare, it was common for victors to take captives and utilize them for labor. This action reflects the practices of the time, where conquered peoples were often subjected to servitude.<p><b>and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes.</b><br>The tools mentioned&#8212;saws, iron picks, and axes&#8212;indicate the type of labor the captives were forced to perform, likely involving construction or agricultural work. The use of iron tools suggests a level of technological advancement and the importance of iron in the period. This labor could be seen as a form of subjugation and control, ensuring the captives contributed to the victors' economy and infrastructure.<p><b>And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities.</b><br>David's actions were not limited to Rabbah but extended to other Ammonite cities, indicating a systematic approach to consolidating control over the region. This reflects the broader strategy of ensuring dominance and stability in newly conquered territories. The Ammonites were long-standing adversaries of Israel, and this subjugation would have been seen as a fulfillment of divine justice and a means to prevent future hostilities.<p><b>Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.</b><br>The return to Jerusalem signifies the completion of the military campaign and the restoration of peace and order. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Israel, was the logical place for David to return to after securing his borders. This return also symbolizes the centralization of power and the importance of Jerusalem in David's reign. The narrative underscores David's role as a warrior king who expands and secures the kingdom, a type of Christ as the ultimate King who establishes His reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military conquests and leadership.

We have here the very doubtful (so far as regards its real signification) Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (and he cut) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (he put). Probably it is nowhere else used in the sense of "cutting," if it is here. Its ordinary sense is to rule or put into subjection. The parallel place (<a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>) corrects, in the word (Authorized Version) <span class="accented">axes</span>, our Hebrew text, which repeats the word for saw, though putting it in the plural, and which thereby shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This last word means "Axes" or "scythes," and is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;</span>, to cut (<a href="/2_kings/6-4.htm">2 Kings 6:4</a>). It is found only in <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, though it should appear here also. There is a fourth severity of punishment mentioned in the parallel place, that the people were "made to pass through the brick-kilns," a form of torture possibly suggested by the own familiar cruelty of the Ammonites in "making their children to pass through the fire to Moloch." However, in harmony with what is above said respecting the doubtfulness of the just signification of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, much uncertainty hangs over the interpretation of this verse. Instead of severity and needless cruelty on the part of David, it may rather set forth that he <span class="accented">subjected</span> them to hard tasks in connection with the cultivation of the soil and with the making of bricks. The saws and harrows and axes (or scythes) were awkward and unlikely weapons to be employed for the purpose of inflicting torture, when the ordinary weapons of battle and warfare were close at hand. This view, however, is contrary to the verdict, so far as the above Hebrew verb is concerned, of Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' p. 1326, and of Thenins, on this and the parallel passage. When such punishments were of the nature of torture, the cruelty was in some cases extreme. "The criminal was sometimes sawn asunder lengthwise; this was more especially the practice in Persia. Isaiah, according to the Talmud-isis, was put to death in this wise by King Manasseh, 'Sanhedrin,' p. 103, c. 2; comp. Justin's dialogue with Trypho" (Jahn's 'Sacred Antiquities,' p. 132, &sect; 260, 7.). <span class="accented">With saws.</span> The word in the original is not in the plural. It occurs again only in the parallel place (<a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>) and in <a href="/1_kings/7-9.htm">1 Kings 7:9</a>, both times in the singular. The teeth of Eastern saws then and now usually incline to the handle instead of from it. With harrows of iron. The only <span class="accented">harrow</span> known to have been used at this time consisted of a thick block of wood borne down by a weight, or on which a man sat, drawn over the ploughed land by oxen (<a href="/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24, 25</a>; <a href="/job/39-10.htm">Job 39:10</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>), and the root of the Hebrew word expresses the idea of crushing or levelling the land. But our present word is very different, and is found only here and in the parallel place, with the word "iron" accompanying it, so as to be equivalent to a compound word, and appears to mean "sharp instruments of iron," or sharp threshing instruments. The use of the former part of this phrase (<a href="/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>) for <span class="accented">cheeses</span> is the only other instance of its occurrence. <span class="accented">Saws</span> should be "axes," or "scythes," as stated above, though it is not any of the three more ordinary words for "axe" (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[David] brought out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
