Gath was one of the five Philistine cities and is often associated with giants, most notably Goliath, whom David defeated earlier in his life (1 Samuel 17). The presence of giants in Gath highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines. The Rephaim are mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>, indicating their formidable nature and the challenge they posed to Israel. The mention of Gath connects this passage to the broader narrative of David's military campaigns against the Philistines.<p><b>fell at the hands of David and his servants</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the victory of David and his men over the giants, showcasing God's favor and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. David's leadership and the valor of his servants are central themes in the narrative of his reign. The defeat of these giants can be seen as a continuation of God's deliverance of Israel from formidable foes, similar to the earlier victory over Goliath. This victory also prefigures the ultimate triumph of Jesus Christ over sin and death, as David is often seen as a type of Christ, a foreshadowing of the Messiah who would come from his lineage. The phrase underscores the importance of faith and reliance on God in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess and deep faith in God.

Scripture tells the story in a continuous flow&#8212;battle after battle, giant after giant&#8212;showing the LORD&#8217;s steady faithfulness to Israel (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/21-18.htm">2 Samuel 21:18-22</a>). The conjunction signals that what happens next is the logical and inevitable outcome of God&#8217;s ongoing intervention on David&#8217;s behalf.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>these descendants of Rapha</b><p>&#8220;Rapha&#8221; points to the Rephaim, a race of formidable warriors renowned for extraordinary size and strength (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20-21</a>). Earlier in the chapter we meet:<p>&#8226; Sippai (v. 4)<p>&#8226; Lahmi, brother of Goliath (v. 5)<p>&#8226; An unnamed giant with six fingers and six toes (v. 6)<p>Each belonged to this same line. By mentioning their heritage again, the writer underscores how even the greatest human power is no match for the LORD, echoing the earlier triumph over Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48-51</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Gath</b><p>Gath was one of the five principal Philistine cities (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>). It produced multiple giants, including Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>). Placing the scene there reminds the reader that God&#8217;s people can experience decisive victories right in the enemy&#8217;s stronghold. Just as the ark once humbled Dagon in Ashdod (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-4</a>), so now David&#8217;s campaigns humble the giants of Gath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fell</b><p>The verb highlights total defeat. These warriors did not merely retreat; they were struck down. <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34-39</a> celebrates how the LORD &#8220;subdued my enemies beneath me&#8221;, matching the chronicler&#8217;s emphasis that the fall of the giants was the LORD&#8217;s doing through human agents.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the hands of David</b><p>God&#8217;s covenant king leads the charge. Earlier, David had personally faced Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49-51</a>); here he oversees&#8212;and participates in&#8212;successive victories, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> that the Spirit of the LORD would remain on him. The phrase reminds us that leadership marked by faith secures blessing for the entire nation (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his servants</b><p>David&#8217;s men share in the triumph. Names like Sibbecai, Elhanan, and Jonathan appear in verses 4-7, illustrating how courageous followers rise under godly leadership. Their exploits echo Joshua&#8217;s charge in <a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a> to be &#8220;strong and courageous,&#8221; showing that bold faith is contagious. Together they model the New Testament principle that the body of Christ works as one (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/20-8.htm">1 Chronicles 20:8</a> records the climax of a series of giant-slaying victories. The verse teaches that when the LORD fights for His people, even the fiercest enemies&#8212;giants in their own territory&#8212;fall. David, empowered by God, leads, and faithful servants join him. The chronicler invites every generation to remember that no adversary, however imposing, can withstand the purposes of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">These </span>(<span class= "ital">'?l</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> a rare word, found eight times in the Pentateuch with the article, here only without; perhaps an error of transcription. Samuel, "these four." The chronicler has omitted one giant. (See <a href="/1_chronicles/20-4.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.">1Chronicles 20:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The giant.</span>--<span class= "ital">The Rephaite:</span> that is, the clan or tribe of Rephaim.

The parallel place reads, "These <span class="accented">four</span>,,' <span class="accented">etc.</span> The first of the four in view there is not mentioned here. The account is given in <a href="/2_samuel/21-15.htm">2 Samuel 21:15-17</a>. And as it was in <span class="accented">that</span> encounter that David himself played the chief part (though, apparently, it was Abishai who dealt Ishbi-benob the fatal blow in "succouring" David), the notice of it would have seemed necessary to complete fully the sense of the following clauses, "They fell by the hand <span class="accented">of David</span>, and by the hand of his servants." Still this, it may justly be argued, may have been the very reason of the form of expression here chosen, coupling David's work and that of his servants. This brief summary in the last verse of this chapter, as also in the last verse of the corresponding chapter, just serves to reveal to us the nexus that bound together the three or four exploits for narration. It consisted in the common descent of the four giant victims. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/20-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_411.htm">Strong's 411: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#363;l&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Rapha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
