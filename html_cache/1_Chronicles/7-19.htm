The tribe of Manasseh was one of the two half-tribes that settled on both sides of the Jordan River. This lineage highlights the importance of family and tribal connections in Israel's history. The genealogies in Chronicles serve to establish the continuity of God's people and their inheritance in the Promised Land.<p><b>Ahian:</b><br>The name Ahian means "brotherly" or "fraternal." Names in biblical times often carried significant meaning, reflecting character or destiny. Ahian's inclusion in the genealogy underscores the importance of each family member in the broader narrative of Israel's history, even if specific deeds are not recorded.<p><b>Shechem:</b><br>Shechem is both a person and a significant city in biblical history. The city of Shechem was a central location in the land of Canaan, known for its early association with Abraham and later as a city of refuge. The name here likely refers to a person, but it evokes the city's historical and spiritual significance as a place of covenant renewal and worship.<p><b>Likhi:</b><br>Little is known about Likhi, as he is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. His inclusion in the genealogy emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the chronicler's record, ensuring that all branches of the family are acknowledged. This reflects the biblical theme of God's concern for all individuals within His covenant community.<p><b>Aniam:</b><br>Aniam's name means "people of grace" or "people of favor." This name may reflect the hope or prayer of the family for God's favor upon their descendants. The chronicler's attention to detail in listing these names serves to remind readers of the personal nature of God's relationship with His people, where each individual and family is known and valued.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemida.htm">Shemida</a></b><br>A descendant of Manasseh, one of the tribes of Israel.

<a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; By introducing the names that follow, the chronicler reminds us that every individual matters to God, even when their stories are not fully recorded (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sons of Shemida:</b><p>&#8226;

Other passages do not mention him, yet the Lord deemed his name worth preserving (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; His presence testifies that significance is rooted not in fame but in belonging to God&#8217;s people (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226;
