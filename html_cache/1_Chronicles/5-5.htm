The name Micah means "Who is like Yahweh?" and is a common name in the Old Testament, also associated with the prophet Micah. This lineage highlights the continuation of the Reubenite line despite Reuben losing his birthright due to his transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>). The mention of Micah here serves to trace the genealogy and maintain the historical record of the tribes of Israel.<p><b>Reaiah his son</b><br>Reaiah, also known as Reaia, is a less prominent figure in the biblical narrative. His name means "Yahweh has seen." The inclusion of Reaiah in this genealogy underscores the importance of family lineage in Israelite culture, where ancestry was crucial for tribal identity and inheritance rights. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant people through generations.<p><b>Baal his son</b><br>Baal, in this context, is a personal name and not to be confused with the Canaanite deity Baal, which was often a source of idolatry and conflict for Israel. The use of the name Baal here may indicate a period before the name became associated with pagan worship. This highlights the cultural shifts and the evolving understanding of names and their associations over time. The genealogy serves as a reminder of the complex history of Israel and the need for faithfulness to God amidst surrounding influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A descendant in the genealogy of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel.

The mention of Micah marks the fifth generation after Joel (v.4).<p>&#8211; Genealogies in Scripture are not filler; they are Spirit-breathed records that anchor real people in real history. Compare <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/1.htm">1 Chronicles 1</a> and <a href="/bsb/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> to see how God often threads His purposes through family lines.<p>&#8211; Micah&#8217;s placement shows continuity: God preserved Reuben&#8217;s descendants even after Reuben forfeited the firstborn&#8217;s double portion (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>). That loss did not erase the line; it simply redirected the blessing, as echoed in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a> where Judah received royal authority while Joseph gained the birthright.<p>&#8211; By highlighting Micah, the text reminds us that God knows every generation by name (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>; <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reaiah his son</b><p>&#8211; Reaiah, the son of Micah, reinforces the steady march of generations. Each &#8220;his son&#8221; signals an unbroken link, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness &#8220;to a thousand generations of those who love Him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>).<p>&#8211; The verse quietly answers skeptics who question Scripture&#8217;s historical reliability. Just as <a href="/bsb/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> carefully traces Jesus&#8217; ancestry, <a href="/1_chronicles/5-5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:5</a> traces Reuben&#8217;s, showing that biblical writers valued precise records (see <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8211; This single name also hints at corporate identity. Families form tribes, and tribes form the nation through which God revealed Himself. The same principle appears when Ezra catalogs returnees from exile (<a href="/bsb/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>) so that covenant obligations and privileges can be restored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baal his son</b><p>&#8211; Baal concludes the trio, and his name alerts us that not every Israelite bore a &#8220;safe&#8221; name. Later generations would sadly turn to Canaanite worship (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>), yet here his name is simply a historical fact. Scripture records even uncomfortable details, proving its honesty.<p>&#8211; The genealogy stops with Baal because the chronicler&#8217;s purpose is complete: to trace Reuben&#8217;s line to the moment when the tribe settled east of the Jordan (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-9.htm">1 Chronicles 5:9-10</a>).<p>&#8211; The mention of Baal foreshadows what happens when a family drifts spiritually. Reuben&#8217;s descendants eventually &#8220;acted treacherously against the God of their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25-26</a>), and God allowed Assyria to carry them into exile. This warns today&#8217;s readers that heritage alone cannot substitute for wholehearted devotion (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Micah, Reaiah, and Baal are more than names; they are mile-markers on the road of God&#8217;s sovereign work through Reuben. <a href="/1_chronicles/5-5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:5</a> showcases Scripture&#8217;s precision, God&#8217;s generational faithfulness, and the sober reminder that every lineage must choose obedience for itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Baal.</span>--Compare the names of Saul's posterity Eshbaal and Meribbaal;
