His words here reflect his role as a prophet and leader who communicated God's will to the people. This statement is part of David's preparations for the temple service, as he organized the Levites and priests for their duties. David's declarations often carried weight, as seen in other instances where he spoke of God's promises and plans (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>The LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The LORD (Yahweh) is the personal name of God, highlighting His eternal and unchanging nature. The title "God of Israel" underscores His special relationship with the nation He chose to be His people. This covenantal language is consistent throughout the Old Testament, reminding Israel of their unique identity and calling (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>has given rest to His people</b><br>The concept of "rest" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of peace and security. In this context, it refers to the cessation of warfare and the establishment of a stable kingdom under David's rule. This rest is a partial fulfillment of the promises made to the patriarchs and points forward to the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever</b><br>Jerusalem is central to Israel's identity and God's plan. The idea of God dwelling in Jerusalem signifies His presence among His people, particularly through the temple, which David's son Solomon would build. This dwelling is both literal and symbolic, representing God's commitment to His people. The phrase "forever" points to the eternal nature of God's covenant and foreshadows the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>, where God will dwell with His people eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and faithfulness to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He delivered from Egypt and established in the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God as the dwelling place for His name and the location of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rest.htm">Rest</a></b><br>A state of peace and security, symbolizing God's provision and fulfillment of His promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promise to dwell with His people is a testament to His unwavering faithfulness.
