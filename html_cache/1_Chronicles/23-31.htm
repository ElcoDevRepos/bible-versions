These offerings were entirely consumed by fire, representing complete surrender to the LORD. The practice dates back to the time of Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>) and was formalized in the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 1). The offerings were a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as He offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts</b><br>The Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts were significant times in the Jewish calendar for worship and remembrance. The Sabbath was a weekly day of rest and worship, instituted at creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and commanded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). New Moons marked the beginning of each month and were times for special sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). Appointed feasts, such as Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, were times of communal gathering and celebration, each with its own historical and theological significance (Leviticus 23). These observances pointed to the rhythm of worship and the anticipation of the Messiah, who fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>they were to serve regularly before the LORD</b><br>The Levites were tasked with serving regularly before the LORD, maintaining the temple and facilitating worship. This service was a perpetual reminder of God's presence among His people and their need for continual devotion. The regularity of their service underscores the importance of consistent worship and dedication to God, a principle echoed in the New Testament call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>in the numbers prescribed for them</b><br>The numbers prescribed for the Levites' service were detailed in the Mosaic Law, ensuring order and reverence in worship (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). This organization reflects God's desire for structure and holiness in worship, as well as the importance of each individual's role in the community of faith. The precision in these instructions highlights God's sovereignty and the meticulous care with which He orchestrates His plans, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who perfectly completed the work of

to handle every sacrifice that goes up in flame, following the daily pattern laid out in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-8</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;whenever burnt offerings were presented&#8221; reminds us that worship in Israel was rhythmic and continual, not occasional. By tying the Levites&#8217; calling to each presentation, the text underscores that every sacrifice matters to God (<a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts</b><p>&#8226; Sabbaths: <a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9-10</a> describes a special two-lamb offering every seventh day. The Levites had to be ready weekly.<p>&#8226; New Moons: <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a> adds rams, bulls, grain, and drink offerings at the start of each month. This signaled fresh dedication, echoed later in <a href="/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a> where &#8220;from New Moon to another&#8221; all flesh will come to worship.<p>&#8226; Appointed feasts: <a href="/bsb/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a> lists Passover, Weeks, Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Tabernacles. Each feast carried distinct offerings (<a href="/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16-31</a>; 29:1-39). The Levites&#8217; role covered them all, showing that every season of national life was framed by sacrificial worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were to serve regularly before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Serve&#8221; stresses priestly ministry, not casual duty (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Regularly&#8221; translates into a lifelong vocation. David organizes 24 Levitical divisions in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1-19</a> so the temple never lacks ministers.<p>&#8226; Standing &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; indicates proximity to His presence in the sanctuary, a privilege later fulfilled perfectly by Christ our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the numbers prescribed for them</b><p>&#8226; God gave exact quantities for each offering&#8212;bulls, rams, lambs, and grain measures (<a href="/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-34</a>). The Levites could not improvise.<p>&#8226; This precision teaches that the Lord cares about both heart and obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s detailed census of Levites earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3-5</a>) matches God&#8217;s detailed sacrificial counts, linking willing servants to well-defined tasks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a> shows David ensuring that worship at the future temple would be constant, orderly, and comprehensive. Every time a burnt offering went up&#8212;weekly Sabbaths, monthly New Moons, yearly feasts&#8212;Levites were on duty, following God&#8217;s exact instructions. The verse highlights continuous devotion, reverent obedience, and a divinely structured ministry that points ahead to the unceasing, perfect intercession of Jesus Christ for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">And to offer all burnt sacrifices.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And</span> <span class= "ital">over all offering of burnt offerings.</span> The Levites had to select and prepare the victims, the priests offered them, when ready, upon the altar.
