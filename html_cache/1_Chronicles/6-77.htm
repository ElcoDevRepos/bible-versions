The Levites were set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle, and later the temple. The Merarites specifically were responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle's structural components, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This allocation of cities to the Merarites reflects the fulfillment of God's command to provide for the Levites, who did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>).<p><b>From the tribe of Zebulun they were given Rimmono and Tabor,</b><br>The tribe of Zebulun was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's tenth son. Zebulun's territory was located in the northern part of Israel, which was fertile and strategically positioned for trade. Rimmono, also known as Rimmon, is a location that is not extensively detailed in biblical records, but it is understood to be within Zebulun's territory. Tabor is more significant, as it is associated with Mount Tabor, a prominent hill in the region. Mount Tabor is traditionally identified as the site of the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>), making it a place of prophetic and typological significance, pointing to the revelation of Christ's divine nature.<p><b>together with their pasturelands.</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands was essential for the Levites, as they needed resources to sustain their families and livestock. These lands provided the necessary means for the Levites to live, given that they did not have a large inheritance of land for agriculture. The provision of pasturelands underscores the practical care and provision God made for those dedicated to His service. This allocation also reflects the broader biblical principle of God's provision for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who provides for all needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_zebulun.htm">Tribe of Zebulun</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Zebulun, the sixth son of Jacob and Leah.

They stand as a reminder that every part of God&#8217;s house needs faithful, behind-the-scenes laborers (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The rest of the Levites</b><p><a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a> catalogs how each Levite family received towns instead of a tribal territory (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>). The phrase &#8220;the rest of the Levites&#8221; shows that God provided equitably for every servant family&#8212;no one was overlooked (<a href="/joshua/21-3.htm">Joshua 21:3, 8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Received the following</b><p>Receiving towns was not a human negotiation but a divine allotment confirmed by lot (<a href="/joshua/21-8.htm">Joshua 21:8</a>). The wording underscores that the Levites&#8217; inheritance came directly from the Lord&#8217;s hand; their security rested on His promise, not land size (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the tribe of Zebulun</b><p>Zebulun&#8217;s territory lay in the fertile north (<a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>).

Housing Merarites in a place of fruitfulness pictures God planting His servants where they can refresh others (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tabor</b><p>Not Mount Tabor itself but a town nearby (<a href="/joshua/19-22.htm">Joshua 19:22</a>). Mount Tabor later became a rally point for Barak and Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>).
