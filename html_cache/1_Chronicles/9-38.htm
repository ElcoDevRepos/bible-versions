The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the continuity and legitimacy of the Israelite tribes after the Babylonian exile. Mikloth's mention here highlights the importance of family lineage and heritage in maintaining tribal identity. The name "Mikloth" means "staves" or "rods," which could symbolize leadership or authority, a fitting connection given the royal lineage of Saul. Shimeam, his son, is less known, but his inclusion underscores the chronicler's intent to preserve the memory of even lesser-known family members, emphasizing the value of each individual in God's plan.<p><b>They too lived alongside their relatives in Jerusalem.</b><br>The phrase indicates the return and settlement of the Benjaminites in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel, was significant for the restoration of the Jewish community. Living "alongside their relatives" suggests a close-knit community, essential for rebuilding the nation and maintaining cultural and religious practices. This settlement reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to restore His people to their land, as prophesied in books like Jeremiah and Isaiah. The return to Jerusalem also prefigures the ultimate gathering of God's people, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the establishment of the Church and the future hope of the New Jerusalem in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mikloth.htm">Mikloth</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Mikloth is mentioned as the father of Shimeam.
