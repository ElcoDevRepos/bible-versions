This inquiry reflects a pattern seen in <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>, where David consistently seeks God's direction before making strategic decisions. It underscores the importance of prayer and seeking God's will in all matters, a principle that is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>who answered him</b><br>God's response to David's inquiry highlights the personal relationship between God and David. This interaction is reminiscent of God's communication with other biblical figures such as Moses and Joshua, where God provides direct guidance. It emphasizes the belief that God is actively involved in the lives of His people and is willing to provide direction when sought earnestly.<p><b>&#8220;Do not march up after them</b><br>God's instruction to David not to pursue the Philistines directly suggests a strategic approach to warfare that relies on divine insight rather than conventional military tactics. This directive is similar to God's guidance in other battles, such as the unconventional strategy given to Joshua at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>). It illustrates the principle that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>but circle around them</b><br>The command to circle around the enemy indicates a tactical maneuver that would catch the Philistines off guard. This strategy reflects the wisdom of God in providing a plan that ensures victory while minimizing risk. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's instructions, even when they may seem unconventional.<p><b>and attack them in front of the balsam trees</b><br>The mention of balsam trees provides a geographical marker that situates the event in a specific location, likely in the Valley of Rephaim, known for its balsam groves. This detail not only adds historical authenticity but also connects to the broader biblical narrative where specific locations often hold spiritual significance. The balsam trees may symbolize a place of divine intervention, similar to other significant locations in Israel's history, such as the oak of Moreh (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) or the terebinth tree in Ophrah (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his military prowess.

The second half must be adjusted by comparison with the older text, which reads, "Thou must not go up [LXX., "to meet them "]; go round to their rear, and come upon them in front of the <span class= "ital">baca</span> trees." Probably the terms rendered "after them" and "from them" should be slightly modified and transposed in our text. This will give, "<span class= "ital">Go</span> not up against them; go round to their rear," &c., as in Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">Mulberry trees.</span>--The traditional Jewish rendering of <span class= "ital">beka'im,</span> a Hebrew word only occurring here and in the parallel passage of Samuel. Probably the kind of balsam tree called <span class= "ital">b?k?</span> by the Arabs is meant. It sheds a gum like tears, whence its name. (Heb., <span class= "ital">b?k?,</span> "to weep.") (Comp. <a href="/psalms/84-6.htm" title="Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.">Psalm 84:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees</span>. The meaning of the directions as here given is sufficiently evident, yet it is somewhat more forcibly expressed in the parallel place, "Thou shalt not go up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "against the Philistines" (see our tenth verse, and note the form of David's inquiry); "<span class="accented">but</span> <span class="accented">fetch a compass behind them."</span> The mulberry trees were evidently behind the Philistines. The Hebrew word for the trees here spoken of is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and the correct rendering of it is probably neither "mulberry" nor, as the Septuagint and Vulgate translate, "pear" trees. But judging from the probable derivation (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to weep), they were trees of the balsam species, and it seems that this is as far as we can safely conjecture. One of the latest authorities (see Condor's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 398, 2nd edit.) pronounces it an "unknown species." The tree, strange to say, is only mentioned here and in the parallel place. A summary of opinions as to the tree intended may be found in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:439, and this is just sufficient to show that it is not as yet identified with any semblance of certainty. However, it is easy to understand hew the balsam species, from which the exuding gum resembles "tears," might come by the name set forth in the present Hebrew root. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/14-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inquired</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#8217;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
