This allegiance made it significant that Benjamites were now coming to support David, indicating a shift in loyalty and recognition of David's anointed kingship. The tribe of Judah, David's own tribe, naturally supported him, but the inclusion of Benjamites highlights the growing acceptance of David's rule across tribal lines. This foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David's leadership. The mention of both tribes also reflects the broader theme of reconciliation and unity among the tribes of Israel, which is a recurring theme in the narrative of David's rise to power.<p><b>also came to David</b><br>David's gathering of support from various tribes and groups is a testament to his leadership and the fulfillment of God's promise to him. This movement towards David can be seen as a divine orchestration, as God had chosen David to be king over Israel. The coming of these men signifies the recognition of David's legitimacy and God's favor upon him. This gathering of support is reminiscent of the gathering of the nations to Christ, as people from all backgrounds come to acknowledge His lordship.<p><b>in his stronghold</b><br>David's stronghold is traditionally identified as the cave of Adullam or the fortress of Ziklag, places where David sought refuge while fleeing from Saul. These locations were strategically chosen for their defensibility and seclusion. The stronghold symbolizes a place of safety and divine protection, where David could consolidate his forces and plan his next moves. It also serves as a type of Christ, who is often referred to as a refuge and fortress for believers. The stronghold represents God's provision and protection for His anointed, even in times of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who at this time was not yet reigning over all of Israel.
