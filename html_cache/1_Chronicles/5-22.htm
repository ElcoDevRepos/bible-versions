The context of <a href="/1_chronicles/5.htm">1 Chronicles 5</a> involves the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who were settled on the east side of the Jordan River. These tribes were often in conflict with neighboring peoples. The phrase "many others fell slain" underscores the scale of the victory, suggesting divine intervention and favor. This mirrors other biblical battles where God grants victory to His people, such as in the battles led by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>) and Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p><b>because the battle belonged to God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the theological perspective that God is the ultimate source of victory. It reflects the belief that success in battle is not due to human strength or strategy but to divine will. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, where David declares that "the battle is the Lord's" before defeating Goliath. It highlights the sovereignty of God over the affairs of nations and His ability to deliver His people. This idea is central to the faith of Israel and serves as a reminder of reliance on God rather than human might.<p><b>And they occupied the land until the exile</b><br>This phrase refers to the period of occupation by the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Their settlement in the Transjordan region was initially granted by Moses (Numbers 32) and confirmed by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8-13</a>). The "exile" mentioned here refers to the Assyrian captivity, which occurred in 722 BC when the northern kingdom of Israel was conquered and its people were deported (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). This historical event marked the end of their occupation of the land. The phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God, as the exile was a result of Israel's persistent idolatry and sin. It also foreshadows the ultimate exile and restoration themes found throughout the prophetic books, pointing to the hope of redemption and return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These tribes were involved in the battle described in this passage.

In context, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had gone to war against the Hagrites and their allies (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18-21</a>). Scripture notes their enemy &#8220;was delivered into their hand, for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered their plea because they trusted in Him&#8221; (v. 20).<p>&#8226; The verse does not minimize casualties; it stresses reality.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people were outnumbered (v. 18 lists 44,760 warriors), yet &#8220;many&#8221; on the opposing side fell.<p>&#8226; Similar Old Testament battles&#8212;Joshua at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-24.htm">Joshua 8:24-25</a>) or Gideon&#8217;s victory over the Midianites (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>)&#8212;show that when God fights for His people, opposing forces suffer decisive defeat.<p>Cross references underscore the principle: &#8220;For the LORD your God is He who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>); &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the Battle Belonged to God</b><p>The heart of the verse explains the outcome: &#8220;because the battle belonged to God.&#8221; This short clause highlights divine ownership and initiative.<p>&#8226; God is not a distant spectator; He takes charge of conflicts that involve His covenant people. See <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>&#8212;David tells Goliath, &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221;; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>&#8212;Jahaziel tells King Jehoshaphat, &#8220;the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Dependence is key. Verse 20 records that the Israelite warriors &#8220;cried out to God,&#8221; and &#8220;He answered their plea.&#8221; Their victory flowed from reliance, not merely strategy or strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p>&#8226; When God claims ownership of a battle, the result is certain. <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a> describes Him as &#8220;a mighty warrior&#8221; who &#8220;stirs up His zeal.&#8221; That assurance encourages believers to trust God in spiritual warfare today (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They Occupied the Land Until the Exile</b><p>The closing line says, &#8220;And they occupied the land until the exile.&#8221; God&#8217;s victory provided immediate blessing&#8212;territory to settle&#8212;but also hinted at future accountability.<p>&#8226; The land east of the Jordan, once held by the Hagrites, became Israelite pasture and home (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33-42</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Until the exile&#8221; points to the Assyrian deportation in 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). God granted the land, yet later removed His people when they persisted in sin (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement balances triumph with warning. Possession is conditional on ongoing faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15, 63</a>-64).<p>&#8226; For believers today, victories entrusted by God&#8212;whether opportunities, ministries, or resources&#8212;must be stewarded faithfully, remembering that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/5-22.htm">1 Chronicles 5:22</a> describes a decisive victory where many enemies were slain &#8220;because the battle belonged to God,&#8221;
