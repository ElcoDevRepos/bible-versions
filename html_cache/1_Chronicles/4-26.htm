The tribe of Simeon is often associated with the southern part of the land of Canaan, particularly within the territory of Judah. This genealogical listing emphasizes the continuity and preservation of the Simeonite lineage. The mention of Mishma and his sons highlights the importance of family and tribal connections in ancient Israelite society, where lineage determined one's role and inheritance within the community.<p><b>Hammuel,</b><br>Hammuel is a relatively obscure figure in the Bible, with little additional information provided about him outside of this genealogical record. His name, which can mean "heat of God" or "wrath of God," reflects the common practice of embedding theological significance within personal names. This practice underscores the belief in divine involvement in the lives of individuals and families. The inclusion of Hammuel in the genealogy serves to preserve his memory and maintain the integrity of the tribal records.<p><b>Zaccur,</b><br>Zaccur, another son of Mishma, shares a name with several other biblical figures, indicating that it was a common name in ancient Israel. The name Zaccur means "mindful" or "remembrance," suggesting a cultural emphasis on memory and the importance of being remembered by God and one's community. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of remembrance, as seen in various Psalms and prophetic writings, where God is often called upon to remember His covenant with His people.<p><b>and Shimei.</b><br>Shimei is a name that appears multiple times in the Old Testament, associated with different individuals. The name means "heard" or "hearing," which may imply a connection to the idea of being heard by God or being attentive to His word. In the context of genealogies, the mention of Shimei serves to complete the record of Mishma's descendants, ensuring that each branch of the family is acknowledged. This reflects the biblical emphasis on the value of each individual within the community of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mishma.htm">Mishma</a></b><br>A descendant of Simeon, Mishma is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Simeon.

Scripture often gives primacy of place to the first-named son (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Firstborn status brought both privilege and accountability (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). Hammuel&#8217;s inclusion underscores that leadership within God&#8217;s people is meant for service, not self-promotion (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43&#8211;45</a>).<p>&#8226; God notices every leader who walks faithfully, even if history records only a name (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zaccur</b><p>&#8226; Zaccur&#8217;s placement between brothers shows that middle positions matter to God. He &#8220;is no respecter of persons&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds readers that significance is measured not by volume of information but by being counted among God&#8217;s covenant people (<a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; In later Scriptures, men named Zaccur help repair Jerusalem&#8217;s wall (<a href="/nehemiah/3-2.htm">Nehemiah 3:2</a>). Whether this is the same man or a descendant, the name surfaces again, illustrating generational faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Shimei</b><p>&#8226; Shimei comes last, but Scripture often elevates the last-named (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Other Shimeis in Scripture reveal varied legacies&#8212;one cursed David (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5&#8211;13</a>), another stood faithfully with Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>). Our name may be shared, yet each of us chooses our own obedience (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Shimei&#8217;s inclusion assures the quiet, lesser-known believer that God numbers every child in His family (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/4-26.htm">1 Chronicles 4:26</a>, though brief, proclaims God&#8217;s meticulous care over every lineage.
