This division occurred because Manasseh was one of the two sons of Joseph, who received a double portion of inheritance, effectively making him a tribe in his own right. The mention of their numerous population highlights the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where he prophesied that Manasseh would become a great people. This growth in numbers also reflects God's promise to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p><b>They settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon</b><br>Bashan was a fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its rich pastures and strong cattle (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). It was conquered by the Israelites under Moses' leadership (<a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a>). The settlement of the half-tribe of Manasseh in this area indicates their role in securing and maintaining the eastern territories of Israel. Baal-hermon, on the other hand, is a location associated with Mount Hermon, a significant mountain range marking the northern boundary of Israel. The name "Baal" suggests the presence of Canaanite religious practices, which the Israelites were commanded to avoid (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>(that is, Senir, also known as Mount Hermon).</b><br>Senir is another name for Mount Hermon, as mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>. Mount Hermon is a prominent geographical feature in the region, often associated with the northernmost boundary of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>). It is a place of significant biblical events, including the possible site of the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>), symbolizing the revelation of Christ's divine glory.

Though Manasseh was the elder, Jacob gave the chief blessing (<a href="/genesis/48-10.htm">Genesis 48:10-22</a>) to Ephraim.

It is probable that the division of the tribe was determined partly according to the energy of those who composed it at the time of division - the more warlike being more adapted to the east of Jordan. Nevertheless Machir is distinctly mentioned westward, as well as with Gilead eastward (comp. <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14-17</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). (For the further prosecution of this part of the subject, see Exposition, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal-hermon</span>, etc. These three names need scarcely be read as different names for exactly the same region, but as designating different sides or heights of what was essentially one and the same well-known mountain district, with which would agree Psalm 43:6, "Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and <span class="accented">of the Hermonites</span>, from the hill Mizar.' So <a href="/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-10</a> tells us that Hermon was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> by the Sidonians; Shenir, <span class="accented">i.q. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Senir</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, exactly the same word in the Hebrew text in all the four places of its occurrence - <a href="/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>), by the Amorites. And the suggestion of Grove is likely enough, that <span class="accented">Baal-hermon</span> was the Phoenician cast of the name. If any point were to be gained by reading the names, however, as intended to cover exactly the same tract, it may be noted <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Hebrew conjunction will perfectly admit of being translated "even;" and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the <span class="accented">order</span> of the names, going from the foreign to the native <span class="cmt_word">Hermon</span> itself, would so far favour it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
