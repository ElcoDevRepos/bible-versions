This connection is suggested by their name and their association with Ishmaelite tribes. The conflict with the Hagrites reflects ongoing tensions between the Israelites and surrounding peoples. The Hagrites are mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6</a>, where they are listed among the enemies of Israel. This war indicates the Israelites' efforts to secure their territory and maintain their identity amidst external threats.<p><b>as well as Jetur</b><br>Jetur is one of the sons of Ishmael, as listed in <a href="/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>. The mention of Jetur here likely refers to the descendants of this Ishmaelite tribe. The Ishmaelites were known for their nomadic lifestyle and were often in conflict with settled peoples like the Israelites. The inclusion of Jetur in this passage highlights the broader conflict between the Israelites and the descendants of Ishmael, which has its roots in the familial tensions between Isaac and Ishmael.<p><b>Naphish</b><br>Naphish is another son of Ishmael, also mentioned in <a href="/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>. Like Jetur, the Naphishites were part of the larger Ishmaelite confederation. The presence of Naphish in this list underscores the persistent enmity between the Israelites and the Ishmaelites. This conflict can be seen as a continuation of the ancient rivalry between the descendants of Isaac and Ishmael, which began with their respective mothers, Sarah and Hagar.<p><b>and Nodab</b><br>Nodab is less well-known, with limited biblical references. The mention of Nodab alongside the Hagrites, Jetur, and Naphish suggests that they were another group allied against Israel. The inclusion of Nodab in this passage indicates the diverse coalition of tribes that opposed the Israelites. This reflects the broader theme of Israel's struggle to maintain its covenantal identity and land amidst surrounding hostile nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These tribes of Israel were settled on the east side of the Jordan River.

He answered their prayers, because they trusted in Him&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-20.htm">1 Chronicles 5:20</a>). Their victory was God-given, not merely human strategy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the Hagrites</b><p>&#8226; The Hagrites were descendants of Hagar; they lived east of the Jordan in the Arabian desert regions (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, these same Israelite tribes had already subdued Hagrite territory, enlarging their own grazing lands. This second conflict shows ongoing tension on the frontier&#8212;historic, literal clashes, not myth or allegory.<p>&#8226; The Hagrites&#8217; continual opposition illustrates the enduring struggle between the line of promise (Isaac/Israel) and the line that arose through Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as Jetur</b><p>&#8226; Jetur is listed among Ishmael&#8217;s twelve sons (<a href="/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>). His clan, too, inhabited the desert lands south-east of Gilead.<p>&#8226; By naming Jetur separately, the chronicler highlights multiple distinct but allied tribes joining forces against Israel&#8212;an echo of other coalitions, such as the five Amorite kings in <a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant people often faced numerically superior foes, yet victories came through dependence on Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Naphish</b><p>&#8226; Naphish is another Ishmaelite clan (<a href="/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>). The inclusion shows how far Ishmael&#8217;s descendants had spread and how their interests occasionally collided with Israel&#8217;s pastoral needs.<p>&#8226; For the eastern tribes, controlling pastureland was essential; conflicts over grazing recur in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>; 26:20).<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s matter-of-fact record underscores the reliability of biblical history&#8212;specific names, real people, verifiable lineage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Nodab</b><p>&#8226; Nodab is mentioned only here, suggesting either a smaller Ishmaelite subgroup or a regional ally. The scarcity of extra-biblical information does not diminish the factual nature of the text; it merely reminds us that Scripture preserves details other sources have lost.<p>&#8226; God knows every nation and clan (<a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>); even little-known peoples fit into His overarching plan.<p>&#8226; Linking Nodab with better-known tribes signals a united front against Israel&#8212;yet all were decisively overcome (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-22.htm">1 Chronicles 5:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/5-19.htm">1 Chronicles 5:19</a> records a historical battle in which the eastern tribes of Israel launched a God-sanctioned campaign against the Hagrites and three allied Ishmaelite clans&#8212;Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. The verse, set between descriptions of the troops&#8217; strength (v. 18) and God&#8217;s decisive help (v. 20), highlights:<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s readiness to defend their God-given inheritance.<p>&#8226; The persistence of Ishmaelite opposition on Israel&#8217;s eastern border.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to grant victory when His people trust Him.<p>Taken literally, the text assures us that every detail of Scripture&#8212;names, places, outcomes&#8212;stands firm, inviting today&#8217;s believers to the same trust in the God who fights for His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The name of <span class="cmt_word">Nodab</span> we have not elsewhere; but those of <span class="cmt_word">Jetur</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Nephish</span> are names from the very origin of the tribe of Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-29.htm">1 Chronicles 1:29-31</a>). It would be possible to consider them here as <span class="accented">in apposition</span> with the description, <span class="cmt_word">the Hagarites</span> (respecting whom see note on ver. 10); but they may more probably be regarded as favourite names, still repeated in the descendants of the tribe. The people of Nephish have not made their mark deep on the page of ethnographic history; but the people of Jetur have done so. Their stinted territory appears in the name Ituraea (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>). Their people reappear also (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13. e. 11, &sect; 3; Strabo, 16:518, 520). Nor is it an unnoticeable contribution to the truth of our history here to put, side by side with the description of the qualities and of the arms and weapons of warfare of the Manassites and their helpers of Reuben and Gad (ver. 18), those of the Ituraeans, their antagonists (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:448; Cicero, 'Philippians,' 2:44; Luean, 'Pharsalia,' 7:230; see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:905). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They waged</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
