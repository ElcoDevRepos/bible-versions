After receiving a divine command through the prophet Gad, David acts promptly. This reflects his heart of repentance and submission to God's will, especially after the sin of conducting a census. The act of "going up" often signifies moving towards a place of worship or sacrifice, indicating David's intention to make amends with God.<p><b>at the word that Gad had spoken</b><br>Gad, known as David's seer, plays a crucial role as a mediator of God's message. Prophets in Israel were God's mouthpieces, and their words carried divine authority. This emphasizes the importance of prophetic guidance in the Old Testament, where God communicated His will through chosen individuals. Gad's message was not merely advice but a directive from God Himself.<p><b>in the name of the LORD</b><br>The phrase underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. Acting "in the name of the LORD" implies that the instructions were not Gad's own but were delivered with the full backing and authority of God. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God's name signifies His presence, power, and promise. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of acting in Jesus' name, which carries similar authority and divine endorsement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God, but also for his human failings.
