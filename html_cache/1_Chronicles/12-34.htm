This tribe was allocated land in the northern part of Israel, near the Sea of Galilee. The region was known for its fertile land and strategic location, which often made it a target for invaders. In biblical history, Naphtali is noted for its warriors and its role in various battles, including those led by Barak and Deborah in the Book of Judges.<p><b>1,000 commanders:</b><br>The mention of 1,000 commanders indicates a well-organized military structure within the tribe of Naphtali. This reflects the tribe's readiness and ability to mobilize a significant force. In ancient Israel, military leaders were often chosen for their experience, wisdom, and ability to lead men in battle. The large number of commanders suggests a substantial population and a strong commitment to the cause of supporting David as king.<p><b>Accompanied by 37,000 men:</b><br>The large number of men accompanying the commanders highlights the tribe's strength and willingness to support David. This substantial force demonstrates the unity and loyalty of the tribe of Naphtali to the anointed king. In the context of 1 Chronicles, these men were part of the larger assembly of Israelite warriors who came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel, fulfilling God's promise to David.<p><b>With shield and spear:</b><br>The mention of shield and spear indicates that these men were well-armed and prepared for battle. The shield was a common defensive weapon in ancient warfare, providing protection against arrows and other projectiles, while the spear was a versatile offensive weapon. This phrase underscores the readiness and capability of Naphtali's warriors, emphasizing their preparedness to defend and support David's kingship. The imagery of shield and spear also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a shield and protector for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and Bilhah.
