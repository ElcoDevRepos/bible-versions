This phrase highlights their unique role in handling sacred objects. The ark of God, representing God's presence, was to be carried on their shoulders, signifying the weight and responsibility of bearing God's holiness. This method of transport was prescribed to ensure reverence and to prevent direct contact with the ark, which was considered holy. The use of shoulders indicates a personal and communal responsibility, as the Levites were to bear the ark together, symbolizing unity in service.<p><b>with the poles</b><br>The poles were a practical and symbolic element in the transportation of the ark. Made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, they were inserted into rings on the sides of the ark, allowing it to be carried without being touched. This design was given by God to Moses and is detailed in <a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13-15</a>. The poles being permanently attached to the ark (<a href="/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a>) ensured that the ark was always ready to be moved according to God's direction, emphasizing the readiness and mobility of God's presence with His people.<p><b>as Moses had commanded</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions as given through Moses. The command to carry the ark in this specific manner was part of the law given at Sinai, reflecting the broader principle of adherence to divine commandments. Moses, as the mediator of the covenant, provided the Israelites with God's laws, and following these commands was crucial for maintaining a right relationship with God. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, where blessings are often contingent upon adherence to God's laws.<p><b>in accordance with the word of the LORD</b><br>The phrase emphasizes that the instructions for carrying the ark were not merely human traditions but were divinely ordained. The "word of the LORD" refers to God's direct revelation and commands, which were to be followed precisely. This highlights the authority of God's word and the necessity of aligning actions with divine will. It also points to the broader biblical theme of God's word as a guiding and authoritative force in the lives of His people. The adherence to God's word in this context serves as a model for faithfulness and reverence in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties, particularly in the service of the tabernacle and later the temple.

Only Levites could handle the holy things, underscoring that ministry is a calling, not a volunteer hobby. Like them, believers today are &#8220;a royal priesthood&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), invited&#8212;but not entitled&#8212;to draw near.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>carried the ark of God</b><p>The ark was the earthly throne of the invisible King (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>).
