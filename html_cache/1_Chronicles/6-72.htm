This tribe was known for its agricultural prowess and wisdom, as suggested in <a href="/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>, where Issachar is described as a strong donkey lying down between two burdens. The tribe's territory was located in the fertile Jezreel Valley, which was conducive to farming and trade. Issachar's role in providing cities for the Levites highlights the interconnectedness of the tribes and the importance of supporting the priestly class in Israelite society.<p><b>they were given Kedesh</b><br>Kedesh, meaning "holy" or "sacred," was a city allocated to the Levites. It is distinct from Kedesh in Naphtali, a city of refuge. This Kedesh was located in the territory of Issachar, emphasizing the distribution of Levitical cities across various tribal lands to ensure the Levites' presence and influence throughout Israel. The allocation of cities like Kedesh to the Levites fulfilled God's command in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, where the Levites were to be given cities to dwell in, along with surrounding pasturelands.<p><b>Daberath</b><br>Daberath, also known as Daberah, was another city given to the Levites. It was situated near Mount Tabor, a significant geographical landmark in the region. The city's location near Tabor, a site of military and spiritual importance, underscores the strategic placement of Levitical cities. Daberath's inclusion in the Levitical cities reflects the broader theme of God's provision for the Levites, ensuring they had places to live and serve throughout the land of Israel. This allocation also highlights the Levites' role in teaching and maintaining the spiritual health of the nation, as they were dispersed among the tribes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_issachar.htm">Tribe of Issachar</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for their understanding of the times and wisdom in decision-making.
