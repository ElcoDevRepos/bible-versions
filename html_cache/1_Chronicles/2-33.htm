The name Jonathan means "Yahweh has given," which reflects the common practice of naming children with theophoric elements, indicating a connection to God. This Jonathan is distinct from the more well-known Jonathan, the son of King Saul and friend of David. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the lineage and tribal affiliations of the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of heritage and God's promises to His people.<p><b>Peleth and Zaza:</b><br>Peleth and Zaza are relatively obscure figures in the biblical narrative, mentioned only in this genealogical context. Their inclusion highlights the comprehensive nature of the genealogies, which aim to preserve the record of even lesser-known family lines. The name Peleth means "swiftness" or "flight," while Zaza means "belonging to all" or "plenty." These names may reflect characteristics or hopes associated with these individuals or their family line. The genealogical records in Chronicles often serve to affirm the fulfillment of God's promises to the tribes of Israel, ensuring that each family is accounted for in the history of God's people.<p><b>These were the descendants of Jerahmeel:</b><br>Jerahmeel was a descendant of Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah, and his lineage is detailed in <a href="/1_chronicles/2.htm">1 Chronicles 2</a>. The Jerahmeelites were a clan within the tribe of Judah, and their mention underscores the chronicler's intent to document the full breadth of Judah's descendants. This focus on Judah is significant, as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come, fulfilling the messianic prophecies. The genealogies in Chronicles not only preserve historical records but also point to the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through the line of Judah, culminating in the birth of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>A descendant of Jerahmeel, part of the tribe of Judah.

Just as earlier verses note that &#8220;Hezron became the father of Jerahmeel&#8221; (1 Chron 2:9, 25), the text now zooms in on Jonathan, a great-grandson of Hezron.<p>&#8226; Genealogies in Scripture are not filler; they verify God&#8217;s faithfulness in preserving His covenant people (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>). Every name is evidence that the Lord kept His promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross-reference: <a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a> shows another occasion where God stirs a leader to &#8220;assemble the nobles&#8230; in order to register them by genealogy,&#8221; underscoring the importance of precise lineage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Peleth and Zaza</b><p>&#8220; Peleth and Zaza. &#8221;<p>&#8226; Two sons are listed, reminding us that God tracks individuals, not just tribes (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Scripture records nothing else about Peleth and Zaza, their inclusion affirms that every person in the covenant family matters to God.<p>&#8226; Similar one-verse mentions appear elsewhere (e.g., 1 Chron 4:10 with Jabez), encouraging readers that obscurity before men never means insignificance before the Lord (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their placement in the line of Judah ties them, however distantly, to the promise that &#8220;the scepter will not depart from Judah&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>) and ultimately to the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3, 16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These were the descendants of Jerahmeel</b><p>&#8220; These were the descendants of Jerahmeel. &#8221;<p>&#8226; The chronicler circles back to Jerahmeel, first-born of Hezron (1 Chron 2:25), to close this brief branch of the family tree. The phrase anchors Peleth and Zaza firmly within Judah&#8217;s heritage.<p>&#8226; By confirming this lineage, Scripture reinforces the legal and tribal records that safeguarded land rights (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>) and temple service assignments (1 Chron 24:4).<p>&#8226; The verse also illustrates how God weaves multiple family threads into His redemptive tapestry; even lesser-known lines contribute to the history that culminates in Christ (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-33.htm">1 Chronicles 2:33</a> may seem like a simple roll call, yet it testifies to God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness. By naming Jonathan&#8217;s two sons and tying them back to Jerahmeel, the Holy Spirit affirms that every generation, every household, and every individual in Judah&#8217;s line is known, remembered, and woven into the larger story leading to the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">These were the sons of Jerahmeel.</span>--Subscription of the list contained in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-25.htm" title="And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.">1Chronicles 2:25-33</a>.
