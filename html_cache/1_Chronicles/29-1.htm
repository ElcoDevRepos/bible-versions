This assembly includes tribal leaders, military commanders, and other officials. David's public declaration underscores the importance of transparency and unity in leadership transitions. It reflects the biblical principle of communal involvement in significant national and spiritual decisions, as seen in other instances like Moses addressing Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/31.htm">Deuteronomy 31:1-8</a>).<p><b>My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen</b><br>Solomon's selection as king is divinely ordained, emphasizing God's sovereignty in leadership appointments.

Solomon's anointing fulfills God's promise to David that his lineage would continue on the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).

The temple would become the central place of worship for Israel, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This task's greatness is not only in its physical construction but also in its role in Israel's covenant relationship with God.<p><b>because this palace is not for man, but for the LORD God</b><br>The temple, referred to as a palace, signifies a dwelling place for God, distinct from human palaces. This distinction underscores the temple's sacredness and the holiness required in its construction and use. It reflects the biblical theme of God's transcendence and immanence, as He dwells among His people yet remains wholly other (<a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>).

It usually means the palace at Susa (comp. the Persian word <span class= "ital">baru,</span> "citadel"), and this is the only passage of Scripture in which it denotes the Temple. From its august associations, the word was well calculated to convey to the minds of the chronicler's contemporaries some idea of the magnificence of the Temple of Solomon as he imagined it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The anxiety which David felt on account of the youth of Solomon (repeated from <a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>) evidently pressed heavily on him. The additional expression here is to be noticed, <span class="cmt_word">whom alone God hath chosen</span>. By this plea, full of truth as it was, we may suppose that David would shelter himself from any possible blame or reflection on the part of the people, from the charge of partiality on the part of his elder children, and any unjust slight to them, and also from any <span class="accented">self-reproach</span>, in that he was devolving such a responsible task on so <span class="cmt_word">young and tender</span> a man. <span class="cmt_word">Palace</span>.

It is found in <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; in <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>; but very frequently in Esther, where it is used not only of "Shushan the palace" (<a href="/esther/1-2.htm">Esther 1:2</a>; <a href="/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a>; <a href="/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>), as the royal abode, but also of the special part of the city adjoining the palace proper (<a href="/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>; <a href="/esther/2-5.htm">Esther 2:5</a>; <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>; <a href="/esther/9-6.htm">Esther 9:6</a>). The word is found also in <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; but there it carries the signification of the fortress of the temple. There may be some special appropriateness in its use here, in consideration of the circumstance of the fortifications and wall, which flanked the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
