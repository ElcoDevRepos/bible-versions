The fortress, known as the stronghold of Zion, was a strategic military location that David captured from the Jebusites (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). This act symbolized the unification of the tribes of Israel under David's rule. The fortress provided a defensible position, crucial for establishing a secure capital. This move also fulfilled God's promise to David of establishing his kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). The fortress represents a type of Christ as a stronghold and refuge for believers (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>that is why it was called the City of David.</b><br>The naming of the fortress as the City of David signifies David's establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. This city would later become the site of Solomon's Temple, central to Jewish worship. The City of David is a term that underscores David's legacy and God's covenant with him, promising that his lineage would endure forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). Jerusalem's significance is further highlighted in prophecy, as it is often associated with the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The City of David serves as a foreshadowing of the New Jerusalem, where Christ will reign eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is anointed king over Israel and establishes his rule by taking up residence in the fortress, which becomes known as the City of David.

Compare Joshua leading Israel into the land (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43&#8211;45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the fortress</b><p>- The &#8220;fortress&#8221; refers to Zion, a natural stronghold towering above the Kidron Valley; its steep slopes made it nearly impregnable (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>).<p>- By settling there, David demonstrates that security flows from God, not just geography. <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> echoes this: &#8220;The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.&#8221;<p>- Practical implications:<p>&#8226; God often positions His people in places that seem impossible to claim.<p>&#8226; When God gives the victory, His people live there in peace (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that is why</b><p>- Scripture often pauses to explain divine logic (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1&#8211;3</a>).
