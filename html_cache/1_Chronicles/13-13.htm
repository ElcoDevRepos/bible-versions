The ark, representing God's presence, was central to Israel's worship and identity. David's initial attempt to transport the ark resulted in the death of Uzzah (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9-10</a>), highlighting the need for proper reverence and adherence to God's instructions. The City of David, Jerusalem, was to be the political and spiritual center of Israel, and David's desire to bring the ark there underscores his intention to unify the nation under God's rule. This pause also reflects David's humility and willingness to seek God's guidance.<p><b>instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</b><br>Obed-edom, identified as a Gittite, suggests he was from Gath, a Philistine city, or possibly a Levite from the Levitical city of Gath-rimmon. His house became a temporary resting place for the ark, and during its stay, God blessed Obed-edom and his household (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>). This blessing signifies God's favor and presence, regardless of location, and foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan. The ark's stay at Obed-edom's house also emphasizes the importance of proper respect and care for sacred objects, as well as the blessings that come from hosting God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, the City of David, as a central place of worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed-edom_the_gittite.htm">Obed-edom the Gittite</a></b><br>A Levite who lived in Gath and was entrusted with the Ark of the Covenant after the incident with Uzzah.

But the difficulty occurs that an expression in this last quotation seems to identify him with the Obed-edom of <a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>; and the last sentence of our next verse. If they are one and the same, it has been suggested that marriage might account for the Merarite living in a Kohathite city (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/13-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [he]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
