This reflects the biblical theme of generational blessings and the importance of family lineage in Israelite society.<p><b>who ruled over their families</b><br>The phrase indicates a patriarchal structure where leadership and authority were vested in the male heads of families.

This echoes the qualifications for leadership seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the selection of leaders in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where men of ability, fear of God, and integrity were chosen.

Verse 6 opens by turning our attention from Obed-edom to one of his sons, Shemaiah. The simple phrase &#8220;Also to his son Shemaiah&#8221; reminds us that God tracks every generation. Scripture records these names so Israel could verify lineage and so we can see God&#8217;s faithfulness through families (compare 1 Chron 6:31-38; 15:18, 24). When the chronicler says &#8220;his son,&#8221; he treats the relationship as historical fact, rooting the account in real people and places (<a href="/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10-12</a> shows Obed-edom&#8217;s household blessed in David&#8217;s day, a blessing now continuing through Shemaiah).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were born sons</b><p>Fruitfulness is presented as God&#8217;s tangible blessing. &#8220;Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). The genealogy lists Othni, Rephael, Obed, Elzabad, and later mentions Elihu and Semachiah (1 Chron 26:7). Each boy is evidence that God kept His covenant promise to multiply the Levites so Temple service would never lack servants (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-9</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). For modern readers, this section underscores that God values family continuity and delights in raising up the next generation of faithful servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who ruled over their families</b><p>Leadership emerges early in these boys&#8217; lives. The phrase &#8220;ruled over their families&#8221; shows they were entrusted with authority, first in the household and then in the broader duties of the Temple gates (1 Chron 26:8). True biblical leadership always begins at home (<a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). The Levites&#8217; household structure mirrored God&#8217;s order: fathers and sons working side by side, with the sons stepping into responsibility as they matured. Their rule was not tyranny but stewardship&#8212;guiding relatives in worship, guarding sacred space (1 Chron 9:17-27).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they were strong, capable men</b><p>The chronicler supplies the reason for their promotion: &#8220;because they were strong, capable men.&#8221; Physical strength mattered when opening and closing massive Temple gates (1 Chron 26:12-13), yet the term also points to moral and spiritual vigor. Similar language describes David&#8217;s &#8220;mighty men&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-17</a>) and the valiant men of Benjamin who could &#8220;handle the bow&#8221; (1 Chron 8:40). God equips those He calls; human fitness joins divine commission. The sons&#8217; capability demonstrates that competence and character go hand in hand (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>). Their example urges believers today to cultivate strength&#8212;spiritually through the Word and physically as good stewards&#8212;so we can serve with excellence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-6.htm">1 Chronicles 26:6</a> highlights God&#8217;s ongoing blessing on Obed-edom&#8217;s line through Shemaiah. The birth of strong, able sons qualified them to lead both family and Temple service. The verse celebrates God-given fruitfulness, rightful household authority, and the importance of proven strength and competence in ministry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">That ruled throughout</span> <span class= "bld">the house of their</span> <span class= "bld">father.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">The lords of their clan.</span> The word translated "that ruled," is not a verb, but an abstract noun (<span class= "ital">mimsh?l</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> like our expression "the authorities," or "the government."
