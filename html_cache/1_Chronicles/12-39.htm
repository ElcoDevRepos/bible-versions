The three-day feast signifies a time of fellowship and covenant renewal, reminiscent of other significant three-day events in Scripture, such as Jonah's time in the fish or Jesus' resurrection. The act of eating and drinking together is a common biblical motif for establishing peace and agreement, as seen in <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a> when Jacob and Laban made a covenant. This gathering at Hebron, where David was anointed king over all Israel, marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, transitioning from Saul's troubled reign to David's leadership.<p><b>for their relatives had provided for them</b><br>The provision by relatives underscores the communal and familial bonds within the tribes of Israel. This act of hospitality reflects the cultural importance of kinship and support in ancient Israelite society. It also demonstrates the widespread acceptance and support for David's kingship, as the tribes willingly contributed resources. This provision can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David, as the people rally around him, similar to how the Israelites supported Moses and Joshua. The generosity of the relatives echoes the biblical principle of sharing and supporting one another, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where the early church shared everything in common.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who was gathering support from various tribes to solidify his reign.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>The city where David was anointed king over all Israel, serving as a significant location for the unification of the tribes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_tribes.htm">Israelite Tribes</a></b><br>Representatives from all the tribes of Israel who came to support David, signifying national unity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/relatives.htm">Relatives</a></b><br>The families and kin of those who gathered, who provided sustenance and support, demonstrating communal solidarity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feasting.htm">Feasting</a></b><br>The act of eating and drinking together, symbolizing celebration, unity, and the provision of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_purpose.htm">Unity in Purpose</a></b><br>The gathering at Hebron illustrates the power of unity among God's people.
