The Reubenites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and Beerah's mention highlights the continuity of tribal leadership. The name "Beerah" means "well" or "fountain," which may symbolize a source of life or sustenance, reflecting the role of leaders in providing guidance and support to their people.<p><b>whom Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria carried into exile</b><br>Tiglath-pileser III was a prominent Assyrian king who reigned from 745 to 727 BC. His military campaigns expanded the Assyrian Empire significantly, and he is known for his policy of deporting conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. The exile of Beerah signifies the beginning of the Assyrian captivity of the northern tribes of Israel, a pivotal event in biblical history. This deportation fulfilled prophecies about the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>. The exile serves as a reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God's covenant.<p><b>Beerah was a leader of the Reubenites</b><br>As a leader of the Reubenites, Beerah held a position of authority and responsibility within his tribe. The Reubenites, though initially granted land east of the Jordan River, often found themselves vulnerable to external threats due to their geographical location. Leadership in this context required not only governance but also the defense of the tribe's interests. The mention of Beerah underscores the impact of Assyrian expansion on the tribal structure of Israel, as leaders like him were removed from their positions, leading to a loss of autonomy and identity for the tribes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beerah.htm">Beerah</a></b><br>A leader of the Reubenites, one of the tribes of Israel.

Beerah stands in this family line as the last named descendant before the exile.<p>&#8226; By identifying Beerah as &#8220;his son,&#8221; the text anchors him in the historic, literal genealogy of Reuben, confirming God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve an accurate record (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>).<p>&#8226; Genealogies in Scripture serve to connect God&#8217;s promises to actual people living in real time, showing the unbroken thread from Reuben (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3&#8211;4</a>) to the moment of judgment in the Assyrian captivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria carried into exile</b><p>&#8226; Tiglath-pileser III (also called &#8220;Pul,&#8221; <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>) invaded Israel around 732 BC.
