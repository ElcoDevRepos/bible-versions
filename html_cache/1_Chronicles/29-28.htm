In the context of ancient Israel, longevity was associated with righteousness and divine approval. David's life, despite its challenges and moral failures, was marked by a deep relationship with God, as seen in the Psalms. His age at death is not specified here, but <a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a> notes that he reigned for 40 years, suggesting he lived into his seventies.<p><b>full of years, riches, and honor</b><br>David's life was characterized by abundance and respect, reflecting God's promises to him. His wealth and honor were not only personal achievements but also indicative of the prosperity and stability he brought to Israel. This fulfillment of God's covenant with David (2 Samuel 7) foreshadows the eternal kingdom established through Jesus Christ, a descendant of David. The phrase "full of years" suggests a life completed in God's purpose, paralleling the biblical theme of a life well-lived in service to God.<p><b>and his son Solomon reigned in his place</b><br>The succession of Solomon marks the continuation of the Davidic line, crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises regarding an everlasting kingdom. Solomon's reign is significant for the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for Israel. This transition of power was peaceful, unlike many ancient successions, indicating divine favor and the fulfillment of David's preparations for Solomon's rule (1 Chronicles 22). Solomon's wisdom and wealth are seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant, reigning with perfect wisdom and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, King David is described as having died at a good old age, having lived a life full of blessings, including wealth and honor.

Under his leadership, Israel experienced military victories, territorial expansion, and spiritual renewal. David's reign set the stage for the prosperity and peace that characterized Solomon's rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel and the political and spiritual center during David's reign. It is where David established his throne and where Solomon would later build the Temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the Temple is a significant part of David's legacy, as he made extensive preparations for its construction, which Solomon would complete.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessings_of_a_godly_life.htm">The Blessings of a Godly Life</a></b><br>David's life exemplifies the blessings that come from a life devoted to God.
