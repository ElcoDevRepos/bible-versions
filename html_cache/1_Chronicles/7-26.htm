By placing Ladan between Tahan (v.25) and Ammihud, Scripture underscores an unbroken line.<p>&#8226; Genealogies like this one are not filler; they show that God tracks every generation. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>, which says, &#8220;all Israel was documented in the genealogies,&#8221; highlighting God&#8217;s meticulous care.<p>&#8226; This continuity fulfills <a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>, &#8220;One generation shall declare Your works to the next,&#8221; a living chain of testimony.<p>&#8226; The setting is after the loss of several earlier sons of Ephraim (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21-22</a>). Ladan&#8217;s inclusion signals that God restored what was lost, keeping His covenant promises (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ammihud his son</b><p>&#8220;Ladan his son, Ammihud his son, Elishama his son.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-26.htm">1 Chronicles 7:26</a>)<p>&#8226; Ammihud surfaces elsewhere as the father of Elishama, the prince of Ephraim during the wilderness march (<a href="/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; 7:48; 10:23). Chronicles reaches back to that same figure, linking the Exodus generation to the post-Exile readers.<p>&#8226; His placement reminds us that leadership in Israel was rooted in families God had already singled out. <a href="/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18</a> lists the standard of Ephraim under Elishama, son of Ammihud, showing that this household had carried responsibility for the tribe.<p>&#8226; The inclusion of Ammihud also bridges the story between the wilderness and the conquest, pointing forward to Joshua. God not only saved Israel from Egypt but also prepared leaders for the land ahead, just as He equips believers today (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elishama his son</b><p>&#8220;Ladan his son, Ammihud his son, Elishama his son.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-26.htm">1 Chronicles 7:26</a>)<p>&#8226; Elishama is repeatedly named as the chief of Ephraim in the desert era (<a href="/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; 7:48; 10:23). Chronicles positions him right before &#8220;Nun his son, Joshua his son&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-27.htm">1 Chronicles 7:27</a>), spotlighting the family through which God would raise Israel&#8217;s next great leader.<p>&#8226; This shows how God weaves ordinary family lines into His larger purposes. Just as Elishama&#8217;s grandson Joshua would lead Israel into Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1-2</a>), so God often works through the faithfulness of grandparents and parents (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The genealogy also answers post-exilic doubts: if God kept track of every step from Ephraim to Joshua, He will certainly keep His promises to the restored community (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/7-26.htm">1 Chronicles 7:26</a> is more than a string of names; it is a testimony that God faithfully preserves and prepares His people through successive generations. Ladan marks restoration after loss, Ammihud ties the wilderness community to lasting leadership, and Elishama stands on the threshold of Joshua&#8217;s conquest. Together they assure us that the Lord knows every link in the chain and will accomplish His redemptive plan down to the last detail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Blishama son</span> <span class= "bld">of Ammihud</span> was tribal prince or Emir of Ephraim in the time of Moses (<a href="/numbers/7-47.htm" title="And for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Eliasaph the son of Deuel.">Numbers 7:47</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/7-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ladan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#8216;&#183;d&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3936.htm">Strong's 3936: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ladan -- an Ephraimite, also a Gershonite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his son,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
