The anger of the LORD is often depicted in the Old Testament as a response to disobedience or irreverence (e.g., <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>). Uzzah's action was a direct violation of God's command regarding the handling of the Ark of the Covenant, which was to be carried by Levites using poles (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>, <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). This incident underscores the seriousness with which God views His instructions and the sanctity of His presence.<p><b>and He struck him down</b><br>The immediate consequence of Uzzah's action was divine judgment. This reflects the holiness of God and the seriousness of approaching Him with reverence and obedience. The act of striking down is a demonstration of God's justice, similar to other instances where God's holiness was compromised, such as the deaths of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of disregarding God's commands.<p><b>because he had put his hand on the ark</b><br>Touching the Ark was strictly forbidden, as it was the physical representation of God's presence among His people. The Ark was to be treated with utmost respect and was only to be handled by designated individuals under specific conditions (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Uzzah's action, though seemingly well-intentioned, was a breach of divine protocol, highlighting the importance of obedience over human reasoning. This incident emphasizes the need for reverence in worship and adherence to God's instructions.<p><b>So he died there before God</b><br>Uzzah's death occurred in the presence of God, illustrating the immediate and direct nature of divine judgment. This phrase emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and the reality of God's holiness. The location of his death, "before God," signifies the sacredness of the event and the presence of God in the midst of His people. It serves as a powerful reminder of the need for holiness and reverence in the presence of the Almighty, echoing the broader biblical theme that God is to be approached with fear and respect (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah.htm">Uzzah</a></b><br>A man who was struck down by God for touching the Ark of the Covenant.

The Syriac of Samuel reads, "because he put forth his hand;" and so the Arabic, adding, "to the ark." The Targum, "because he sinned" (using a word like hashshal). The Vat.
