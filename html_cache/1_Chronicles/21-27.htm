In the biblical context, angels are often seen as God's messengers or agents carrying out His will. This particular event occurs after David's census of Israel, which displeased God and led to a plague as a form of judgment. The angel here is the one executing the judgment. The intervention of the LORD signifies divine mercy and the cessation of the plague. This moment reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to command His creation, including celestial beings. It also underscores the theme of divine communication and intervention seen throughout Scripture, such as when God speaks to angels in <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11-12</a> during the testing of Abraham.<p><b>who put his sword back into its sheath</b><br>The imagery of the sword being sheathed signifies the end of divine judgment and the restoration of peace. In ancient times, a drawn sword was a symbol of impending battle or judgment, while a sheathed sword indicated the cessation of hostilities. This act of sheathing the sword is a powerful symbol of God's mercy and forgiveness, as the angel ceases the destruction upon God's command. The sword is often used in the Bible as a metaphor for divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). This moment can also be seen as a type of Christ, who through His sacrifice, sheathed the sword of God's wrath against humanity, offering peace and reconciliation with God. The sheathing of the sword here prefigures the ultimate peace brought by Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who commands the angel to cease the plague.

These concluding remarks are not read in Samuel, but the writer, no doubt, found some basis for them in his special source. They tell us how it was that Oman's threshingfloor became recognised as a permanent sanctuary, and the site ordained for the future Temple.
