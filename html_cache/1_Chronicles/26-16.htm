The casting of lots was a common biblical practice used to discern God's will, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a> and <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>. The West Gate and the Shallecheth Gate were significant entry points to the temple area, indicating the importance of the roles assigned to Shuppim and Hosah. The West Gate likely faced the direction of the setting sun, symbolizing the end of the day and the need for vigilance. The Shallecheth Gate, mentioned only here, is thought to be a gate used for the disposal of refuse, suggesting a practical aspect to temple maintenance. The "ascending highway" implies a road leading up to the temple, emphasizing the elevated status of the temple mount. Shuppim and Hosah, Levites, were entrusted with these responsibilities, highlighting the Levitical duty of guarding sacred spaces, as seen in <a href="/numbers/3-32.htm">Numbers 3:32</a>.<p><b>There were guards stationed at every watch.</b><br>The presence of guards at every watch underscores the importance of constant vigilance in protecting the temple, a theme echoed in <a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>, where watchfulness is paired with prayer. The division of watches into shifts ensured that the temple was protected day and night, reflecting the perpetual nature of God's covenant with Israel. This practice can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate guardian and shepherd of His people, as described in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>. The concept of watchfulness is also a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers are urged to be spiritually alert, as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>. The guards' role in maintaining the sanctity of the temple parallels the Christian call to guard one's heart and faith, as instructed in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shuppim_and_hosah.htm">Shuppim and Hosah</a></b><br>These are the gatekeepers mentioned in this verse. They were responsible for guarding the West Gate and the gate of Shallecheth. Their role was crucial in maintaining the security and sanctity of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/west_gate.htm">West Gate</a></b><br>This was one of the gates of the temple, indicating a specific location that required guarding.

The verse showcases God&#8217;s orderly care for His house, the redemption of once-fallen families, and the call for continual vigilance as His people draw near in worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">To Shuppim and Hosah.</span>--No such name as Shuppim (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-12.htm" title="Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the sons of Aher.">1Chronicles 7:12</a>) occurs among those of the Levitical warders as given above in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-1.htm" title="Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.">1Chronicles 26:1-11</a>. It is almost certainly a mistaken repetition of the last two syllables of Asuppim, which immediately precedes it. (The mistake is as old as the Vulgate; the LXX. has <span class= "greekheb">??? ????????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> perhaps reading <span class= "ital">lishnayim</span> instead of <span class= "ital">le Shuppim.</span>) Read: <span class= "ital">And to Hosah</span> (the lot fell) <span class= "ital">to the west, with the gate Shalleketh on the highway that goeth up.</span><p><span class= "bld">The gate Shalleketh,</span> mentioned here only. The name means <span class= "ital">casting down</span> (in <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>, it denotes <span class= "ital">felling</span> a tree); and hence this gate has been identified with the "Rubbish" or "Refuse Gate." (Comp. <a href="/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate.">Nehemiah 3:13</a>.) It seems an objection to this, that the gate faced <span class= "ital">the highway that goeth up</span> from the lower city to the Temple. Perhaps the name alludes to the drop, or steep descent, from the Sanctuary to the city.<p><span class= "bld">Ward against ward.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">mishm?r l?</span>'<span class= "ital">ummath mishm?r.</span> Compare the use of the same preposition in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-12.htm" title="Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.">1Chronicles 26:12</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/25-8.htm" title="And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.">1Chronicles 25:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1Chronicles 24:31</a>. Here the meaning seems to be that Hosah had to guard two posts, viz., the western gate of the Temple, and the gate Shalleketh which lay opposite, in the western wall of the Temple area. (The LXX. has ??????? <span class= "greekheb">????????? ???????</span>; the Vulgate <span class= "ital">custodia contra custodiam;</span> implying that Hosah's warders were stationed opposite to each other.) But perhaps these concluding words refer to all four stations, and should be rendered, <span class= "ital">ward like ward,</span> or <span class= "ital">ward and ward alike,</span> or <span class= "ital">post over against post.</span> . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[The lots] for the West Gate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
