Centuries later, David is arranging for the Ark&#8217;s return to Jerusalem, and he deliberately draws from every Levitical branch so that the entire tribe shares in the blessing (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>; 15:11&#8211;12). The Gershomites&#8217; inclusion shows:<p>&#8226; Worship is a whole-family calling; no tribe is sidelined (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Every believer&#8217;s heritage matters; God doesn&#8217;t forget ancestral promises (<a href="/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a> fulfilled here).<p>&#8226; Holiness has to be corporate, not just personal&#8212;each clan models reverence together (<a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joel the chief</b><p>Next, Scripture narrows its lens to &#8220;Joel the chief.&#8221; Leadership is personal and named; God never reduces people to statistics. Joel&#8217;s appointment echoes how Moses and Aaron were singled out for specific tasks (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>). Within the Gershomite line, Joel now shoulders responsibility to:<p>&#8226; Instruct his relatives in transporting the Ark &#8220;as the LORD commanded&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13</a>; 15:15).<p>&#8226; Maintain purity and order, guarding against the earlier tragedy when Uzzah died because the Ark was mishandled (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Model joyful, obedient worship so that the nation sees reverence wedded to celebration (<a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>David&#8217;s trust in Joel underscores that spiritual authority flows from faithfulness, not fame (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-12.htm">2 Chronicles 29:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and 130 of his relatives</b><p>Finally, the verse records &#8220;130 of his relatives.&#8221; God values precise numbers (<a href="/genesis/7-2.htm">Genesis 7:2</a>; <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>) because every individual counts. Here, 130 Levites combine strength and unity, creating a living shield around the Ark (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-26.htm">1 Chronicles 15:26</a>). Their presence teaches:<p>&#8226; Holiness scales&#8212;large teams can still walk in ordered obedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Accountability&#8212;each man&#8217;s name is implicitly on heaven&#8217;s roll call (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Shared joy&#8212;corporate worship magnifies praise (<a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>).<p>Their coordinated service mirrors later moments when Jesus sent out the seventy-two in pairs (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), showing that mission is safest and most effective in community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7</a> may look like a simple roster, but it underscores enduring truths: God honors every branch of His family, raises identifiable leaders, and delights in large, unified teams who gladly obey His word. The verse invites believers today to embrace heritage, step into responsible leadership, and link arms with fellow saints so that God&#8217;s presence is carried with reverence and joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">from the Gershomites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3100.htm">Strong's 3100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joel -- probably 'the LORD is God', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the chief</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and 130</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his relatives;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">1 Chronicles 15:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/15-7.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 15:7 Of the sons of Gershom Joel (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/15-6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 15:6"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 15:6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/15-8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 15:8"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 15:8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
