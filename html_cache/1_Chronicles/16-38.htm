He is known for housing the Ark in his home for three months, during which time the Lord blessed his household (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>). This blessing likely contributed to his continued service in the temple. The mention of his sixty-eight relatives indicates a large family, which was common in ancient Israelite society, emphasizing the importance of family and community in religious service. This large number also suggests the dedication and commitment of Obed-edom's family to the service of the Lord, reflecting the communal nature of worship and service in Israel.<p><b>Obed-edom son of Jeduthun,</b><br>Jeduthun, also known as Ethan, was one of the chief musicians appointed by David for the worship in the tabernacle (<a href="/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>). This connection highlights the musical and worship heritage within Obed-edom's family, suggesting that service to God was a family tradition. The lineage indicates a continuity of faith and service, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where family lines often carried specific roles or blessings.<p><b>and also Hosah,</b><br>Hosah was a Levite of the family of Merari, one of the three main divisions of the Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a>). The Merarites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's structure, including its frames, bars, pillars, and bases (<a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>). Hosah's inclusion as a gatekeeper signifies the importance of the Levites in maintaining the sanctity and order of the temple, a role that required trustworthiness and dedication.<p><b>were to be gatekeepers.</b><br>Gatekeepers had a crucial role in the temple, responsible for guarding the entrances and ensuring that only those who were ceremonially clean could enter (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>). This role was not merely about physical security but also about maintaining the spiritual purity of the worship space. Gatekeepers were seen as protectors of the sacred, a role that can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "door" or "gate" for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-7.htm">John 10:7</a>). This typology underscores the protective and mediating role of Christ in the New Testament, connecting the Old Testament roles to the fulfillment found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed-edom.htm">Obed-edom</a></b><br>A Levite who is noted for his role as a gatekeeper and for housing the Ark of the Covenant.

Explanation is needed of the <span class="accented">plural</span> pronoun "their." Either another name is wanted with Obed-edom, or tacit reference is made to "Asaph and his brethren," as though the name Asaph had not been followed in its own place by the clause "and his brethren." Keil draws attention to the "three score and two" of <a href="/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>, in connection with the <span class="cmt_word">three score and eight</span> of this place; and it has been proposed to make up this number by some of the sons of <span class="cmt_word">Hosah</span>, of our following verse and of <a href="/1_chronicles/26-11.htm">1 Chronicles 26:11</a>. In this case the name Hesah might be the name missing before, "and their brethren."
