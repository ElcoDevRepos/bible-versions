This reflects the cultural and historical context where young men were not considered part of the military force. David's decision not to count those under twenty aligns with the practice of counting only those eligible for military service, as seen in <a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>. This also demonstrates David's adherence to divine instructions, as counting the people without God's command was seen as an act of pride or lack of trust in God's provision.<p><b>because the LORD had said</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of divine command and guidance in the actions of Israel's leaders. It reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God's word was the ultimate authority. The reference to God's word indicates that David's actions were in response to a specific divine directive, emphasizing obedience to God's promises and commands. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where blessings and curses are contingent upon adherence to God's word.<p><b>that He would make Israel as numerous as the stars of the sky</b><br>This promise echoes the covenant God made with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a> and reiterated to Isaac and Jacob. It signifies not only a promise of numerical growth but also a spiritual and covenantal relationship with God. The imagery of stars suggests an innumerable and divinely blessed nation, highlighting God's faithfulness to His promises. This promise is prophetic, pointing to the future expansion and spiritual significance of Israel, ultimately fulfilled in the coming of Jesus Christ and the inclusion of Gentiles into the spiritual Israel, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and leadership.

Earlier censuses (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>; 26:2) began at age twenty because that was the minimum age for military service. David follows the same pattern&#8212;yet here he purposely leaves out the younger males.<p>&#8226; His decision contrasts sharply with the disastrous census in <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a> and <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a>, where counting the fighting men apart from God&#8217;s direction brought judgment. Having learned that lesson, David now refuses to tally anyone who would swell his army&#8217;s headcount.<p>&#8226; By withholding the youngest males, David signals his refusal to depend on raw numbers for security. Instead of &#8220;strength in numbers,&#8221; he places confidence in the Lord who fights Israel&#8217;s battles (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the LORD had said</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s restraint is not mere prudence; it is obedience. The narrative explains that he acted &#8220;because the LORD had said.&#8221; God&#8217;s spoken word is always the final authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience often requires saying no to seemingly practical steps. Counting every potential soldier looked logical, yet God&#8217;s prior command overruled human strategy (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This clause reminds us that any plan&#8212;military, financial, or personal&#8212;must yield to what God has already said in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He would make Israel as numerous as the stars of the sky</b><p>&#8226; The reason behind God&#8217;s instruction reaches back to His covenant promise: &#8220;Look to the heavens and count the stars&#8230; so shall your offspring be&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; also 22:17; 26:4; 28:14).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s refusal to number the under-twenties testifies that their increase depends on divine promise, not human accounting. By not counting, he leaves room for God to fulfill His word literally&#8212;an ever-expanding nation beyond anyone&#8217;s register (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>; 10:22).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;stars&#8221; metaphor underlines both vast quantity and covenant certainty (<a href="/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a>). Just as stars are real and visible, so God intends a tangible, literal multitude. David&#8217;s faith aligns with that certainty, modeling trust that God will do exactly what He said.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a> shows David acting in humble, obedient faith. He excludes the youngest males from the census because God had already pledged an immeasurable population for Israel. Rather than rely on headcounts or military logic, he trusts the covenant-keeping Lord to multiply His people &#8220;as numerous as the stars of the sky.&#8221; The verse invites us to measure safety and success not by statistics but by the sure word of God, whose promises remain literal, reliable, and sufficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">But David took</span> (<a href="/numbers/3-40.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.">Numbers 3:40</a>, <span class= "ital">n?s?'mispar</span>) <span class= "bld">not the number of them.</span>--This and the next verse contain concluding remarks on the two lists communicated in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-1.htm" title="Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:1-22</a>. The heading of the chapter professes that the "sons of Israel, <span class= "ital">according to their number</span>," is the subject in hand. This appended note limits that statement to those who were above "twenty years old," that is, to those who were of the military age. The reference is undoubtedly to the census, of which 1 Chronicles 21 gave the account; and it is evident that one of the main objects of that census was the military and political organisation here so scantily and obscurely described.<p><span class= "bld">Because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.</span>--The reason why David restricted the census to those who were capable of bearing arms (see <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>). The idea implied seems to be that to attempt to number Israel would be to evince a distrust of Jehovah's faithfulness; and, perhaps, that such an attempt could not possibly succeed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The contents of this and the following verse may be supposed to be suggested by the distinct reference to the matter of number in the first verse of the chapter, and in the latter halves of the following fourteen verses, contrasting with the utter absence of any allusion to the same matter, when the whole body of the <span class="accented">tribes and their princes</span> are the subject, in vers. 16-22.
