Historically, these men were known for their courage, as seen in their earlier rescue by Saul from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11). Their valor is a testament to their gratitude and respect for Saul, despite his tragic end. This act of bravery also reflects the cultural importance of honoring the dead, especially those who had once been leaders.<p><b>and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons</b><br>The retrieval of the bodies signifies an act of respect and honor. In ancient Israelite culture, proper burial was crucial, and leaving bodies exposed was considered a disgrace. The Philistines had displayed the bodies as a sign of victory, but the men of Jabesh-gilead risked their lives to ensure Saul and his sons received a dignified burial. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of the duty to honor one's leaders, even in death.<p><b>and brought them to Jabesh</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city in the territory of Manasseh, east of the Jordan River. The city's connection to Saul dates back to his first military victory, which endeared him to its inhabitants. Bringing the bodies to Jabesh symbolizes a return to a place of initial triumph and loyalty. This act of bringing the bodies back can be seen as a form of restitution and closure for the people of Jabesh-gilead.<p><b>And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh</b><br>The burial under the oak tree is significant. Oaks were often associated with significant events and were considered sacred in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This particular oak may have been a landmark or a place of gathering. The burial under the oak signifies a place of honor and remembrance, ensuring that Saul and his sons would be remembered with respect. This act also reflects the biblical theme of trees as symbols of life and continuity.<p><b>and fasted seven days</b><br>Fasting for seven days was a traditional period of mourning in ancient Israel. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible, indicating a full period of mourning. This fasting was a sign of deep grief and respect for the deceased. It also reflects the communal aspect of mourning, as the people of Jabesh-gilead collectively expressed their sorrow and paid homage to Saul and his sons.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/valiant_men.htm">Valiant Men</a></b><br>These were brave warriors from Jabesh-gilead who risked their lives to retrieve the bodies of Saul and his sons.

This verse does not tell us, as the parallel (<a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) does, of the first burning of the bodies, and then of the burying of the calcined bones. The silence is very remarkable. It does name the kind of tree, the "oak" or "terebinth." The word for the tree, however, in both passages is of doubtful and perhaps only generic signification. The several Hebrew words translated in various places as "oak," all share a common root, significant of the idea of <span class="accented">strength.</span> Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 243, 244) says that the country owns still to an abundance of oaks of very fine growth in some cases, and that these are exceedingly more plentiful and altogether a stronger tree than the "terebinth." The different names, though all connected with one root, referred to are probably owing to the large variety of oaks. With the statement of the burying of the bones under a tree, and the fasting of seven days on the part of these brave and grateful men of Jabesh-gilead, the <span class="accented">parallel</span> account comes to its end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their valiant warriors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#363;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
