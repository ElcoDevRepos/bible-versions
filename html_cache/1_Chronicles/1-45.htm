The mention of his death signifies the end of his reign and the beginning of another, highlighting the temporal nature of human authority. Jobab is listed among the kings of Edom, a region south of the Dead Sea, which was often in conflict with Israel. This transition reflects the broader biblical narrative of the rise and fall of leaders and nations, emphasizing God's sovereignty over history.<p><b>Husham from the land of the Temanites</b><br>Husham's origin from the land of the Temanites connects him to the region of Teman, which is associated with Edom. Teman was known for its wise men, as referenced in the book of Obadiah and Jeremiah. The Temanites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and thus related to the Israelites. This connection underscores the complex relationships between the Edomites and Israelites throughout biblical history. The mention of Husham's origin may also suggest the influence of Edomite culture and wisdom during his reign.<p><b>reigned in his place</b><br>The phrase indicates the continuation of leadership and governance, a theme prevalent in the biblical narrative. The succession of kings in Edom parallels the succession of kings in Israel and Judah, illustrating the political structures of the ancient Near East. This transition of power is a reminder of the cyclical nature of human leadership, contrasting with the eternal kingship of God. The reign of Husham, like other Edomite kings, is part of the broader biblical story of God's dealings with the nations surrounding Israel, often serving as a backdrop for Israel's own history and prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jobab.htm">Jobab</a></b><br>A king mentioned in the genealogies of Edom, who reigned before Husham.
