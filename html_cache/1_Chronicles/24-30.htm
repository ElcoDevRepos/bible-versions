The Levites were set apart for the service of the tabernacle and later the temple. Mushi's descendants, like other Levites, had specific roles in the religious practices of Israel. This lineage emphasizes the importance of family and heritage in maintaining the duties assigned to the Levites.<p><b>Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth:</b><br>These names represent the continuation of the Levitical line through Mushi. Mahli is also mentioned in other genealogical records, indicating the significance of maintaining detailed family records for the Levites. Eder and Jerimoth, while less frequently mentioned, are part of the broader narrative of the Levites' role in Israel's worship. The listing of these names underscores the meticulous care taken in preserving the priestly and Levitical lines, which were crucial for the proper functioning of temple worship.<p><b>These were the sons of the Levites:</b><br>The Levites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties. Unlike the other tribes, they did not receive a territorial inheritance but were given cities scattered throughout Israel. Their primary role was to assist the priests, the descendants of Aaron, in the temple service. This phrase highlights the special status of the Levites and their integral role in the spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>According to their families:</b><br>The organization of the Levites into families was essential for the distribution of duties and responsibilities in the temple service. Each family had specific roles, ensuring that the worship and rituals were conducted according to the law given by God. This structure reflects the order and precision that characterized the Levitical service, which was a type of the order and holiness required in the worship of God. The emphasis on family lineage also points to the continuity of God's covenant with Israel, as the Levites were entrusted with the care of the tabernacle and later the temple, serving as a bridge between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mushi.htm">Mushi</a></b><br>A Levite, son of Merari, and one of the three main divisions of the Levites.

By recording his line again in chapter 24, the writer underscores the faithfulness of God in tracing every Levitical branch.<p>&#8226; Genealogies are not filler; they certify the historical roots of Israel&#8217;s worship. <a href="/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33&#8211;34</a> lays the same groundwork: &#8220;From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The Chronicler is arranging priests for temple service under David. By naming Mushi, he shows that every clan&#8212;even a smaller one&#8212;receives a place in God&#8217;s orderly plan (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth</b><p>&#8226; These three grandsons receive individual mention in both <a href="/1_chronicles/23-23.htm">1 Chronicles 23:23 and 24</a>:30.

It is to be observed that, in the foregoing verses, we have no expressed sum of the families or heads to which they add up.

Others, omitting the three names of Shoham, Zaccur, Ibri, bring the twenty-five to twenty-two. Keil finds only fifteen "heads" or "classes," but surmises that the Hebronite and Mushite "fathers' houses" may have been numerous enough to find more than one "class;" and thereby to make up the twenty-four classes which he desires as well for symmetry's sake as for the patent suggestions of ver. 31. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/24-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
