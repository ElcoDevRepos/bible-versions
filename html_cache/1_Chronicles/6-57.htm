Hebron, located in the hill country of Judah, was one of the cities designated as a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). These cities were places where individuals who had accidentally committed manslaughter could seek asylum until a fair trial. Hebron's designation as a city of refuge underscores its importance in maintaining justice and mercy within the Israelite community. Hebron is also historically significant as the burial place of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, linking it to the covenantal promises given to the patriarchs.<p><b>Libnah</b><br>Libnah was a Levitical city located in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah. It was one of the cities given to the priests, emphasizing the provision for those who served in the temple. Libnah's mention in the context of the Levitical cities highlights the distribution of land to the Levites, who did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. This city also appears in the narrative of the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29-30</a>), where it was captured by Joshua, demonstrating God's faithfulness in delivering the land to Israel.<p><b>Jattir</b><br>Jattir was another city allocated to the descendants of Aaron, located in the hill country of Judah. It served as a Levitical city, providing for the priests who ministered before the Lord. The allocation of Jattir to the priests reflects the broader theme of God's provision for those dedicated to His service. Jattir is mentioned in the context of David's time, where it is noted as a place to which David sent spoils after his victory over the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/30-27.htm">1 Samuel 30:27</a>), indicating its continued significance in Israel's history.<p><b>Eshtemoa</b><br>Eshtemoa, also in the hill country of Judah, was given to the priests as a Levitical city. Its inclusion in the list of cities for the descendants of Aaron highlights the strategic placement of Levitical cities throughout Israel to ensure the spiritual leadership and instruction of the people. Eshtemoa is mentioned in the context of David's interactions with the people of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>), further illustrating its role in the community. The presence of these cities in Judah underscores the integration of religious and communal life in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and ancestor of the Levitical priesthood.

This reminds us of God's faithfulness in providing for our needs when we serve Him wholeheartedly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_cities_of_refuge.htm">The Role of Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Cities of refuge illustrate God's balance of justice and mercy. They provided a safe haven for those who unintentionally caused harm, ensuring that justice was served without undue vengeance. This concept can inspire us to seek justice tempered with mercy in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_significance_of_hebron.htm">Spiritual Significance of Hebron</a></b><br>Hebron's designation as a city of refuge and its historical connections to patriarchs like Abraham and King David highlight its spiritual significance.

Housing priests there wove worship, history, and leadership together.<p>- As a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>), Hebron modeled God&#8217;s mercy: accidental killers could flee there until judgment. That picture foreshadows Christ, our ultimate refuge (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<p>- The priests living in Hebron ministered to fugitives, interceded for the surrounding tribe of Judah, and reminded everyone that justice and grace meet in God&#8217;s presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Libnah</b><p>- <a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a> pairs Libnah with Hebron as another priestly town. Its placement on Judah&#8217;s western flank meant the Word and sacrifices were available near the Philistine border&#8212;God&#8217;s truth on the frontier.<p>- Libnah later revolted against ungodly King Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-10.htm">2 Chronicles 21:10</a>), suggesting the town&#8217;s priestly heritage may have fueled resistance to idolatry.<p>- By recording Libnah here, the chronicler underscores that every inch of land promised in <a href="/bsb/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a> was literally allotted. God&#8217;s faithfulness is geographic as well as spiritual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jattir</b><p>- Mentioned alongside other priestly towns in <a href="/joshua/21-14.htm">Joshua 21:14</a>, Jattir sat in the Judean hill country. David later shared battle spoils with &#8220;the elders of Jattir&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-27.htm">1 Samuel 30:27</a>), indicating a continuing priestly presence that fostered loyalty to God&#8217;s anointed king.<p>- Its high elevation offered security, symbolizing how priestly ministry lifts people toward God (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- Recording Jattir proves that even smaller villages mattered to the Lord&#8217;s plan; no community was too remote for priestly teaching (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eshtemoa</b><p>- Also in <a href="/joshua/21-14.htm">Joshua 21:14</a>, Eshtemoa received priests right beside Jattir. David again honored it with gifts (<a href="/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>), showing mutual support between shepherd-king and shepherd-priests.<p>- Situated on trade routes through southern Judah, Eshtemoa let travelers encounter priests who could explain the covenant (<a href="/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- The chronicler&#8217;s precise listing assures readers that the historical distribution of Levitical towns was not accidental but orchestrated by God for continual witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-57.htm">1 Chronicles 6:57</a> faithfully recounts four towns given to Aaron&#8217;s descendants. Each location&#8212;Hebron the refuge, Libnah the frontier post, Jattir the hillside haven, and Eshtemoa the crossroads&#8212;illustrates God&#8217;s literal provision for His priests and His desire to embed worship, instruction, and mercy throughout the land. The verse is a reminder that God keeps every promise in detail and positions His servants where their ministry will radiate His grace to all who draw near.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(57) <span class= "bld">They gave the cities of Judah.</span>--Heb. text, <span class= "ital">the cities of refuge, Hebron and Libnah, and her pastures.</span> Of the cities mentioned only Hebron was an asylum for the manslayer.
