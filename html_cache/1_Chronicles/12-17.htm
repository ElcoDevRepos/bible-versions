This action reflects the importance of personal engagement and assessment of intentions, a trait seen in other biblical leaders like Moses and Nehemiah. David's willingness to confront potential allies or adversaries directly is a testament to his courage and wisdom.<p><b>&#8220;If you have come to me in peace to help me,</b><br>David's conditional statement underscores the importance of peace and unity in his reign. The emphasis on peace aligns with the biblical theme of shalom, which encompasses wholeness and harmony. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where peace is a sign of God's favor and blessing, as seen in Psalms and the prophetic visions of Isaiah.<p><b>my heart will be united with you;</b><br>The phrase indicates a deep commitment and alliance, suggesting that David values loyalty and mutual support. This unity is reminiscent of the covenant relationships seen throughout the Bible, such as Jonathan and David's friendship. It also prefigures the unity Christ desires among His followers, as expressed in <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.<p><b>but if you have come to betray me to my enemies</b><br>David acknowledges the possibility of betrayal, a recurring theme in his life, notably with Saul and later with Absalom. This awareness of potential treachery reflects the human condition and the need for discernment, a wisdom echoed in Proverbs. Betrayal is a motif that also points to Judas' betrayal of Jesus, highlighting the cost of leadership and the reality of human sin.<p><b>when my hands are free of violence,</b><br>David asserts his innocence and integrity, emphasizing that he has not wronged those who might seek to harm him. This claim of innocence is crucial in biblical narratives, where leaders often appeal to their righteousness before God, as seen in the Psalms. It also foreshadows Christ's sinlessness and His unjust suffering.<p><b>may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.&#8221;</b><br>David invokes the God of their ancestors, appealing to the covenantal relationship established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This invocation underscores God's role as the ultimate judge and arbiter of justice, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. It reflects the biblical principle that God sees all actions and will hold individuals accountable, as seen in the prophetic writings and the teachings of Jesus on judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who was in the process of consolidating his rule and gathering support from various tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_benjamin_and_judah.htm">The Men of Benjamin and Judah</a></b><br>These were warriors who came to David at Ziklag, seeking to join his forces.
