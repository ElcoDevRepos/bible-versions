This reflects the structured organization of worship in ancient Israel, emphasizing the importance of music in temple services. The name Nethaniah means "given of the Lord," which may indicate a family dedicated to divine service. This order of musicians is part of a larger system established by David, which included 24 divisions, each serving in the temple for a specific period. This structure is mirrored in the priestly divisions found in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers</b><br>The inclusion of both sons and brothers suggests a family-based approach to temple service, which was common in ancient Israel. This familial involvement ensured continuity and the passing down of skills and traditions. It also highlights the communal aspect of worship, where families served together, fostering unity and shared purpose. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of the church as a family of believers, each contributing their gifts to the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>12 in all</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often symbolizing completeness or divine order. In this context, it may reflect the completeness of the musical group serving in the temple.
