Edom, located to the south of the Kingdom of Judah, was a significant area due to its trade routes and resources. By establishing military outposts, David ensured the security and stability of his kingdom's southern border. This action reflects the fulfillment of earlier prophecies and promises regarding Israel's expansion and dominance over its neighbors, as seen in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> and <a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>. The presence of garrisons also indicates a period of peace and order under David's rule, as these outposts would deter rebellion and maintain control.<p><b>and all the Edomites were subject to David</b><br>The subjugation of the Edomites under David's rule highlights the extent of his kingdom and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel. Historically, the Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and had a tumultuous relationship with Israel. This subjugation can be seen as a reversal of the earlier enmity and a demonstration of God's favor upon David. It also prefigures the ultimate reign of Christ, who will bring all nations under His dominion, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8-11</a>. The Edomites' submission is a testament to David's military prowess and God's providential guidance.<p><b>So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine favor and blessing upon David's reign. It was not merely David's military skill or strategic acumen that led to his victories, but the LORD's intervention and support. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in David's life, as seen in his battles against Goliath and the Philistines. The victories granted to David are a fulfillment of God's covenant with him, as outlined in <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>, where God promises to establish David's kingdom. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, who will triumph over all spiritual and earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and his heart for God.
