This tribe held a significant position in Israel's history, being the tribe of King Saul, Israel's first king. The allocation of cities to the Levites from Benjamin highlights the tribe's role in supporting the religious and priestly functions in Israel.<p><b>they were given Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant city located northwest of Jerusalem. It was known for the Gibeonite deception in <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>, where the inhabitants tricked Israel into making a peace treaty. Gibeon later became a Levitical city, emphasizing its importance in religious activities. It was also the site where Solomon offered sacrifices early in his reign (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>).<p><b>Geba</b><br>Geba was a city on the northern border of Judah and Benjamin, often associated with military significance. It was fortified by King Asa of Judah (<a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>) and played a role in various military campaigns. Its inclusion as a Levitical city underscores its strategic and religious importance.<p><b>Alemeth</b><br>Alemeth, sometimes identified with Almon, was a city in the territory of Benjamin. Its mention as a Levitical city indicates its role in supporting the Levites, who were responsible for religious duties and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation.<p><b>and Anathoth</b><br>Anathoth was a city in Benjamin, known as the hometown of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). It was a Levitical city, highlighting its religious significance. Anathoth's association with Jeremiah connects it to themes of prophecy and repentance, as Jeremiah called the nation back to faithfulness.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands was essential for the Levites, who did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. These lands provided for their livestock and sustenance, allowing them to focus on their priestly duties. This provision reflects God's care for those dedicated to His service.<p><b>So they had thirteen cities in all among their families</b><br>The Levites were distributed among the tribes of Israel, receiving cities and surrounding lands to live and serve. The number thirteen may symbolize completeness and provision, ensuring the Levites were integrated into the community life of Israel. This distribution allowed them to fulfill their roles as teachers and spiritual leaders throughout the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel.
