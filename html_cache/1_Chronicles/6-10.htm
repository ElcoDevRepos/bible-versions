Johanan, though not extensively detailed in other scriptures, is part of the lineage that traces back to Aaron, the first high priest. This lineage underscores the continuity and legitimacy of the priestly line, which was crucial for maintaining religious and social order in Israel. The name Johanan means "Yahweh is gracious," reflecting the theological emphasis on God's grace in the priestly service.<p><b>who served as priest</b><br>Azariah's role as a priest highlights the importance of the priesthood in mediating between God and the people of Israel. Priests were responsible for performing sacrifices, maintaining the temple, and teaching the law. Azariah's service would have included these duties, ensuring the spiritual well-being of the nation. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as the ultimate High Priest, mediating a new covenant between God and humanity.<p><b>in the temple that Solomon built</b><br>This refers to the First Temple, also known as Solomon's Temple, which was constructed in the 10th century BC. It was the central place of worship for the Israelites and housed the Ark of the Covenant. The temple's construction is detailed in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6-7</a>, and it symbolizes God's presence among His people. The temple's design and function foreshadow the coming of Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that He is the ultimate dwelling place of God's presence.<p><b>in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem is the city chosen by God as the spiritual and political center of Israel. It holds significant historical and theological importance, being the site of the temple and the city of David. Jerusalem is frequently mentioned in biblical prophecy and is central to eschatological themes. The city's selection as the location for the temple underscores its role as a focal point for worship and divine revelation. In Christian theology, Jerusalem is also symbolic of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan.htm">Johanan</a></b><br>A descendant of Aaron, the high priest, and part of the Levitical priesthood lineage.

By recording that &#8220;Johanan was the father,&#8221; the Chronicler anchors the priestly line in real history, tying this name to the earlier list in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-9.htm">1 Chronicles 6:9</a> and continuing the line that began with Aaron (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Genealogies in Scripture are never filler; they safeguard the covenant promise that a faithful priesthood would endure (<a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-50.htm">1 Chronicles 6:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Ezra later traced his own pedigree back through Zadok (<a href="/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1&#8211;5</a>), this brief statement underlines the accuracy and reliability of God&#8217;s record of lineage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Azariah</b><p>&#8226;

The name itself, repeatedly used for priests and kings, reminds readers that the Lord is the true source of help behind every human servant (<a href="/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By singling out this Azariah, Scripture highlights how God raises up the right leader for each generation (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-11.htm">1 Chronicles 6:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who served as priest</b><p>&#8226; Service, not status, marks the calling: &#8220;For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Azariah&#8217;s ministry followed the same pattern given to Aaron&#8212;offering sacrifices, teaching the Law, and blessing the people (<a href="/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-49.htm">1 Chronicles 6:49</a>).<p>&#8226; His vocation foreshadows the perfect priesthood of Christ, &#8220;appointed to act on behalf of men in matters relating to God&#8221;

Azariah&#8217;s daily duties&#8212;lighting lamps, burning incense, presenting offerings&#8212;kept Israel&#8217;s focus on the LORD who said, &#8220;My Name shall be there&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The temple provided a visible sign of God&#8217;s dwelling with His people (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Solomon built in Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226;

By linking Azariah to that specific structure, the text roots priestly ministry in a concrete time and place&#8212;Jerusalem, the city God chose &#8220;for My Name to dwell&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> is far more than a passing genealogical note.
