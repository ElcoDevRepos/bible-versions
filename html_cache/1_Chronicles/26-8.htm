His descendants, therefore, are often associated with divine favor and service to God. The mention of his lineage here emphasizes the continuity of God's blessings and the importance of family heritage in the service of the Lord.<p><b>they and their sons and brothers</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal and familial nature of service in the temple. In ancient Israel, family units often worked together, and the service of God was a family affair. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational faithfulness and the importance of raising children in the knowledge and service of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>were capable men with strength to do the work&#8212;</b><br>The emphasis on capability and strength suggests that the tasks assigned to these men required physical and perhaps spiritual fortitude. In the context of temple service, this could involve guarding the temple, managing its operations, or other duties that required diligence and integrity. This mirrors the New Testament call for believers to be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>).<p><b>62 in all from Obed-edom.</b><br>The specific number of 62 descendants underscores the significant contribution of Obed-edom's family to the temple service. Numbers in the Bible often carry symbolic meaning, and while 62 does not have a widely recognized symbolic interpretation, the precision of the count reflects the order and organization within the Levitical duties. This meticulous record-keeping is consistent with the chronicler's intent to document the faithfulness and structure of Israel's worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed-edom.htm">Obed-edom</a></b><br>A Levite who was entrusted with the Ark of the Covenant.

Temple service was a family affair; Levites were assigned by clan (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-9</a>). Here, the chronicler highlights unity: this was not a loose collection of volunteers but a coordinated, committed family team.<p>&#8226; Ministry that spans generations mirrors God&#8217;s design for faith to be taught &#8220;to your children and your grandchildren&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of both &#8220;sons and brothers&#8221; shows younger and older working side by side, illustrating <a href="/titus/2-1.htm">Titus 2:1-8</a> long before Paul wrote it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were capable men</b><p>The Berean Standard Bible calls them &#8220;capable men,&#8221; echoing the phrase Moses used for the leaders he appointed (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>). Capability here is more than muscle strength; it includes integrity, reliability, and skill. The same Hebrew word describes David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>), suggesting that temple gatekeepers needed courage comparable to soldiers.<p>&#8226; God expects those who guard His house to be trustworthy (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Ability plus character turns service into worship (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with strength to do the work</b><p>Guarding the temple gates involved long hours, heavy doors, and constant vigilance (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12, 27</a>).

What began with one faithful Levite multiplied into an entire security team for the temple. The count invites us to notice the measurable impact of obedience&#8212;God&#8217;s blessings are often countable (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The number also stresses completeness: every descendant who met the qualifications was enlisted; none were left on the sidelines (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a> spotlights a family transformed by God&#8217;s blessing and devoted to His house.
