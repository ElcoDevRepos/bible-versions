The name Abishur means "my father is a wall," suggesting strength and protection, which is fitting for a member of the tribe of Judah, known for leadership and kingship. Abihail, meaning "my father is might," is a name that appears several times in the Old Testament, often associated with women of noble character. The mention of Abihail as Abishur's wife highlights the importance of lineage and family connections in the genealogies of 1 Chronicles, which trace the heritage of the tribes of Israel.<p><b>and she bore to him Ahban and Molid</b><br>The genealogical records in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the continuity of God's covenant with Israel through the line of Judah. Ahban and Molid, though not prominent figures elsewhere in the Bible, are part of this lineage, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding his descendants. The chronicler's inclusion of these names underscores the importance of every family within the tribe, contributing to the larger narrative of Israel's history.
