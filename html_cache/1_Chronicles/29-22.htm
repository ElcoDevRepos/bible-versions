Eating and drinking with joy signifies a covenantal meal, reflecting the peace and unity among the people. Such feasts were common in Israelite culture during significant religious and national events, symbolizing God's provision and blessing. The presence of the LORD indicates that this was not merely a social gathering but a sacred occasion, acknowledging God's sovereignty and favor. This mirrors other biblical instances where communal meals are held in God's presence, such as the Passover (Exodus 12) and the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-14.htm">Luke 22:14-20</a>).<p><b>Then, for a second time, they designated David&#8217;s son Solomon as king,</b><br>The phrase "for a second time" refers to the reaffirmation of Solomon's kingship, initially declared in <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>. This second anointing was necessary to solidify Solomon's position amidst potential challenges, particularly from Adonijah, who had previously attempted to claim the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>). The public designation underscores the importance of divine and communal approval in leadership transitions. Solomon's kingship fulfills God's promise to David that his lineage would continue to rule Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), a key element in the Davidic Covenant.<p><b>anointing him before the LORD as ruler,</b><br>Anointing was a sacred act symbolizing God's choice and empowerment of a leader. It involved pouring oil on the head, signifying the Holy Spirit's presence and blessing. This act before the LORD emphasizes divine endorsement and the spiritual nature of Solomon's kingship. Anointing is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the anointing of priests (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>) and kings like Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). It foreshadows the ultimate anointed one, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, whose title "Christ" means "Anointed One."<p><b>and Zadok as the priest.</b><br>Zadok's anointing as priest signifies the establishment of a faithful priesthood during Solomon's reign. Zadok, a descendant of Aaron, was loyal to David and supported Solomon's succession (<a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-39</a>). His appointment reflects the continuity of the Levitical priesthood and the importance of spiritual leadership in Israel. Zadok's priesthood is later referenced in Ezekiel's vision of the future temple (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>), symbolizing faithfulness and purity. This priestly role points to Jesus Christ, our High Priest, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The outgoing king of Israel, who has been a man after God's own heart and has prepared the way for his son Solomon to succeed him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>David's son, anointed as king of Israel, known for his wisdom and later for building the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok.htm">Zadok</a></b><br>A priest who is anointed alongside Solomon, signifying the establishment of a new order in the priesthood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing_ceremony.htm">The Anointing Ceremony</a></b><br>A significant event where Solomon is anointed as king, marking the divine approval and public recognition of his kingship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_the_lord.htm">The Presence of the LORD</a></b><br>The setting of the event, emphasizing the spiritual significance and divine approval of the proceedings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_the_presence_of_the_lord.htm">Joy in the Presence of the LORD</a></b><br>The joy experienced during Solomon's anointing is a reminder of the joy that comes from being in God's presence and following His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_anointing.htm">The Importance of Anointing</a></b><br>Anointing signifies God's choice and blessing.

Their feasting was more than a party&#8212;it was worship &#8220;in the presence of the LORD,&#8221; echoing commands to rejoice before Him with sacrifices and fellowship meals (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine joy arises when God&#8217;s people give freely and see His purposes advancing (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>). David had just prayed, &#8220;Everything comes from You&#8221; (1 Chron 29:14); the people now celebrate that truth.<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows the messianic banquet where redeemed believers will eat and drink with surpassing joy in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then, for a second time, they designated David&#8217;s son Solomon as king</b><p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s first anointing happened quickly in response to Adonijah&#8217;s coup (<a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32&#8211;40</a>). This second, public designation confirms that God&#8217;s choice&#8212;already announced in 1 Chron 28:5&#8211;7&#8212;has the united support of the nation.<p>&#8226; Scripture often records multiple confirmations of a God&#8211;given call: Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; 11:15) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; 5:3) were also anointed twice. Such repetition removes doubt and strengthens corporate commitment (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; By recognizing Solomon again, Israel acknowledges that the throne is established by divine covenant, not by human politics (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Anointing him before the LORD as ruler</b><p>&#8226; Anointing with oil marks someone set apart for sacred service (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Doing this &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; at Gibeon&#8217;s tabernacle (1 Chron 21:29) declares that Solomon reigns under God&#8217;s authority, not merely the people&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; Oil symbolizes the Spirit&#8217;s empowering. Just as Solomon was anointed, so believers are anointed by the Holy Spirit for their callings (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;ruler&#8221; reminds us that kingship is stewardship.

This latter expression is more forcible than the former. The <span class="cmt_word">second time</span> of making Solomon king is explained by <a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>. The statement that <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span> was anointed to be <span class="cmt_word">priest</span> must probably be understood to describe, either the re-anointing of him (just as "they made Solomon king the second time") on an occasion which particularly invited it; or an anointing which had not been before fully performed. This latter is, perhaps, an unlikely supposition; but at the same time, the fact of any previous ceremony of the kind does not happen to be narrated. Zadok had been joint priest with Abiatbar of the line of Ithamar (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>, 29; 19:11); but now he was anointed under circumstances of special publicity, and at a crisis of special interest, to supersede Abiathar. who had sided with Adonijah, and who was early to be removed altogether from the sacred office (<a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8, 32, 38, 44, 45</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
