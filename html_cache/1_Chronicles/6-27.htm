The name means "God is Father" or "My God is Father," reflecting a deep spiritual heritage. In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>, Eliab is part of the genealogical record of the Levites, who were set apart for religious duties in Israel. This lineage emphasizes the importance of maintaining a pure and dedicated priestly line, as the Levites were responsible for the tabernacle and later the temple services. Eliab's inclusion in this genealogy underscores the continuity of God's covenant with the Levites.<p><b>Jeroham his son</b><br>Jeroham, meaning "May he be compassionate," is another Levite in this genealogical record. The name suggests a hope or prayer for God's mercy and compassion, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. Jeroham's position in the genealogy highlights the transmission of religious duties and responsibilities through generations. This continuity is crucial for the preservation of Israel's worship practices and the teaching of the Law. Jeroham's lineage is also significant in the broader narrative of Israel's history, as it connects to the prophet Samuel, a key figure in the transition from the period of the judges to the monarchy.<p><b>and Elkanah his son</b><br>Elkanah, meaning "God has created" or "God has possessed," is a significant figure in the biblical narrative. He is best known as the father of Samuel, the last judge of Israel and a prophet who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. Elkanah's story is detailed in 1 Samuel, where he is depicted as a devout man who regularly worships at Shiloh. His faithfulness and dedication to God are exemplified in his support of his wife Hannah, whose prayer for a child results in the birth of Samuel. Elkanah's inclusion in this genealogy not only connects the priestly line but also foreshadows the coming of Samuel, who plays a pivotal role in God's plan for Israel. This connection highlights the theme of divine providence and the fulfillment of God's promises through specific family lines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliab.htm">Eliab</a></b><br>A descendant in the Levitical line, Eliab is part of the genealogy that traces the priestly lineage.

By naming Eliab, he shows that God preserved each generation exactly as promised to Levi (<a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliab&#8217;s appearance reminds readers that no link in God&#8217;s covenant chain is insignificant. Every name, even one that receives little narrative attention elsewhere, stands as living proof that &#8220;not one word&#8221; of God&#8217;s purposes fails (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a> identifies Heman&#8212;Samuel&#8217;s grandson&#8212;as &#8220;the son of Joel, the son of Samuel, the son of Elkanah,&#8221; confirming Eliab&#8217;s spot in this unbroken succession of temple singers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeroham his son</b><p>&#8226; Jeroham connects the largely unknown Eliab with the much-better-known Elkanah of <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.

The same family details appear in two separate books written centuries apart&#8212;evidence of divine preservation.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness is often seen in &#8220;ordinary&#8221; fathers like Jeroham who pass along obedience without ever stepping into the spotlight (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elkanah his son</b><p>&#8226; Elkanah is the husband of Hannah and the father of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>).
