These foreigners, often referred to as "sojourners" or "resident aliens," were people who lived among the Israelites but were not part of the covenant community. Historically, these individuals could have been remnants of the original Canaanite inhabitants or people from surrounding nations who settled in Israel. The inclusion of foreigners in the workforce for the temple construction reflects the broader biblical theme of God's plan involving all nations, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>, which speaks of foreigners joining themselves to the Lord.<p><b>from whom he appointed stonecutters</b><br>The appointment of stonecutters indicates the specialized labor required for the temple's construction. Stonecutting was a skilled trade, essential for creating the massive and precisely cut stones needed for the temple's foundation and structure. This task required expertise, suggesting that these foreigners possessed skills that were either not as prevalent among the Israelites or that their labor was more readily available. The use of skilled laborers from among the foreigners can be seen as a practical decision by David to ensure the temple was built to the highest standards.<p><b>to prepare finished stones for building the house of God</b><br>The preparation of finished stones signifies the meticulous planning and effort that went into constructing the temple, which was to be a dwelling place for God's presence among His people. The "house of God" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which David desired to build as a permanent place of worship, replacing the portable tabernacle. Although David was not permitted to build the temple himself due to his history as a warrior (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>), he made extensive preparations for its construction. The temple is a type of Christ, as it symbolizes God's presence with His people, a theme fulfilled in Jesus, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The careful preparation of the stones also echoes the New Testament imagery of believers being "living stones" built into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is preparing for the construction of the temple, a task that God has assigned to his son Solomon.

The Canaanite population are meant, who lived on sufferance under the Israelite dominion, and were liable to forced service if the government required it.
