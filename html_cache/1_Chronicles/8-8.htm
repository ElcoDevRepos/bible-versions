The mention of Moab is significant, as Moab was a neighboring nation east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel. The Moabites descended from Lot, Abraham's nephew, and were generally seen as outsiders to the covenant community of Israel. This phrase indicates that Shaharaim had a connection with Moab, possibly through marriage or residence, which was not uncommon given the intermingling of peoples in the region. The presence of his sons in Moab suggests a blending of cultures and possibly a strategic alliance or refuge during a time of conflict.<p><b>after he had divorced his wives Hushim and Baara</b><br>Divorce in ancient Israelite culture was permitted under certain circumstances, though it was not encouraged. The mention of Shaharaim divorcing his wives, Hushim and Baara, is notable because it reflects personal and familial dynamics that were part of the broader social and legal practices of the time. Hushim and Baara are not widely known figures, and their mention here may indicate their significance in Shaharaim's life or the narrative of his descendants. The act of divorce and subsequent relocation to Moab could suggest a period of personal upheaval or a strategic decision to start anew in a different land. This phrase also highlights the patriarchal nature of the society, where men's decisions significantly impacted the lives of their families.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaharaim.htm">Shaharaim</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Shaharaim is noted for having sons in Moab after divorcing his wives.

This is supported by the LXX. The emigration of the clan Shaharaim, from its old home in Geba of Benjamin is called a divorce, in the figurative style of these genealogies; just as the amalgamation of clans is marriage. <span class= "ital">Hushim,</span> in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-12.htm" title="Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the sons of Aher.">1Chronicles 7:12</a>, is a Benjamite clan.
