In the ancient Near East, spring was the typical season for military campaigns due to favorable weather and the availability of food supplies. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, as kings would often engage in battles after the winter months. The timing also reflects the agricultural cycle, as armies could be sustained by the new harvest.<p><b>Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the Ammonites</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, is a key military leader in Israel's history. The Ammonites were a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel. This phrase indicates a continuation of hostilities that began in <a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>, where the Ammonites had insulted David's envoys. The term "ravaged" suggests a thorough and destructive campaign, typical of ancient warfare, aimed at weakening the enemy's resources and morale.<p><b>He came to Rabbah and besieged it</b><br>Rabbah was the capital city of the Ammonites, located in modern-day Amman, Jordan. Archaeological evidence supports its significance as a fortified city. A siege was a common military tactic used to cut off supplies and force a city's surrender. This action is part of the broader narrative of Israel's expansion and consolidation of power under David's reign.<p><b>but David remained in Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase highlights a significant deviation from the norm, as kings typically led their armies into battle. David's decision to stay in Jerusalem is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the events in <a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>, where David's absence from the battlefield leads to his sin with Bathsheba. This moment foreshadows the personal and national consequences of David's actions.<p><b>And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it</b><br>Joab's successful attack on Rabbah demonstrates his military prowess and loyalty to David. The demolition of the city signifies a decisive victory for Israel, fulfilling God's promise of giving the land to His people. This victory also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate triumph over His enemies, symbolizing the complete and final victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David, though sometimes acting independently.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who, in this instance, stayed behind in Jerusalem instead of leading his troops into battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel, descendants of Lot, and frequently mentioned as adversaries in the Old Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabbah.htm">Rabbah</a></b><br>The capital city of the Ammonites, located in present-day Jordan, which was besieged and conquered by Joab.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where David remained during this military campaign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>David's decision to remain in Jerusalem while his army went to war highlights the importance of leadership presence.
