Genealogies served as a means to preserve the history and lineage of the tribes of Israel, ensuring that the promises made to the patriarchs were remembered and passed down through generations. The emphasis on clans underscores the communal and familial nature of Israelite society, where identity was closely tied to one's family and tribe.<p><b>Jeiel the chief:</b><br>Jeiel is noted as the chief, indicating a position of leadership or prominence within his clan. The role of a chief would involve responsibilities such as governance, military leadership, and religious duties. This reflects the tribal structure of ancient Israel, where leadership was often hereditary and based on family lineage. The mention of Jeiel as chief suggests he was a person of influence and authority, possibly involved in decision-making processes for his clan.<p><b>Zechariah:</b><br>Zechariah, a common name in the Old Testament, means "Yahweh remembers." This name is significant as it reflects the faithfulness of God in remembering His covenant with Israel. The presence of a Zechariah in this genealogy may also connect to the broader biblical theme of God's remembrance and faithfulness to His people. While this specific Zechariah is not detailed further in this passage, the name itself carries theological weight, reminding readers of God's ongoing relationship with His people throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeiel.htm">Jeiel</a></b><br>Identified as the chief among his relatives, Jeiel holds a position of leadership within his family.

God repeatedly frames His people in terms of family connections (<a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/acts/7-17.htm">Acts 7:17</a>).<p>- These relationships underline covenant continuity. Just as God knew Noah&#8217;s sons by name (<a href="/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>) and counted every household at the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>), He tracks each person here.<p>- The inclusion of &#8220;relatives&#8221; shows that God&#8217;s promises move through families, reinforcing what He declared to Abraham: &#8220;In you all the families of the earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by their clans</b><p>- &#8220;Clans&#8221; narrows the focus to sub-groups within the tribe, a structure first laid out during Israel&#8217;s wilderness census (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>; 26:5).<p>- This organization served practical purposes&#8212;assigning land, military duties, and worship roles (<a href="/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16&#8211;22</a>).<p>- Spiritually, it highlights accountability. Each clan knew its place, echoing Paul&#8217;s image of the church as a body with many parts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are recorded in their genealogy</b><p>- Chronicles repeatedly stresses written records (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a>). A written genealogy testified to legitimate inheritance and priestly or tribal rights (<a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>).<p>- God values accurate history. The same God who instructed Moses to &#8220;write this as a memorial&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>) inspires the Chronicler to preserve these names so future generations can trace His faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/78-6.htm">Psalm 78:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>- In the New Testament, Matthew and Luke mirror this concern by recording Jesus&#8217; lineage to prove His messianic credentials (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23&#8211;38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeiel the chief</b><p>- &#8220;Jeiel&#8221; is singled out as &#8220;the chief,&#8221; indicating recognized leadership within Reuben. Chiefs were responsible for guiding their people in battle and worship (<a href="/numbers/7-2.htm">Numbers 7:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>).<p>- His mention assures readers that Reuben still retained organized leadership even after losing the firstborn privilege (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>).<p>- God raises specific individuals to stand out for His purposes, just as He later elevated Jair over Gilead (<a href="/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>) and David over Israel (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-2.htm">1 Chronicles 11:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zechariah</b><p>- The listing of another notable, &#8220;Zechariah,&#8221; shows multiple leaders in the same generation, a safeguard against centralized failure (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>).<p>- Other faithful men named Zechariah appear in Scripture&#8212;one who helped Uzziah seek God (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>) and the father of John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5&#8211;6</a>). Each reflects God&#8217;s pattern of raising righteous witnesses.<p>- Placing Zechariah beside Jeiel illustrates the wisdom of shared leadership (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a>) and anticipates the New Testament model of a plurality of elders (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/5-7.htm">1 Chronicles 5:7</a> underscores that God tracks families, clans, and individual leaders with precision. The verse reassures us that every believer&#8217;s place is known to the Lord, leadership is ordained for order and blessing, and written records anchor God&#8217;s unfolding plan in verifiable history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Tilgath - pilneser.</span>--The Assyrian monarch known as Tiglath Pileser II.

The intimation, <span class="cmt_word">when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned</span>, is probably explained by the contents of ver. 17 (of which hereafter). Aroer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>); a place east of the Jordan, overhanging the torrent of Arnon, which was a boundary between Moab and the Amorites, and afterwards between Moab and Reuben. There is little doubt that Burckhardt has identified the ruins of <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span> (see <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24, 36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8, 12, 16</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-1.htm">Joshua 12:1, 2</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13, 26</a>, where note transposition of letters in the <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>). Moab seems to have regained it later (<a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1-47</a>; see interesting arts. "Amen" and "Areer," Smith's' Bible Dictionary'). <span class="cmt_word">Nebo</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>-<span class="cmt_word">meon</span> are also mentioned together in <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>; and Baal-meon with Moab in <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm">Ezekiel 25:9</a>. This Nebo, the <span class="accented">town</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> distinct from Mount Nebo. It is remarkable that it is not mentioned, unless under one of the "changed" names (<a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>), in the list of the towns of Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-23</a>). Nebo was the name of a heathen deity, known among the Chaldeans (<a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), Babylonians, and Assyrians; and this constituted one reason, if not the reason, for changing its name when it had been affixed to the Moabite city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His relatives</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
