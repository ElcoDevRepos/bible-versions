The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the lineage of the tribes of Israel, particularly focusing on the tribe of Judah, from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. The name Zabad means "gift" or "endowment," which may reflect the cultural importance of children as blessings from God. This lineage highlights the continuity of God's promises through generations. Zabad's mention here connects to the broader narrative of God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>Ephlal was the father of Obed</b><br>Ephlal is a less commonly mentioned figure, and his name means "judge" or "intercessor." This name may suggest a role or characteristic valued in the community, such as wisdom or leadership. The genealogical record continues to trace the line through which God's purposes unfold. Obed, the son of Ephlal, shares a name with a more prominent biblical figure, Obed, the grandfather of King David, though they are not the same individual. The name Obed means "servant" or "worshiper," reflecting a life dedicated to serving God. This connection to service and worship is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and devotion to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zabad.htm">Zabad</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Zabad is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Judah.
