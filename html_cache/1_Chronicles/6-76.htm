This tribe settled in the northern part of Canaan, an area known for its fertile land and strategic location. The allocation of land to the Levites from Naphtali signifies the tribe's role in supporting the religious and spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>they were given Kedesh in Galilee</b><br>Kedesh in Galilee was a significant Levitical city and one of the cities of refuge, as outlined in <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>. It was located in the region of Upper Galilee, which later became an important area in the ministry of Jesus Christ. The city served as a sanctuary for those who accidentally committed manslaughter, symbolizing the mercy and justice of God. The mention of Galilee also foreshadows the New Testament, where Galilee becomes central to Jesus' ministry.<p><b>Hammon</b><br>Hammon is less prominently mentioned in the Bible, but it was another city allocated to the Levites. Its exact location is not definitively known, but it is believed to have been in the region of Naphtali. The inclusion of Hammon highlights the distribution of Levitical cities throughout Israel, ensuring that the Levites could perform their priestly duties and teach the Law across the nation.<p><b>and Kiriathaim</b><br>Kiriathaim, like Hammon, is not frequently mentioned, and its precise location remains uncertain. However, its inclusion in the list of Levitical cities underscores the importance of providing for the Levites, who had no inheritance of their own. This provision allowed them to focus on their spiritual responsibilities without the burden of land ownership.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The mention of pasturelands indicates the practical needs of the Levites, who required land to support their livestock and sustain their families. This provision reflects God's care for the Levites, ensuring they had the necessary resources to live and serve. The allocation of pasturelands also emphasizes the integration of spiritual and practical life in Israel, where the Levites played a crucial role in maintaining the nation's covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_naphtali.htm">Tribe of Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and Bilhah.
