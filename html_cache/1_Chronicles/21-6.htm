However, he chose not to include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin. The Levites were traditionally exempt from military duties and censuses due to their priestly role (<a href="/numbers/1-47.htm">Numbers 1:47-53</a>). This reflects their unique position in Israelite society, dedicated to religious service and temple duties. Benjamin's exclusion is less clear, but it may relate to its proximity to Jerusalem and the tribe's historical tensions with other tribes (Judges 20). Joab's decision indicates his awareness of the spiritual and political implications of the census.<p><b>because the king&#8217;s command was detestable to him</b><br>Joab found King David's command to conduct the census detestable, suggesting a moral or spiritual objection. In the ancient Near Eastern context, censuses were often associated with military conscription or taxation, which could be seen as a lack of trust in God's provision and protection. Joab's resistance highlights a tension between royal authority and divine will. This act of counting the people was seen as an expression of pride or self-reliance, contrary to reliance on God. The narrative parallels the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16-20</a> against kings amassing power and wealth, emphasizing humility and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, tasked with conducting the census.

There is nothing in the style to suggest a later hand; while the word "counted" (<span class= "ital">p?qad</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which has not been used before in this chapter, occurs twice in the parallel passage (<a href="/2_samuel/24-2.htm" title="For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people, that I may know the number of the people.">2Samuel 24:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-4.htm" title="Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.">2Samuel 24:4</a>). It is noticeable also that the chronicler writes "the king" (not "David") here, as in Samuel.<p>As regards the fact stated, we may observe that the sacerdotal tribe of Levi would naturally be exempted from a census taken for military or political purposes. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/1-47.htm" title="But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.">Numbers 1:47</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-49.htm" title="Only you shall not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:">Numbers 1:49</a>.) And <a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm" title="Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.">1Chronicles 27:24</a> expressly asserts that the census was not completed; a result with which Joab's disapprobation of the scheme may have had much to do. The order in which the tribes were numbered (<a href="/context/2_samuel/24-4.htm" title="Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.">2Samuel 24:4-8</a>; see <a href="/1_chronicles/21-4.htm" title="Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Why Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 21:4</a>) makes it likely that Judah and Benjamin were to have been taken last, and that, after numbering Judah, Joab repaired to the capital, where he was ordered by the king to desist from the undertaking. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antiq. vii.</span> 13, 1) speaks as if Joab had not had time to include Benjamin in the census. He may have feared to give offence to the tribe of Saul. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Averse to his task as Joab was, he may have been indebted to the memory of the exemption of Levi from census for the idea of enlarging upon it and omitting Benjamin as well. The important contents of this short verse are not found in Samuel, so that we can borrow no light thence. But Benjamin was "the least of the tribes" (<a href="/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1-23</a>), and Peele has suggested that God would not permit the numbers of either of these tribes to be lessened, as he foresaw that they would be faithful to the throne of David on the division of the kingdom. Others think that the omission of these tribes in the census may have been due to Joab's recall to Jerusalem before the completion of the work, and to the king's repentance in the interim cutting off the necessity of completing it. This little agrees, however, with the resolute tone and assigned reason contained in this verse. Peele's explanation, meantime, explains nothing in respect of the statement that <span class="cmt_word">the king's word was abominable to Joab.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But [Joab] did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">include</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#257;&#183;qa&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6485.htm">Strong's 6485: </a> </span><span class="str2">To visit, to oversee, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Levi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;w&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
