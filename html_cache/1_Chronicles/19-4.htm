David had sent his servants to express condolences for Nahash's death, as Nahash had shown kindness to David. However, Hanun's advisors convinced him that David's servants were spies. This reflects the political tensions and mistrust between Israel and its neighbors. The act of taking David's servants was a hostile gesture, indicating a breach of diplomatic protocol and an affront to David's intentions.<p><b>shaved their beards</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, a man's beard was a symbol of dignity and honor. Shaving it was considered a severe insult and humiliation. This act by Hanun was not just a personal affront to the men but also an insult to David and Israel. The shaving of the beard is reminiscent of other biblical instances where humiliation is depicted, such as the treatment of prisoners or captives. It underscores the cultural significance of the beard as a marker of identity and respect.<p><b>cut off their garments at the hips</b><br>Cutting off the garments at the hips left the men exposed and humiliated. In the ancient world, clothing was a sign of status and identity. This act of cutting their garments was intended to disgrace them publicly. It parallels other biblical narratives where clothing is used to signify shame or honor, such as Joseph's coat of many colors or the prodigal son's robe. The act of exposing the servants was a deliberate attempt to shame David's representatives and, by extension, David himself.<p><b>and sent them away</b><br>Sending the servants away in such a state was a calculated move to send a message of defiance and disrespect to David. It was a declaration of enmity and a rejection of David's overtures of peace. This action set the stage for the ensuing conflict between Israel and the Ammonites, as recorded in the subsequent verses. The sending away of the servants echoes other biblical themes of rejection and exile, highlighting the consequences of broken relationships and the importance of honor and respect in diplomatic relations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanun.htm">Hanun</a></b><br>The new king of the Ammonites, who succeeded his father Nahash.

The verse signals more than personal disrespect; it sets in motion the subsequent conflict in which God vindicates His anointed. The passage reminds believers that dishonoring God&#8217;s servants is both a moral and spiritual offense, and that the Lord faithfully upholds the dignity of those who bear His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Shaved them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the half of their beards (Samuel).<p><span class= "bld">Hard by their buttocks.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">unto the extremities.</span> The chronicler has substituted a more decorous term for the one which appears in Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">Cut off their garments.</span>--To look like captives (<a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm" title="So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.">Isaiah 20:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The classical scholar will not fail to be reminded, so far as the <span class="cmt_word">shaving</span> here spoken of is concerned, of the account contained in Herodotus, 2:121.
