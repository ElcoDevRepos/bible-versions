The listing of Tola's sons highlights the importance of family lineage and leadership within the tribes of Israel. Each son is noted as a head of their family, indicating a position of authority and responsibility. This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where family heads played crucial roles in maintaining tribal identity and heritage. The names themselves, such as Uzzi (meaning "my strength") and Shemuel (meaning "heard of God"), may reflect the character or aspirations of the families.<p><b>In the days of David, 22,600 descendants of Tola were numbered in their genealogies as mighty men of valor.</b><br>This phrase situates the genealogy in the historical context of King David's reign, a time of consolidation and expansion for Israel. The numbering of 22,600 descendants as "mighty men of valor" underscores the military strength and capability of the tribe of Issachar. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where David's reign is marked by military campaigns and the establishment of a united kingdom. The term "mighty men of valor" is often used in the Old Testament to describe warriors of great courage and skill, such as David's own elite warriors (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>).

The Chronicler&#8217;s simple phrase, &#8220;The sons of Tola,&#8221; roots us in a literal family tree, reminding us that every generation matters to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Uzzi, Rephaiah, Jeriel, Jahmai, Ibsam, and Shemuel</b><p>Six names&#8212;ordinary men who became the taproots of sizable clans.
