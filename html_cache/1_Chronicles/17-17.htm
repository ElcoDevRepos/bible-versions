David acknowledges that what God has done for him is beyond human comprehension, yet it is a small thing for God. This highlights God's omnipotence and grace. In the broader biblical context, this sentiment is echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding. David's recognition of God's greatness is a recurring theme in the Psalms, which he authored, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the insignificance of human achievements in comparison.<p><b>You have spoken about the future of the house of Your servant</b><br>Here, the "house of Your servant" refers to the Davidic dynasty. God's promise to David is a covenant that his lineage will endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, as seen in the genealogies of <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. This promise is foundational to the messianic hope in the Old Testament, with prophetic connections to passages like <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises David an everlasting kingdom. The future of David's house is not just about his immediate descendants but points to the eternal kingdom established through Christ.<p><b>and have regarded me as a man of great distinction,</b><br>David is acknowledging the honor and favor God has bestowed upon him. Despite his humble beginnings as a shepherd, God elevated him to be king over Israel. This reflects the biblical theme of God choosing the lowly and exalting them, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. David's distinction is not based on his merit but on God's sovereign choice and grace. This also prefigures the way God exalts Jesus, who humbled Himself and was later exalted (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>).<p><b>O LORD God.</b><br>The use of "LORD God" here combines the covenant name of God, Yahweh, with the more general term for deity, Elohim. This emphasizes both God's personal relationship with David and His universal sovereignty. The covenant name Yahweh is significant in the context of God's promises, as it is the name by which God revealed Himself to Moses and the Israelites, signifying His faithfulness and unchanging nature (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>). David's use of this name underscores his recognition of God's covenantal faithfulness and the personal relationship he enjoys with the Almighty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, chosen by God, who is expressing his humility and gratitude for God's promises concerning his lineage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who makes a promise to David about the future of his house.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Nathan is the prophet through whom God delivers His message to David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_david.htm">House of David</a></b><br>Refers to the dynasty and lineage of David, which God promises to establish forever.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigns as king and where God establishes His covenant with David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_grace.htm">God's Sovereignty and Grace</a></b><br>God's promises are not based on human merit but on His sovereign grace.

The verse underscores God&#8217;s unrivaled power, His covenant faithfulness that reaches its climax in Christ, and His gracious habit of honoring the humble.

Elliptical as this reading may seem, there is no real difficulty in feeling its essential harmony with the passage before us. David's unfeigned surprise and joy in the "<span class="cmt_word">great while to come"</span> nature of the promises made to him and his house overpower all else in his estimation. It is, indeed, a most opportune emphasis that he lays upon this element of the full promise, and accords exceptionally well with our later knowledge and brighter light. Our Authorized Version rendering throws out sufficiently this surprise, and gives not inadequately the drift of the passage. The continuity and exaltedness of the promise, which was only fully realized in the greater Son of David, the Christ, might well astonish David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/17-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as if this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was a small thing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1448;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;&#7789;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
