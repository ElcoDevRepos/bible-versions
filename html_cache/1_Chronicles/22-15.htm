In the context of ancient Israel, having a large workforce was crucial for undertaking such a monumental project. The preparation for the temple was extensive, and King David ensured that Solomon had all the necessary resources. This reflects the importance of community and collective effort in fulfilling God's plans. The gathering of workers can be seen as a type of the church, where many members with diverse gifts come together to build the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>stonecutters, masons, carpenters,</b><br>These specific tradesmen were essential for the construction of the temple. Stonecutters and masons were responsible for preparing the stones, which were quarried and shaped to fit perfectly without the sound of tools at the temple site (<a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>). This meticulous preparation signifies the holiness and reverence associated with the temple. Carpenters were needed for the woodwork, including the construction of beams, doors, and other wooden elements. The use of skilled laborers underscores the temple's significance as a dwelling place for God, requiring the best craftsmanship.<p><b>and men skilled in every kind of work&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the diversity of skills required for the temple's construction. It suggests that God values and utilizes a variety of talents and abilities to accomplish His purposes. The temple project required not only physical labor but also artistic and technical skills, as seen in the detailed descriptions of the temple's furnishings and decorations (1 Kings 6-7). This diversity of skills can be compared to the spiritual gifts given to believers, each contributing uniquely to the church's mission (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-8</a>). The preparation and organization reflect God's order and provision, ensuring that every aspect of the temple was crafted with excellence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is preparing for the construction of the temple.

It underscores personal responsibility&#8212;Solomon is not a passive heir but an active participant (see <a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the church today (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>), believers are invited to join God&#8217;s work, not merely observe it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have many workers</b><p>&#8220;You also have many workers&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

any skew weakens the whole (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s listing honors even those whose names history forgets, illustrating that every role counts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>carpenters</b><p>&#8220;carpenters&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;
