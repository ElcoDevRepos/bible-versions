The role of an armor-bearer was to assist a warrior in battle, carrying his weapons and providing support. This relationship was one of trust and loyalty, reflecting the close bond between a king and his servant. The presence of an armor-bearer highlights the hierarchical military structure of ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Draw your sword and run me through with it,</b><br>Saul's request to his armor-bearer to kill him indicates his desire to avoid capture and humiliation by the Philistines. This act of asking for assisted death reflects the ancient Near Eastern honor-shame culture, where dying at the hands of one's enemies was considered disgraceful. Saul's request also shows his desperation and loss of hope, contrasting with the faith and courage expected of Israel's king.<p><b>or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!&#8221;</b><br>The term "uncircumcised" is used to describe the Philistines, emphasizing their status as non-Israelites and covenant outsiders. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, and calling the Philistines "uncircumcised" underscores their opposition to God's people. Saul's fear of torture reflects the brutal practices of ancient warfare, where captured leaders often faced severe humiliation and death.<p><b>But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it.</b><br>The armor-bearer's fear may stem from reverence for the king, fear of divine retribution, or personal moral conviction. His refusal to kill Saul highlights the sanctity of the king's life and the seriousness of taking such an action. This moment of hesitation contrasts with the loyalty expected of an armor-bearer, showing the complexity of human emotions in dire situations.<p><b>So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</b><br>Saul's decision to commit suicide marks a tragic end to his reign, characterized by disobedience and decline. This act of falling on his sword is a common method of suicide in ancient times, symbolizing a final attempt to maintain control over one's fate. Saul's death fulfills the prophecy of his downfall due to his disobedience to God (<a href="/1_samuel/28-17.htm">1 Samuel 28:17-19</a>). It also serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's guidance, contrasting with the hope and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who offers life and victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Each clause shows the consequences of a life that drifted from obedience: fear replaces faith, honor replaces repentance, and self-reliance replaces trust in God.

He refused the request or bidding of Saul, no doubt mainly in respect of the fact that Saul was still "the anointed." We have a full description of both the loose arms and of the armour of the body in the case of the Philistine Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4-7</a>). It is one of the world's surprising facts that the making of arms and armour, and the acquiring of skill in the using of them, should, as in fact all history attests, date from so early a period (<a href="/genesis/31-26.htm">Genesis 31:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>). As compared with the history and the fragmentary re. mains of classical antiquity, those of Scripture are remarkably scanty on this subject.

Then follows the spear in several varieties, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a>.
