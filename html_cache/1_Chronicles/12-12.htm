The name means "Yahweh is gracious," reflecting a common theme in Hebrew names that emphasize God's attributes. In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>, Johanan is listed among the mighty men who joined David at Ziklag. This period was a time of transition and consolidation for David as he gathered support to establish his rule over Israel. The mention of Johanan as the "eighth" suggests a structured order among the warriors, indicating a well-organized group. This organization reflects the military precision and loyalty that David inspired among his followers, which was crucial for his eventual success as king.<p><b>Elzabad the ninth</b><br>Elzabad, meaning "God has given," is another warrior listed among David's supporters. The designation as the "ninth" again points to the ordered arrangement of these men, highlighting the importance of each individual's role within the group. Elzabad's inclusion in this list underscores the diverse backgrounds of those who rallied to David's cause, as these men came from various tribes and regions. This diversity is significant, as it prefigures the unification of Israel under David's leadership. The gathering of these warriors can be seen as a type of the gathering of believers to Christ, who unites people from all walks of life into one body. The loyalty and dedication of these men to David foreshadow the commitment expected of followers of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan.htm">Johanan</a></b><br>Mentioned as the eighth in the list of warriors who joined David at Ziklag.

Every detail is inspired, so even a brief mention carries weight.<p>&#8226; Order matters. Being listed eighth shows structured leadership among the eleven Gadite captains who &#8220;had faces like lions and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains&#8221; (12:8). God is not vague; He numbers and assigns (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Courage is assumed. These Gadites &#8220;crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks&#8221; (12:15). Johanan willingly risked everything to stand with David, the anointed king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Loyalty over convenience.

The Gadites &#8220;were the least a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand&#8221; (12:14).
