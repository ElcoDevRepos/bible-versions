It is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>) and the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-21</a>). In this context, casting lots ensured that the distribution of duties among the musicians was fair and divinely guided, reflecting a trust in God's sovereignty over the roles assigned. This practice underscores the belief that God is involved in the details of worship and service.<p><b>young and old alike</b><br>This phrase highlights the inclusivity and equality in the service of the temple. Both the young and the old were given responsibilities, indicating that age was not a barrier to serving God. This reflects the biblical principle that God values the contributions of all His people, regardless of age. It also suggests a mentoring relationship, where the older, more experienced individuals could guide and support the younger ones, fostering a community of learning and growth.<p><b>teacher as well as pupil</b><br>The mention of both teacher and pupil emphasizes the importance of education and discipleship in the service of God. It suggests a structured system where knowledge and skills were passed down from one generation to the next. This mirrors the biblical model of discipleship seen in the relationship between Paul and Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>) and Jesus and His disciples. It also points to the value of humility and the willingness to learn, as even teachers were subject to the same process of selection and service as their pupils.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places
