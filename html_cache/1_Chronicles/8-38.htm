The listing of his sons emphasizes the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite culture. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to establish identity and continuity of God's people, linking past promises to future fulfillment.<p><b>Azrikam,</b><br>The name Azrikam means "help against the enemy" or "my help has risen." Names in the Bible often reflect character or destiny. Azrikam's name suggests a role of protection or leadership, possibly indicating his family's hope for deliverance or strength through him.<p><b>Bocheru,</b><br>Bocheru is a less common name, and its meaning is uncertain, though it may relate to "firstborn" or "youth." This could imply a position of prominence or expectation within the family, as firstborn sons often held special status in biblical times.<p><b>Ishmael,</b><br>Ishmael means "God hears." This name is significant in biblical history, as it recalls the Ishmael of Genesis, Abraham's son by Hagar. The repetition of this name in different contexts highlights God's attentiveness to His people and their prayers.<p><b>Sheariah,</b><br>Sheariah means "valued by the Lord" or "the Lord is my kinsman." This name underscores the personal relationship between God and His people, reflecting a sense of belonging and divine favor.<p><b>Obadiah,</b><br>Obadiah means "servant of the Lord." This name is shared by several biblical figures, including a minor prophet. It signifies devotion and service to God, a central theme in the lives of those who follow Him.<p><b>and Hanan.</b><br>Hanan means "gracious" or "merciful." This name reflects the character of God, who is often described as gracious and merciful throughout Scripture. It may also indicate the family's hope for God's grace upon them.<p><b>All these were the sons of Azel.</b><br>The repetition of Azel's name and the mention of his sons collectively emphasize the importance of family and legacy. In biblical genealogies, the preservation of family lines is crucial for maintaining the covenant promises God made to His people. This passage connects Azel's family to the broader narrative of Israel's history and God's unfolding plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azel.htm">Azel</a></b><br>A descendant of King Saul, Azel is noted for having six sons.
