It reflects a posture of prayer and submission, acknowledging God's sovereignty. The use of "O LORD" is significant as it invokes the covenant name of God, Yahweh, which is central to Israel's understanding of God as the eternal, self-existent One who is faithful to His promises.<p><b>let the word You have spoken</b><br>David refers to the divine promise given to him through the prophet Nathan. This promise is part of the Davidic Covenant, where God assures David that his lineage will endure forever. The "word" signifies God's authoritative declaration, which is unchangeable and reliable. This highlights the importance of prophecy in the biblical narrative, where God's spoken word is seen as a binding commitment.<p><b>concerning Your servant and his house</b><br>David humbly refers to himself as God's "servant," a term that denotes loyalty and submission to God's will. The "house" refers not only to David's immediate family but also to his royal dynasty. This promise has both immediate and long-term implications, as it points to the establishment of David's kingdom and ultimately to the coming of the Messiah, who would be a descendant of David.<p><b>be established forever.</b><br>The concept of an eternal dynasty is central to the Davidic Covenant. This promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament. The term "forever" underscores the eternal nature of God's promises and His unchanging faithfulness. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's eternal kingdom, which is a recurring motif throughout Scripture.<p><b>Do as You have promised,</b><br>David's request for God to fulfill His promise demonstrates his faith and trust in God's word. It reflects a deep understanding of God's character as one who is faithful and true. This phrase also serves as a model for prayer, where believers are encouraged to remind God of His promises and to trust in His timing and methods. The fulfillment of God's promises is a testament to His sovereignty and His plan for redemption through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God, who desired to build a temple for the Lord.
