The mention of his brother Shuhah suggests a family of some significance, though little is known about them outside of this passage. The genealogies in Chronicles often highlight lesser-known individuals, emphasizing the importance of every member in the lineage of Israel. This reflects the biblical theme that God values each person, regardless of their prominence. The name Chelub may be related to Caleb, a more prominent figure, though they are distinct individuals. Shuhah is not mentioned elsewhere, indicating that the chronicler's focus is on establishing lineage rather than detailing personal achievements.<p><b>was the father of Mehir</b><br>Mehir is another figure about whom little is known outside of this genealogy. The chronicler's inclusion of Mehir underscores the importance of family lines in the biblical narrative, particularly in the context of the tribes of Israel. The genealogies serve to connect the post-exilic community to their ancestral roots, reinforcing their identity and continuity as God's chosen people. The name Mehir means "price" or "reward," which may reflect cultural values or expectations placed upon him or his descendants.<p><b>who was the father of Eshton</b><br>Eshton, like his predecessors, is not widely mentioned in other biblical texts. His inclusion in the genealogy serves to trace the lineage and heritage of the tribe of Judah, to which these individuals belong. The genealogies in Chronicles often serve to affirm the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, particularly the promise of a lasting heritage. Eshton's name means "effort" or "labor," which could symbolize the toil and perseverance required to maintain the family line and uphold the covenantal promises. This lineage, though not directly linked to major biblical events, contributes to the broader tapestry of Israel's history and God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kelub.htm">Kelub</a></b><br>Mentioned as the brother of Shuhah, Kelub is a lesser-known figure in the genealogies of Judah.

Chronicles often links siblings to distinguish between people with similar names (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-5.htm">1 Chronicles 4:5</a>; 7:1).<p>- Sibling references testify that individual lives are intertwined in God&#8217;s purposes. Think of Moses and Aaron (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14</a>) or Mary and Martha (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>): God works through families, not isolated heroes.<p>- Including Shuhah also tells us that both men and women shape redemptive history (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/4-18.htm">1 Chronicles 4:18</a> where a mother&#8217;s name is noted).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was the father of Mehir</b><p>- &#8220;was the father of&#8221; signals the transfer of covenant blessing from one generation to the next (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>).<p>- Mehir&#8217;s name appears only here, yet his existence mattered. In God&#8217;s economy, faithfulness in hidden places is recorded forever (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p>- By anchoring Mehir to Chelub, the text teaches that spiritual heritage is received, not self-generated (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was the father of Eshton</b><p>- The chain continues: Mehir &#8220;was the father of Eshton.&#8221; Chronicles will soon mention Eshton&#8217;s sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-12.htm">1 Chronicles 4:12</a>), showing momentum toward future generations.<p>- Each link points forward to the ultimate descendant from Judah&#8212;Jesus the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-3</a>). Even obscure ancestors contribute to that unfolding line.<p>- The pattern highlights God&#8217;s patience: He advances His plan through centuries of births, lives, and deaths, unwavering in His promise (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/4-11.htm">1 Chronicles 4:11</a>, though brief, upholds the trustworthiness of Scripture&#8217;s genealogies and showcases God&#8217;s meticulous care for every individual in His covenant family. Chelub, his sibling Shuhah, his son Mehir, and grandson Eshton stand as reminders that the Lord weaves each life into His larger redemption story, passing His blessings from generation to generation until they culminate in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11-12) A fragment relating to the "men of Rechah," a name which occurs nowhere else, and for which Rechab appears a plausible correction.

Hence it is likely that the Chelub of <a href="/1_chronicles/4-11.htm" title="And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton.">1Chronicles 4:11</a> is identical with the Caleb-Chelubai of 1 Chronicles 2, who represents a main division of the Hezronites. Others suppose that the epithet, "brother of Shuah" (Shuhah), is meant to obviate this identification. The other names in this short section are wholly unknown. But their form shows at once that Beth-rapha and Ir-nahash (serpent city) are towns.<p><span class= "bld">Paseah</span> (lame; comp.

The suggestion of Grove, in his art. "Ir-enahash" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), is worth notice, that possibly the versos may be a reminiscence of some Canaanitish graft on Judah - the Shuah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 11 pointing to the Shua (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>)of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-2.htm">Genesis 38:2</a>. Beth-rapha (the house of the giant) looks more like the name of a place than of a person, though the text needs a person, and such may be covered possibly by this name, though it be of a place. Ir-nahash (the city of the serpent). Jerome, in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae in Parah,' asserts or repeats the assertion of some one else that this is no other place than Bethlehem; taking Nahash as a synonym with Jesse. Unlikely as this is, no place of the name is known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Kelub</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#363;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
