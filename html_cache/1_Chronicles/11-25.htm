These warriors were renowned for their bravery and skill in battle. The individual mentioned here, likely referring to Benaiah, was highly esteemed among this group, indicating his exceptional valor and leadership. The Thirty were a select group, and being the most honored among them suggests a status of great respect and recognition. This reflects the biblical theme of God honoring those who are faithful and courageous, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>.<p><b>but he did not become one of the Three</b><br>The "Three" refers to an even more elite group within David's mighty men, known for their extraordinary feats. The distinction between the Thirty and the Three highlights a hierarchy of honor and achievement. Although Benaiah was highly honored, he did not attain the status of the Three, who were known for their unparalleled acts of heroism. This distinction underscores the idea that while many are called to serve, not all achieve the same level of recognition or responsibility, a concept echoed in the New Testament with the varying roles within the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-31</a>).<p><b>And David appointed him over his guard</b><br>David's appointment of this individual over his guard signifies a position of trust and responsibility. The guard was likely a personal bodyguard or a group responsible for the king's safety, indicating that David had great confidence in his abilities and loyalty. This appointment reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and the importance of placing trustworthy individuals in positions of authority. It also foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd, who guards and protects His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>). The historical context of David's reign, marked by military campaigns and the need for security, further emphasizes the significance of this role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and leadership.

David rewarded that mix of courage and humility by making him guardian of the royal person&#8212;a role that grew into even greater responsibility.
