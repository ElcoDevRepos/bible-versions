This responsibility underscores the importance of order and reverence in worship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>, where God provides detailed instructions for the tabernacle's construction and its furnishings.

Oil was used for anointing and as a component in offerings (<a href="/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24-25</a>), symbolizing the Holy Spirit's presence and consecration. Frankincense, a costly and fragrant resin, was burned as incense (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>), representing prayers ascending to God (<a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). Spices were used in the sacred anointing oil and incense, signifying the beauty and holiness of worship.
