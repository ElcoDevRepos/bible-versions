This phrase indicates a strong moral conviction, showing David's awareness of the gravity of the actions taken by his men. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/2_samuel/23-17.htm">2 Samuel 23:17</a>, where David also refuses to drink water obtained at great risk, demonstrating his humility and respect for the sacrifices of others.<p><b>How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "drink the blood" is a metaphorical expression, emphasizing the value of the lives of the men who obtained the water. In ancient Near Eastern culture, blood symbolized life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and David's refusal to drink the water equates to a refusal to benefit from the potential loss of life. This highlights the sacrificial nature of the act and David's recognition of the men's bravery and loyalty.<p><b>Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives,</b><br>This phrase underscores the perilous nature of the mission undertaken by David's men. The historical context involves the Philistine occupation of Bethlehem, making the retrieval of water a dangerous task. The loyalty and courage of these men are reminiscent of the dedication seen in other biblical figures who risked their lives for God's purposes, such as Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p><b>David refused to drink it.</b><br>David's refusal is an act of honor and respect, acknowledging the extreme risk his men took. This decision reflects his leadership qualities and his ability to value the lives of his followers over personal desires. It also serves as a type of Christ, who would later sacrifice Himself for others, valuing their lives above His own (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p><b>Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</b><br>The "three mighty men" refers to a group of elite warriors who were renowned for their bravery and loyalty to David. Their exploits are detailed in the surrounding passages, highlighting their significant role in David's military successes. This phrase serves to commemorate their heroism and dedication, drawing parallels to the valor and faithfulness expected of believers in spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his leadership qualities.
