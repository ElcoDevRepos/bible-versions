Chariots were a significant military asset in ancient warfare, symbolizing power and technological advancement. The capture of a thousand chariots indicates a substantial victory over the enemy, likely the Arameans, as mentioned in the broader context of <a href="/1_chronicles/18.htm">1 Chronicles 18</a>. This victory demonstrates God's favor upon David, fulfilling the promise of establishing his kingdom.<p><b>seven thousand charioteers</b><br>The capture of seven thousand charioteers underscores the scale of the victory. Charioteers were skilled warriors, and their capture would have been a significant blow to the enemy's military capabilities. This detail emphasizes the completeness of David's triumph and the weakening of his adversaries, aligning with God's plan to establish Israel as a dominant power in the region.<p><b>and twenty thousand foot soldiers</b><br>The mention of twenty thousand foot soldiers further illustrates the magnitude of the victory. Foot soldiers formed the backbone of ancient armies, and their capture would have severely diminished the enemy's ability to wage war. This overwhelming victory is a testament to David's leadership and God's providence, as seen in other biblical accounts of Israel's military successes.<p><b>and he hamstrung all the horses</b><br>Hamstringing horses was a common practice in ancient warfare to incapacitate them without killing. This action prevented the enemy from quickly rebuilding their chariot forces. It reflects David's strategic foresight and adherence to God's instructions, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, where kings of Israel were advised not to multiply horses for themselves, ensuring reliance on God rather than military might.<p><b>except a hundred he kept for the chariots</b><br>By keeping a hundred horses, David maintained a limited chariot force for his own use. This decision reflects a balance between military necessity and obedience to divine commands. It also symbolizes restraint and trust in God's provision, as David did not seek to amass excessive military power, aligning with the biblical principle of relying on God rather than human strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and his heart for God.
