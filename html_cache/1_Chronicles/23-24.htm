Their lineage traces back to Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah. The Levites were divided into three main families: the Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites, each with specific roles in the tabernacle service. This division highlights the importance of family lineage in maintaining religious and cultural traditions in ancient Israel.<p><b>the heads of families, registered individually by name&#8212;</b><br>The practice of registering individuals by name underscores the importance of order and accountability in the service of God. This meticulous record-keeping reflects the organizational structure necessary for the administration of temple duties. It also emphasizes the personal responsibility of each Levite in fulfilling their God-given roles, a principle that resonates with the New Testament teaching on the body of Christ, where each member has a specific function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>those twenty years of age or older who worked in the service of the house of the LORD.</b><br>Originally, the age for Levitical service was set at thirty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>), but David lowered it to twenty, possibly due to the increased responsibilities with the establishment of the temple. This change indicates a shift in the religious practices as Israel transitioned from a nomadic to a more settled society. The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple, a central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence among His people.

Descendants of Levi, rooted in families, led by responsible heads, named one by one, mature enough at twenty, all stepped into practical, ongoing ministry. The verse showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant, the value He places on ordered worship, and the honor of serving Him with both heritage and heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">These were the sons of Levi, according to their father-houses</span> (clans), <span class= "ital">heads of the houses</span> (fathers, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> father-houses), <span class= "ital">to those mustered of them, in an enumeration of names according to their polls.</span> This is the subscription to the foregoing list of names of the Levitical houses, as entered in the muster-rolls of David.<p><span class= "bld">As they were counted.</span>--<a href="/numbers/1-21.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-14.htm" title="Every one that passes among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.">Exodus 30:14</a>.

(On the present verse comp. <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1-3, 21-23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-26</a>.) It is not easy to reconcile this verse with ver. 3. Keil cuts the knot at once by supposing the "thirty" years of ver. 3 to be the error of a copyist, to whose memory the Mosaic census was present. And with Bertheau, he objects to the supposition that this verse describes a supplementary census, in conformity with "David's last words" (ver. 27), and as contrasted with his former directions. With the exception of what is contained in vers. 25-27, it is true that these do not offer themselves sufficient indications to make one feel confident of this explanation. On the other hand, to set down the number "thirty" in ver. 3 at once to the mistake of a copyist is too summary and convenient a way of escaping an awkward difficulty. It is evident that the following three verses do purport to explain why at this time the age of allowable service was altered to a standard so much lower than of old, and to assert that this alteration was recognized by the last orders of David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were the descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Levi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;w&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3878.htm">Strong's 3878: </a> </span><span class="str2">Levi -- a son of Jacob, also the tribe descended from him</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by their families&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
