Benjamin held a unique position as the tribe of Israel's first king, Saul. This connection to Saul is significant, as it highlights the tribal loyalty and familial ties that were prevalent in ancient Israel. The Benjaminites were known for their warrior skills, as seen in <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, where they are described as skilled archers and slingers. The mention of Saul's kinsmen underscores the political and familial dynamics at play during David's rise to power.<p><b>3,000:</b><br>The number 3,000 indicates a substantial group of warriors from the tribe of Benjamin who joined David. This figure reflects the significant support David was garnering, even from those who had previously been aligned with Saul. In the context of ancient Israel, numbers often held symbolic meaning, and large numbers like this could signify completeness or divine blessing. The presence of such a large contingent from Benjamin suggests a shift in allegiance and the growing acceptance of David as the rightful king.<p><b>most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time:</b><br>This phrase highlights the loyalty that the Benjaminites had to Saul's house, which was expected given their tribal affiliation. The loyalty to Saul's house is a testament to the strong tribal bonds and the initial resistance to David's kingship. However, the fact that they eventually joined David indicates a turning point in Israel's history, where the divine anointing of David as king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) began to be recognized more broadly. This shift also reflects the fulfillment of God's plan for David to unite the tribes of Israel under his rule, as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>. The transition of loyalty from Saul to David can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, from the line of David, would later unite all believers under His eternal kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for their fierce warriors and loyalty.

Benjamin sat between Judah and Ephraim, often acting as a bridge&#8212;and at times a buffer&#8212;between rival factions (<a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8&#8211;10</a>). By naming the tribe, the chronicler highlights:<p>&#8226; A prophetic thread&#8212;Jacob foretold Benjamin would be a &#8220;ravenous wolf&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>), a picture of warrior strength fulfilled in these soldiers.<p>&#8226; A relational connection&#8212;David, from Judah, is now receiving help from a tribe historically aligned with Saul, revealing God&#8217;s hand moving beyond tribal loyalties (<a href="/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the kinsmen of Saul</b><p>Calling them &#8220;kinsmen of Saul&#8221; underscores the potential cost of their decision. These men were related&#8212;by blood, clan, or long-standing allegiance&#8212;to the former king. Remaining with David could be seen as betraying family honor (<a href="/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8&#8211;9</a>). Their shift signals:<p>&#8226; A recognition that God had transferred the kingdom to David (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-9.htm">2 Samuel 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; A courageous break from human tradition to follow divine appointment (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>3,000</b><p>The number &#8220;3,000&#8221; conveys both strength and limitation. Compared with Judah&#8217;s 6,800 warriors (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-24.htm">1 Chronicles 12:24</a>) it is smaller, reflecting Benjamin&#8217;s hesitancy; yet it is sizable enough to matter in unifying the nation. God often works through a remnant (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>), showing:<p>&#8226; Commitment&#8212;thousands risked leaving Saul&#8217;s house.<p>&#8226; Catalyst&#8212;their presence helped persuade the rest of Israel to rally to David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>most had remained loyal to the house of Saul</b><p>This phrase explains why the Benjamite contingent is not larger. Up to this point many Benjamites still supported Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s surviving son (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>; 3:6&#8211;7). Loyalty, while admirable, can become misplaced when God has clearly moved on (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13&#8211;14</a>). The chronicler gently contrasts:<p>&#8226; Earthly allegiance&#8212;to a fading dynasty.<p>&#8226; Heavenly allegiance&#8212;to the Lord&#8217;s anointed, David (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70&#8211;71</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>up to that time</b><p>&#8220;Up to that time&#8221; marks a turning point.

Key lessons surface:<p>&#8226; Seasons change&#8212;God&#8217;s purposes advance in identifiable phases (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience isn&#8217;t static&#8212;once God&#8217;s direction is clear, delay risks missing His blessing (<a href="/2_samuel/5-12.htm">2 Samuel 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Unity follows surrender&#8212;when personal or tribal agendas yield to God&#8217;s plan, genuine unity emerges (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/12-29.htm">1 Chronicles 12:29</a> shows a strategic remnant from Saul&#8217;s own tribe crossing over to David. Their step of faith illustrates God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration: He raises leaders, realigns loyalties, and unifies His people in His timing. The verse calls readers to discern when a cherished allegiance must give way to wholehearted commitment to the Lord&#8217;s chosen path, trusting that His purposes will always prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Kindred.</span>--Fellow-tribesmen.<p><span class= "bld">Hitherto.</span>--<span class= "ital">Up to that time.</span> (Comp., same phrase, <a href="/1_chronicles/9-18.htm" title="Who till now waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.">1Chronicles 9:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Had kept.</span>--<span class= "ital">Were still keeping guard over the house of Saul</span>.

The Benjamites, as a whole, were still jealously guarding the interests of their own royal house. This remark, as well as the preceding expression, "Saul's fellow-tribesmen," is intended to explain the comparative smallness of the contingent from Benjamin. The tribe's reluctance to recognise David survived the murder of Ish-bosheth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Had kept the ward</span>; rather, had <span class="accented">kept on the side of</span>; the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">adhuc sequebatur.</span> The proposed translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> by "still" ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) is very doubtful.
