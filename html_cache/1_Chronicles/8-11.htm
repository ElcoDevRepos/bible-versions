Hushim is mentioned as the wife of Shaharaim, a descendant of Benjamin. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the lineage and heritage of the tribes of Israel, emphasizing the importance of family and tribal connections in Israelite society. The mention of Hushim highlights the role of women in the continuation of family lines, even though they are less frequently named in genealogies. This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite culture, where lineage was typically traced through the male line.<p><b>Abitub and Elpaal.</b><br>Abitub and Elpaal are listed as sons of Shaharaim and Hushim. The naming of these sons contributes to the chronicler's purpose of documenting the descendants of Benjamin, which is crucial for understanding the tribal allocations and inheritances in Israel. The names themselves, like many in the Bible, may carry meanings that reflect the character or hopes of the parents. Abitub could be interpreted as "father of goodness," while Elpaal might mean "God has made." These names reflect the theocentric worldview of the Israelites, where names often acknowledged God's role in their lives. The genealogical records in Chronicles also serve to connect the post-exilic community to their ancestral roots, reinforcing their identity and continuity as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushim.htm">Hushim</a></b><br>A wife of Shaharaim, mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin.
