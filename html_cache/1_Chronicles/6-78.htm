Reuben's tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan River, which was a decision made during the time of Moses (Numbers 32). This location was chosen because of its suitability for livestock, which was a primary occupation of the Reubenites. The tribe's history is marked by a lack of significant leadership and influence compared to other tribes, fulfilling Jacob's prophecy in <a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a> about Reuben's instability.<p><b>east of the Jordan</b><br>The phrase "east of the Jordan" refers to the Transjordan region, which includes the territories of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. This area was conquered by the Israelites before they crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land (Numbers 32). The Transjordan was known for its fertile land and strategic location, serving as a buffer zone against eastern invaders. It also held significant trade routes, contributing to the economic stability of the tribes residing there.<p><b>opposite Jericho</b><br>Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and was the first city conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 6). Its location opposite the Jordan River made it a key entry point into Canaan. The mention of Jericho highlights the geographical proximity of the Reubenite territory to this significant city, emphasizing the strategic importance of their land.<p><b>they were given Bezer in the wilderness</b><br>Bezer was designated as one of the cities of refuge, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a> and <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>. These cities provided asylum for individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter, offering them protection from the avenger of blood. The location "in the wilderness" suggests a remote area, which aligns with the purpose of a city of refuge being accessible yet isolated enough to ensure safety and justice.<p><b>Jahzah</b><br>Jahzah, also known as Jahaz, was a city in the territory of Reuben. It is historically significant as the site of a major battle where the Israelites, led by Moses, defeated King Sihon of the Amorites (<a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23-24</a>). This victory was crucial for the Israelites as it secured their passage into the Promised Land. The city's mention here underscores its importance in Israel's military and spiritual history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_reuben.htm">Tribe of Reuben</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Reuben, the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah.
