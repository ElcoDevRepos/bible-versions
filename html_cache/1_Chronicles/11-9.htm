David's growth in greatness is not merely a result of his own abilities but is attributed to divine favor. Historically, David's ascent began with his anointing by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) and continued through his military successes and leadership skills. His greatness is also seen in his ability to unite the tribes of Israel, establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center. This growth can be compared to the parable of the mustard seed in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>), symbolizing the kingdom of God starting small and expanding greatly.<p><b>for the LORD of Hosts was with him</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority. This divine presence with David is a recurring theme in his life, as seen in his victories over Goliath (1 Samuel 17) and his success in uniting Israel. The phrase indicates that David's success is not due to human effort alone but is a result of God's active involvement and blessing. This divine accompaniment is a foreshadowing of the presence of God with Jesus Christ, who is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>). The LORD's presence with David also fulfills the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, ensuring the establishment of a kingdom that would ultimately lead to the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is anointed king over Israel and is known for his heart after God.

Assur, the supreme deity of the Assyrian Pantheon, is called in the inscriptions "king of the legions of heaven and earth," or "of the great gods." Similar titles were given to the Babylonian Nebo and Merodach. The Hebrew phrase is therefore, in one sense, equivalent to a concise assertion of the statement, "Jehovah your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords" (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm" title="For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:">Deuteronomy 10:17</a> : comp. also <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm" title="For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.">Psalm 95:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>).
