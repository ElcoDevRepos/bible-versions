This fear was prompted by the death of Uzzah, who was struck down by God for touching the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9-10</a>). The incident underscores the importance of following God's instructions precisely, as outlined in the Law of Moses regarding the handling of the Ark (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). David's fear is not merely terror but a recognition of God's majesty and the seriousness of His commands.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?&#8221;</b><br>David's question reveals his desire to have the Ark, which symbolized God's presence, in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel. The Ark had been at Kiriath-jearim for many years (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>), and David wanted to restore it to a place of prominence. His question also indicates a moment of introspection and humility, acknowledging his need for divine guidance. This reflects a broader biblical theme of seeking God's will and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. David's inquiry foreshadows the eventual successful transport of the Ark, which was done according to God's instructions (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 13</a>-15), highlighting the importance of obedience and reverence in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
