David, despite being a powerful king, acknowledges that his status and achievements are not of his own making. This humility is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). It emphasizes the biblical principle that God chooses and uses the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). David's question also highlights the special relationship between God and Israel, His chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>that we should be able to give as generously as this?</b><br>David marvels at the ability of the Israelites to contribute so abundantly to the building of the temple. This reflects the cultural and religious importance of the temple as a central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>). The generosity of the people is seen as a response to God's faithfulness and provision. This mirrors the New Testament teaching on giving, where believers are encouraged to give cheerfully and generously (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>For everything comes from You,</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty and ownership over all creation. Theologically, it aligns with the doctrine of God as Creator and Sustainer (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine kingship, where the deity is seen as the ultimate source of all blessings. It underscores the biblical truth that humans are stewards of God's resources (<a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><b>and from Your own hand we have given to You.</b><br>David recognizes that their offerings are merely returning to God what He has already provided. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where believers are caretakers of God's gifts (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). It also connects to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where offerings were a way to honor God and acknowledge His provision (Leviticus 1-7). This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate gift from God, given for the salvation of humanity (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is speaking in this verse.
