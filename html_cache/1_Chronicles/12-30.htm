This tribe held significant influence in the northern kingdom and was often representative of the entire northern tribes. The tribe's territory was centrally located in the land of Canaan, which gave it strategic importance. Ephraim's prominence is seen in various biblical narratives, such as in the leadership of Joshua, who was from this tribe.<p><b>20,800 mighty men of valor:</b><br>The mention of 20,800 men highlights the substantial military contribution from the tribe of Ephraim. "Mighty men of valor" indicates not only their physical strength and bravery but also their readiness to support David, reflecting their loyalty and commitment. This phrase underscores the importance of military might in the ancient Near Eastern context, where tribal strength was often measured by the number of warriors.<p><b>Famous among their own clans:</b><br>Being "famous among their own clans" suggests that these men were not only recognized for their military prowess but also held in high esteem within their community. This fame could be due to their leadership, past victories, or notable deeds. In the tribal society of ancient Israel, such recognition would have been crucial for maintaining social order and cohesion.
