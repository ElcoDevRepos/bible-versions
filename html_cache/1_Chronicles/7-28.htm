It was a central place of worship and a site where Jacob had his vision of the ladder reaching to heaven (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>). The mention of "villages" indicates the surrounding smaller communities that were part of the larger Bethel area. Bethel was strategically located on the border between the tribes of Benjamin and Ephraim, making it an important religious and political center.<p><b>Naaran to the east</b><br>Naaran, also known as Naarah, is less frequently mentioned in the Bible, but its inclusion here highlights its geographical importance. Located to the east, it suggests the eastern boundary of the territory. This area was part of the land allocated to the tribe of Ephraim, indicating the extent of their influence and control.<p><b>Gezer and its villages to the west</b><br>Gezer was a significant Canaanite city-state before being conquered by the Israelites. It was strategically located on the coastal plain, serving as a key military and trade route. The mention of "villages" suggests the inclusion of smaller settlements under Gezer's influence. Gezer was later given to Solomon as a dowry when he married Pharaoh's daughter (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>), indicating its continued importance.<p><b>and Shechem and its villages</b><br>Shechem holds a prominent place in biblical history as a city of refuge and a center of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). It was located in the hill country of Ephraim and served as a significant religious and political center. The mention of "villages" indicates the surrounding communities that were part of Shechem's domain. Shechem's central location made it a key site for tribal gatherings and decisions.<p><b>as far as Ayyah and its villages</b><br>Ayyah, also known as Ai, was a city near Bethel. It is famously known for its initial defeat of the Israelites due to Achan's sin and its subsequent destruction (Joshua 7-8). The mention of "villages" suggests the inclusion of smaller settlements in the area. Ai's location near Bethel highlights the strategic importance of this region in the central highlands of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant city in the history of Israel, often associated with the patriarch Jacob, who had a vision of angels ascending and descending a ladder there.

These &#8220;villages&#8221; point to a network of smaller communities that depended on Bethel&#8217;s central location for worship, security, and commerce.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Naaran to the east</b><p>- &#8220;Naaran&#8221; (called &#8220;Naarath&#8221; in <a href="/joshua/16-7.htm">Joshua 16:7</a>) lay to the east of Bethel, closer to the Jordan Valley. Its placement highlights the breadth of Ephraim&#8217;s land from the hill country down toward the lowlands.<p>- <a href="/joshua/16-7.htm">Joshua 16:7</a> mentions that the border of Joseph&#8217;s sons passed &#8220;to Naarath, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan,&#8221; showing that Ephraim enjoyed access to fertile plains and trade routes.<p>- By including Naaran, the text silently affirms that God fulfilled His promise to give Israel territory &#8220;from the wilderness&#8230;to the Euphrates&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>), here realized on a smaller tribal scale.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gezer and its villages to the west</b><p>- Turning from east to west, the chronicler names &#8220;Gezer and its villages.&#8221; Gezer lay near the coastal plain, guarding the approaches to the Mediterranean trade routes.<p>- <a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3, 10</a> records that Ephraim received Gezer yet struggled to drive out the Canaanites completely&#8212;evidence of the ongoing need for faithfulness in occupying God-given land.<p>- <a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a> notes that Pharaoh later captured Gezer and gave it to Solomon, indicating Gezer&#8217;s strategic value and explaining why its retention in Ephraim&#8217;s list mattered: it proved the tribe&#8217;s rightful, historic claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shechem and its villages as far as Ayyah and its villages</b><p>- Finally, the verse stretches northward to &#8220;Shechem and its villages as far as Ayyah and its villages.&#8221; Shechem sat in the heart of Ephraim between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. It is where Abram first built an altar (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) and where Joshua renewed the covenant (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25</a>).<p>- By pairing Shechem with &#8220;Ayyah&#8221; (likely Ai, near Bethel; <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>; 8:17), the chronicler draws a line from the tribe&#8217;s central city to its outermost northeastern point.<p>- Together these sites testify to God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness: Shechem holds the memory of Israel&#8217;s commitments, while Ai/Ayyah recalls both defeat and victory, reminding readers that obedience secures the land (<a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/7-28.htm">1 Chronicles 7:28</a> maps the God-given inheritance of Ephraim from west (Gezer) to east (Naaran) and from south-central (Bethel) to north (Shechem-Ayyah). Each location echoes earlier moments in biblical history, proving that the chronicler isn&#8217;t offering random geography but displaying the concrete fulfillment of promises first made to the patriarchs and then to the tribes. The verse reassures readers that the LORD&#8217;s word stands, the land is real, and the covenant people truly lived in&#8212;and were expected to steward&#8212;these specific territories.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE BOUNDS OF EPHRAIM AND WEST MANASSEH</span><p>(<a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-28.htm" title="And their possessions and habitations were, Bethel and the towns thereof, and eastward Naaran, and westward Gezer, with the towns thereof; Shechem also and the towns thereof, to Gaza and the towns thereof:">1Chronicles 7:28-29</a>).<p>Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-54.htm" title="Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites: for theirs was the lot.">1Chronicles 6:54</a>, sqq., where a list of the cities of the Levites is similarly added to their tribal registers.<p>(28) <span class= "bld">And their possessions.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">and their</span> <span class= "ital">domain and their seats were Bethel and her daughters;</span> "their domain," that is, the domain of both divisions of the tribe of Joseph.<p><span class= "bld">Bethel</span>--originally assigned to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-22.htm" title="And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,">Joshua 18:22</a>), belonged later to the northern kingdom.
