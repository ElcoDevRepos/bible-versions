The mention of his sons highlights the continuation of the tribe of Judah. Er, Onan, and Shelah are part of the genealogical record that establishes the heritage of the tribe. This genealogy is crucial for understanding the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding his descendants.<p><b>These three were born to him by Bath-shua the Canaanite.</b><br>Bath-shua, also known as Shuah, was a Canaanite woman, indicating Judah's marriage outside of the Israelite community. This union reflects the complex interactions between the Israelites and the surrounding Canaanite culture. Marriages with Canaanites were often discouraged due to the potential for leading Israelites away from worshiping Yahweh. This context sets the stage for the challenges Judah's family would face.<p><b>Er, Judah&#8217;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD.</b><br>Er's wickedness is noted without specific details, but it emphasizes the moral expectations God had for His people. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores the divine perspective on human actions, highlighting God's omniscience and moral authority. This serves as a reminder of the importance of righteousness and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>So the LORD put him to death.</b><br>The death of Er by divine intervention illustrates the seriousness of sin and God's direct involvement in the lives of His people. It serves as a warning about the consequences of wickedness and disobedience. This act of judgment is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God enforces His standards of holiness, reinforcing the theme of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a significant figure in the lineage of Jesus Christ.
