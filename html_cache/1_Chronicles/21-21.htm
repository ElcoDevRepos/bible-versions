This event occurs after David's census of Israel, which displeased God and led to a plague. The location is significant as it is the future site of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Jebusites were the original inhabitants of Jerusalem before David conquered the city, indicating a peaceful coexistence at this point. This encounter highlights David's role as a leader who seeks to rectify his wrongs by building an altar to the Lord.<p><b>and when Ornan looked out and saw David</b><br>Ornan, engaged in his daily work, notices the approach of the king. This indicates Ornan's position as a landowner and a person of some standing, as he possesses a threshing floor. The threshing floor is a place where grain is separated from chaff, symbolizing judgment and purification, which is fitting given the context of David's repentance. Ornan's recognition of David suggests the king's prominence and respect among the people, even those of different ethnic backgrounds.<p><b>he left the threshing floor</b><br>Ornan's immediate response to leave his work signifies respect and urgency. The threshing floor, often located on elevated ground for wind exposure, is a place of economic activity and importance. Ornan's willingness to leave it unattended reflects his recognition of the significance of David's visit and possibly an understanding of the divine purpose behind it.<p><b>and bowed facedown before David</b><br>Bowing facedown is a gesture of deep respect and submission, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures when in the presence of royalty or someone of high status. This act demonstrates Ornan's acknowledgment of David's authority and possibly his awareness of the spiritual implications of the king's visit. The act of bowing also prefigures the reverence due to Christ, the ultimate King, and foreshadows the worship that will occur at the Temple, which will be built on this very site.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God, but also for his human failings.
