This system ensured that the responsibilities of the priests were carried out efficiently and reverently. The order was established to maintain a continuous and orderly worship of God, highlighting the importance of discipline and routine in spiritual practices.<p><b>when they entered the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites. It was a sacred space where God's presence dwelt among His people. The priests' entry into the temple was a significant act, symbolizing their role as mediators between God and the people. This phrase underscores the holiness and reverence required when approaching God.<p><b>according to the regulations prescribed for them</b><br>The regulations were detailed instructions given to ensure that the worship and sacrifices were conducted in a manner pleasing to God. These rules were not arbitrary but were divinely ordained to reflect God's holiness and the need for purity in worship. The adherence to these regulations demonstrates the importance of obedience and reverence in the service of God.<p><b>by their forefather Aaron</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first high priest and the ancestor of the Levitical priesthood. His role established the priestly lineage and set the precedent for the duties and responsibilities of the priests. Aaron's leadership and the regulations given to him were foundational for the priestly service, emphasizing the continuity and faithfulness of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine authority behind the priestly regulations. The commands were not human inventions but were given by God Himself, underscoring His sovereignty and the importance of following His will.

Each course received a fixed turn, ensuring worship in the temple continued without interruption (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/31-2.htm">2 Chronicles 31:2</a>; <a href="/luke/1-8.htm">Luke 1:8-9</a>).<p>&#8211; The word &#8220;appointed&#8221; underscores that the schedule was not casual or optional; it carried the weight of divine appointment, just as the Levites&#8217; duties had earlier been &#8220;assigned by lot&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical takeaway: God values order in worship. From the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16-33</a>) to the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>), He prescribes structure so His people can serve Him harmoniously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when they entered the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8211; The &#8220;house of the LORD&#8221; points ahead from David&#8217;s planning to Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-10.htm">1 Chronicles 28:10</a>). Entering it was a privilege reserved for consecrated priests (<a href="/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-11.htm">2 Chronicles 5:11</a>).<p>&#8211; This phrase roots the verse in everyday ministry: sacrifices at the altar (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;7</a>), incense on the golden altar (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>), and blessings over Israel (<a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>).<p>&#8211; Even in exile, returning priests looked back to these rhythms (<a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2-4</a>). The verse reminds us that worship is not merely internal devotion but also physical participation in God&#8217;s designated place (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron</b><p>&#8211; Aaron, the first high priest (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>), received detailed instructions for priestly conduct (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8-10</a>). Those &#8220;regulations&#8221; shaped everything from garments to sacrifices.<p>&#8211; Passing those statutes from generation to generation highlighted covenant continuity (<a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>). The priests in David&#8217;s day served under the same pattern given centuries earlier, affirming that truth does not change with culture (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p>&#8211; Application: ministry is safest when it clings to God-given patterns rather than inventing new ones that eclipse Scripture (<a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him</b><p>&#8211; The ultimate authority was neither Aaron nor David but &#8220;the LORD, the God of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-4.htm">Malachi 2:4-5</a>). By echoing the original command, the Chronicler stresses that obedience brings blessing, disobedience judgment (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p>&#8211; Every part of temple service flowed from God&#8217;s word. In the same way, the church&#8217;s ministry must rest on Christ&#8217;s command (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>) rather than human preference.<p>&#8211; Because the command comes from the covenant-keeping God, Israel could trust the effectiveness of the priesthood, anticipating the perfect Priest to come (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/24-19.htm">1 Chronicles 24:19</a> seals the roster of priestly divisions with four truths:<p>&#8211; God Himself established an orderly schedule for worship.<p>&#8211; Service occurs in a holy, designated place.<p>&#8211; The pattern stretches back to Aaron and remains unchanged.<p>&#8211; Ultimate authority rests in the unchanging command of the LORD.<p>The verse therefore affirms that authentic ministry is orderly, continuous, rooted in prior revelation, and grounded in God&#8217;s sovereign command&#8212;principles still vital for the worshiping community today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">These were the orderings of them in their service.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">These were their classes for their service.</span><p><span class= "bld">According to their manner, under Aaron.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">according to their rule</span> (or order; Vulg., <span class= "ital">ritum</span>)<span class= "ital">, ordained through Aaron,</span> &c.

All the sacerdotal functions were fixed, and each of the twenty-four classes undertook the weekly discharge of them in rotation with the rest, beginning on the Sabbath (<a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm" title="And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.">2Kings 11:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-8.htm" title="So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.">2Chronicles 23:8</a>). Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. vii.</span> 14, 7) declares that the arrangements of David lasted down to his own day. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The order has been thus given of the twenty-four classes or courses of the priests. Each course served a week from the seventh day to the seventh (<a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>). An interesting allusion to this order of courses is tacitly made in <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>, where the twenty-fifth idolater may be supposed to be the high priest. Some have, on very insufficient grounds, supposed that this "ordering" of courses was not really the institution of David, but attributed to him after the Exile for the sake of the authority of his name. In <a href="/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>, moreover, the names do not appear as even twenty-four, but twenty-two - deficient by two! - a thing most easily to be accounted for. In addition to the direct scriptural witness on this subject, Josephus's ('Ant.,' 7:14) testimony confirms the account of our present chapter, while Movers (in 'Chronik.,' 279) and Dehler (in Herzog's 'R.E.,' 12:185) effectively combat the positions of De Wette and Gramberg, and of Herzberg, in his 'History of the People of Israel.' <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/24-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their appointed order</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;qud&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
