In the biblical context, God often communicated His plans through prophets or direct revelation, as seen with figures like Moses and Samuel. The term "servant" underscores David's humility and submission to God's will, a common theme in the Old Testament where leaders are often depicted as servants of God (e.g., Moses in <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>).<p><b>that You will build a house for him.</b><br>The "house" refers to a dynastic promise rather than a physical structure. This is a pivotal moment in biblical history, as it establishes the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his lineage will endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This covenant is foundational for understanding the messianic prophecies, as it sets the stage for the expectation of a Messiah from David's line, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>.<p><b>Therefore Your servant has found the courage to pray before You.</b><br>David's response to God's promise is one of boldness in prayer, reflecting a deep trust in God's faithfulness. This courage is rooted in the assurance of God's promises, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, where believers are encouraged to approach God's throne with confidence. David's prayerful response serves as a model for believers, illustrating how divine promises can inspire bold and faithful prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who desires to build a temple for God but is instead promised an everlasting dynasty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who makes a covenant with David, promising to establish his house and kingdom forever.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The messenger through whom God communicates His covenant to David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_davidic_covenant.htm">The Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise that David's lineage will endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigns and where the future temple will be built.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_promises.htm">God's Sovereignty in Promises</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.

Because God spoke, David can now speak (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>- Courage here is not self-confidence but God-confidence, echoing <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>: &#8220;you received the Spirit of adoption&#8230;by whom we cry, &#8216;Abba, Father!&#8217;&#8221;<p>- Faith draws strength directly from God&#8217;s irrevocable word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to pray before You</b><p>- Prayer is the appointed means to align David&#8217;s heart with God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2-3</a>).<p>- By praying &#8220;before&#8221; God, David acknowledges both access and accountability, much like Solomon will do at the temple dedication (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-4.htm">2 Chronicles 6:4-6</a>).<p>- Every promise pushes the believer toward communion, for &#8220;all the promises of God are &#8216;Yes&#8217; in Christ&#8221; and thus summon an &#8220;Amen&#8221; through us to God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God&#8217;s self-disclosure to David produces worship, humility, faith, courage, and prayer. The promise that the Lord Himself will build David a house anchors David&#8217;s confidence and shapes his response. In the same way, every revealed promise of Scripture invites believers to trust, speak boldly, and pray expectantly, knowing the faithful God who initiates will also fulfill.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">O</span> <span class= "bld">my God.</span>--Samuel: "Jehovah Sabaoth, God of Israel."<p><span class= "bld">Hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">hast uncovered the ear of Thy servant, to build him a house.</span> Samuel has the more usual construction: "saying, A house I will build thee."
