This task required integrity and trustworthiness, reflecting the Levites' dedication to God's service.<p><b>and the treasuries of the dedicated things.</b><br>The dedicated things were items set apart for sacred use, often as a result of vows or offerings made by the Israelites. These could include precious metals, stones, and other valuable materials. The management of these items by the Levites indicates the importance of consecration and the proper handling of what is devoted to God. This concept of dedication is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live lives set apart for God's purposes, reflecting the holiness and dedication seen in the temple service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties, particularly in the service of the tabernacle and later the temple.
