This location is significant in biblical history, being associated with figures like Samuel. The role of overseeing vineyards indicates a position of responsibility and trust, as vineyards were valuable assets in ancient Israel, providing wine, a staple in the diet and religious practices. The mention of Shimei highlights the organized structure of King David's administration, where specific individuals were appointed to manage different aspects of the kingdom's resources.<p><b>Zabdi the Shiphmite was in charge of the produce of the vineyards for the wine vats.</b><br>Zabdi, described as a Shiphmite, suggests he is from a place called Shiphmoth, though its exact location is uncertain. His responsibility for the produce of the vineyards, specifically for the wine vats, underscores the importance of wine production in Israelite society. Wine was not only a common beverage but also used in religious offerings and celebrations. This role required expertise in viticulture and wine-making, reflecting the advanced agricultural practices of the time. The division of labor between Shimei and Zabdi illustrates the detailed and efficient management system under King David, ensuring the kingdom's prosperity and stability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei_the_ramathite.htm">Shimei the Ramathite</a></b><br>Shimei is identified as the overseer of the vineyards.

By maintaining them well, Shimei helped Israel enjoy the fruit God promised (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Beyond agriculture, vineyards point forward to spiritual truths. Jesus said, &#8220;I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>).
