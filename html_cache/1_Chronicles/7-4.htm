This highlights the significance of their contribution to the military strength of Israel.<p><b>according to their genealogy</b><br>Genealogies were crucial in ancient Israel for establishing identity, inheritance rights, and tribal affiliation. They served as a record of God's faithfulness in preserving His people. The genealogical records in Chronicles emphasize the continuity of God's covenant with Israel, tracing the lineage from the patriarchs to the post-exilic community.<p><b>they had 36,000 troops for battle</b><br>The mention of 36,000 troops underscores the military capability and readiness of the tribe of Issachar. This reflects the broader theme in Chronicles of highlighting the strength and organization of the tribes of Israel. The number signifies a substantial force, indicating the tribe's significant role in the defense and warfare of the nation.<p><b>for they had many wives and children</b><br>Polygamy was a common practice in ancient Israel, often associated with wealth and status. Having many wives and children was seen as a blessing and a means to ensure the growth and continuation of one's lineage. This practice contributed to the large number of troops, as more descendants meant more potential soldiers. The cultural context of polygamy is evident in the lives of several biblical figures, such as King David and Solomon, though it often led to familial and spiritual complications.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_issachar.htm">Tribe of Issachar</a></b><br>This verse is part of the genealogical record of the tribe of Issachar, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

This seems to say that as the Tolaites were in David's time twenty-two thousand six hundred, so the Uzzites taken from among them (or the "sons of Izrahiah," as the case may be) numbered thirty-six thousand additional. But were not the Uzzites included in the Tolaites? and did not the figure thirty-six thousand embrace the accumulated numbers, whilst the balance of fifty-one thousand necessary to make up the eighty-seven thousand of ver. 5, was drawn from all the other branches of the Issachar tribe? This is not the view, however, generally taken, and if the numbers of vers. 2 and 4 are distinct, the balance needful for ver. 5 will, of course, be twenty-eight thousand four hundred. It cannot be denied that this view is favoured by the special description applied to these Uzzites, or Izrahiahites, as bands of soldiers for war; their disposition and their training constituting possibly the reason of their being singled out for further description from among the sons of Tola. The statement of the total number of the tribe of Issachar in David's time is wonderfully corroborated by the two censuses of Moses - <a href="/numbers/1-28.htm">Numbers 1:28, 29</a>, fifty-four thousand four hundred; and <a href="/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23-25</a>, sixty-four thousand three hundred. The total of Issachar, <span class="cmt_word">four score and seven thousand</span>, is a good proportion of the aggregate total of all the tribes, given (<a href="/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8, 9</a>) as eight hundred thousand. Grove, however, adds all the above numbers, and makes thereby Issachar's total (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:901 <span class="accented">b</span>) one hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred, which seems disfavoured by the numbers at the second census of Moses. At the time of this census Issachar came third of all the tribes, only Judah and Dan taking precedence. The <span class="cmt_word">bands of soldiers for war</span>. This expression culminates in the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "bands," which is applied (<a href="/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>) to Gad, and almost invariably to the irregular but special bodies of fighting men of the nations round (Authorized Version, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23</a> is incorrect, the Hebrew word being different).
