This title underscores his intimate relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that God spoke to Moses face to face. Moses' life and ministry are foundational to the history of Israel, as he led the people out of Egypt and received the Law on Mount Sinai. His designation as "the man of God" also points to his role as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>his sons were named among the tribe of Levi</b><br>Moses' sons, Gershom and Eliezer, were counted among the tribe of Levi, which was set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle. This inclusion emphasizes the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood and the importance of family lineage in the Old Testament. The Levites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and later the temple, playing a crucial role in the spiritual life of Israel. This connection to the tribe of Levi also highlights the continuity of God's covenant promises, as the Levites were chosen to serve God in a special capacity, foreshadowing the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Known as the "man of God," Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and receive the Law on Mount Sinai.

This challenges us to consider how we are living out our faith and what legacy we are leaving behind.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_family_in_ministry.htm">The Role of Family in Ministry</a></b><br>Although Moses' sons are not as prominent as their father, their inclusion among the Levites shows the importance of family in ministry. It encourages us to involve our families in our spiritual journeys and service to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_heritage.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Heritage</a></b><br>The Levites were set apart for God's service, and Moses' sons being counted among them underscores the value of a spiritual heritage. We are reminded to cherish and pass on our faith to the next generation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>The inclusion of Moses' sons among the Levites illustrates God's sovereign choice in appointing individuals for His purposes.

Right in the middle of that list, verse 14 pauses: &#8220;As for Moses&#8230;&#8221; It is as if the writer leans in to highlight a familiar friend of the nation before moving on. Moses, though deceased for centuries, still stands as the benchmark of covenant leadership (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10-12</a>). David&#8217;s generation&#8212;and ours&#8212;needs the reminder that God works through specific people in specific tribes to accomplish His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the man of God</b><p>The title &#8220;man of God&#8221; is used for Moses more than for anyone else (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). It stresses:<p>&#8226; Divine calling&#8212;God initiates (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine authority&#8212;what Moses said carried God&#8217;s weight (<a href="/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine character&#8212;he walked in humility and faithfulness (<a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3, 7</a>).<p>When 1 Chron 23 labels Moses this way, it confirms that every detail that follows&#8212;his sons, their tribe, their service&#8212;is grounded in God&#8217;s own choosing, not mere family favoritism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his sons were named</b><p>Verse 15 gives their names&#8212;&#8220;The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.&#8221; Those names recall God&#8217;s past help (<a href="/exodus/18-3.htm">Exodus 18:3-4</a>). Here the chronicler notes simply that they were &#8220;named&#8221;; in other words, officially registered.<p>&#8226; Registration mattered because temple duties were assigned by family (<a href="/numbers/4-34.htm">Numbers 4:34-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Inclusion showed that Moses&#8217; household was not exempt from obedience; even the law-giver&#8217;s children had to line up for census like everyone else (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness extended to the next generation, just as He promised in <a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among the tribe of Levi</b><p>Moses was born a Levite (<a href="/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1-2</a>). Yet his line did not receive the priestly office; that privilege went to Aaron&#8217;s line (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). By recording that Moses&#8217; sons were &#8220;among the tribe of Levi,&#8221; Scripture clarifies:<p>&#8226; Their calling&#8212;Gershom and Eliezer served as Levites, assisting priests but not offering sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Their equality&#8212;they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with other Levitical clans such as the Kohathites and Merarites (1 Chron 23:6-12).<p>&#8226; Their testimony&#8212;Moses&#8217; family modeled submission to God&#8217;s structure. No family, however esteemed, may grasp roles God has assigned elsewhere (<a href="/numbers/16-8.htm">Numbers 16:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14</a> reminds us that even the most celebrated leader, Moses, belonged to a larger covenant family and lived under God&#8217;s order. His honored title, the registration of his sons, and their placement within Levi all underscore a single truth: God&#8217;s work is carried forward by faithful people who accept His design without seeking special privilege.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Now concerning Moses the man of God.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Now Moses, the man of God.</span><p><span class= "bld">His sons were named</span> (or should be named) <span class= "bld">of the tribe of Levi.</span>--See <a href="/genesis/48-6.htm" title="And your issue, which you beget after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.">Genesis 48:6</a> for the phrase "to be called after" (<span class= "ital">niqra' 'al</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Aaron's sons were priests; but the sons of Moses, his brother, were reckoned as simple Levites, and therefore their houses are here enumerated (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/23-15.htm" title="The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.">1Chronicles 23:15-17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The man of</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--See <a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm" title="And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; Psalms 90; <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>.
