The Edomite kings are listed in <a href="/1_chronicles/1.htm">1 Chronicles 1</a> and <a href="/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36</a>, showing the historical lineage and political structure of Edom. Hadad's death marks a transition in leadership, which was common in ancient monarchies. The name Hadad is also associated with a storm god in ancient Near Eastern cultures, indicating the possible influence of surrounding cultures on Edom.<p><b>Samlah from Masrekah</b><br>Samlah is noted as the successor to Hadad, indicating a continuation of the Edomite monarchy. Masrekah, his place of origin, is not well-documented archaeologically, but its mention suggests it was a significant location within Edom. The transition of power to Samlah highlights the political stability and continuity in Edom, despite the lack of hereditary succession, as these kings were not necessarily from the same family line. This reflects the broader ancient Near Eastern practice of kingship, where leadership could be based on merit or conquest rather than direct descent.<p><b>reigned in his place</b><br>The phrase indicates the orderly succession of kingship, a common theme in the historical books of the Bible. This orderly transition contrasts with the often tumultuous changes in leadership seen in Israel and Judah, emphasizing the relative stability of Edom during this period. The concept of reigning "in his place" also underscores the idea of divine sovereignty and providence in the establishment of rulers, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. This can be connected to <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which speaks of God's ordination of governing authorities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadad.htm">Hadad</a></b><br>A king mentioned in the genealogies of Edom.

The chronicler sets the stage for that comparison: transient Edomite rule versus the coming eternal King (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also underscores personal responsibility; when one leader passes, another answers for the nation (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).
