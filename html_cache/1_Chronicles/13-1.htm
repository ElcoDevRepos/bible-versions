This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wise counsel, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety." David's approach contrasts with that of Saul, who often acted independently. This moment marks a significant shift in Israel's leadership, emphasizing unity and collective decision-making. It also foreshadows the establishment of a more organized and centralized government under David's reign.<p><b>the commanders of thousands and of hundreds</b><br>This phrase indicates the military structure of ancient Israel, which was organized into units of thousands and hundreds. This system is reminiscent of the organization established by Moses in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where leaders were appointed over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. The mention of these commanders highlights the importance of military leadership in David's administration and the need for strategic planning and unity among the tribes of Israel. It also underscores the significance of David's actions in rallying the nation, as he prepares to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, symbolizing God's presence and blessing upon his reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and leadership.

The word &#8220;Then&#8221; signals that what follows grows directly out of that coronation.<p>- Scripture frequently highlights pivotal &#8220;then&#8221; moments that move God&#8217;s redemptive plan forward&#8212;such as Noah after the flood (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20&#8211;22</a>) or Joshua crossing the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1&#8211;9</a>). Here, David&#8217;s next move will shape Israel&#8217;s worship life by bringing the ark to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>conferred</b><p>- &#8220;Conferred&#8221; shows David choosing dialogue over decree. Though anointed by God (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) and already victorious in battle (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17&#8211;25</a>), he still seeks counsel.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a> affirms, &#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.&#8221;<p>- David&#8217;s example demonstrates servant leadership: listening, weighing opinions, and thereby validating his people. It foreshadows the New Testament pattern of shared wisdom in <a href="/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4&#8211;6</a> when the apostles and elders gathered to consider doctrine together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all his leaders</b><p>- David does not limit consultation to a select circle. &#8220;All his leaders&#8221; indicates broad inclusion&#8212;tribal heads, elders, and key officials (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16&#8211;22</a>).<p>- <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16&#8211;17</a> shows Moses similarly gathering seventy elders so that &#8220;they will share the burden of the people with you.&#8221; David imitates that model, reinforcing that leadership in Israel is communal and accountable.<p>- The New Covenant echoes this ethic: pastors and elders shepherd &#8220;among&#8221; the flock, not over it in domination (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the commanders of thousands and of hundreds</b><p>- This military language recalls the organizational structure given through Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21, 25</a>). Commanders of thousands oversaw larger units; commanders of hundreds handled smaller divisions.<p>- By involving these officers, David ensures the logistical muscle to transport the ark safely&#8212;experienced men who understand order and discipline (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25&#8211;28</a>).<p>- Their inclusion unites civic, military, and spiritual spheres under one purpose, illustrating that worship is never detached from daily life or national identity (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a> shows David&#8212;freshly crowned&#8212;immediately seeking broad, godly counsel.
