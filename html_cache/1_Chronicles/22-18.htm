In the Old Testament, God's presence was often associated with the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle, signifying His dwelling among the Israelites. This assurance of God's presence is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus promises His disciples, "I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The rhetorical question implies confidence in God's ongoing support and guidance.<p><b>and has He not granted you rest on every side?</b><br>The concept of "rest" in the Old Testament often refers to peace and security from enemies, a fulfillment of God's promises to Israel. This rest was a significant aspect of the covenant blessings, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>, where God promises rest in the Promised Land. Historically, this period of rest came after David's military victories, which subdued surrounding nations. Theologically, this rest prefigures the ultimate rest found in Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers enter God's rest through faith.<p><b>For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand</b><br>This phrase reflects the divine assistance in military conquests, a common theme in the narratives of Joshua and David. The victories over the inhabitants of Canaan were seen as acts of divine judgment and fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Theologically, these victories symbolize God's sovereignty and faithfulness. They also foreshadow Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as He conquers spiritual enemies on behalf of His people.<p><b>and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people</b><br>The subduing of the land signifies the establishment of Israel's dominion, aligning with God's command in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> to subdue the earth. This phrase highlights the partnership between divine initiative and human responsibility. The land's subjugation is not merely a political achievement but a spiritual act of obedience to God's will. It underscores the idea that true victory and peace come when God's people align with His purposes. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live in submission to Christ, the ultimate King, and to advance His kingdom on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is speaking in this verse.

What David says here is equivalent to the declaration of the perfect fulfilment of the promises of nine hundred years ago. By faith of those very promises how many generations had lived! What journeyings, suspense, punishment, and struggle, the intervening centuries had witnessed! And now at last it is given to the lip of the aged David to pronounce the termination of a nation's prolonged conflict, its entrance into peace, and the fulfilment of the most impassioned wishes, ima-ginings, end prayers of the patriarchs, of Moses, and of a long line of the faithful. It was well for David that he could not foresee and did not know how near the culminating of a nation's glory and prosperity might be to its woeful fall and prolonged decay. The analogy that obtains in this respect between the history of an individual and of a nation is as remarkable as it should be instructive and turned to the uses of warning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/22-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;[Is] not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
