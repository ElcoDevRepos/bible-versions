The term "honorable" suggests a reputation for integrity and righteousness, qualities highly valued in biblical narratives. This distinction implies that Jabez's character set him apart from his siblings, possibly indicating a life of faithfulness and devotion to God. The emphasis on honor may also reflect the cultural importance of reputation and legacy in ancient Israelite society. The mention of brothers suggests a familial context, where sibling relationships often highlight themes of rivalry or distinction, as seen in stories like Joseph and his brothers in Genesis.<p><b>His mother had named him Jabez, saying,</b><br>The act of naming in biblical times carried significant weight, often reflecting circumstances of birth or prophetic insights into a person's future. The name "Jabez" is derived from a Hebrew root meaning "pain" or "sorrow," indicating that his mother experienced significant distress during childbirth. This practice of naming based on birth circumstances is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as with Benjamin, whose mother Rachel named him Ben-Oni, meaning "son of my sorrow," before his father Jacob renamed him. The mother's role in naming highlights the maternal influence and the emotional and physical challenges of childbirth in ancient times.<p><b>&#8220;Because I bore him in pain.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase underscores the physical and emotional toll of childbirth, a common theme in biblical narratives. Pain in childbirth is first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a> as part of the consequences of the Fall, linking Jabez's story to the broader narrative of human suffering and redemption. The acknowledgment of pain also reflects the reality of life in a fallen world, where joy and sorrow often coexist. This context may suggest that Jabez's life, marked by a name associated with pain, would be one of overcoming adversity, a theme resonant with the biblical message of hope and divine intervention. The mention of pain could also foreshadow the transformative power of prayer and faith, as Jabez later calls on God for blessing and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabez.htm">Jabez</a></b><br>A man noted for his honor and integrity, more so than his brothers.

Compare <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>, &#8220;Those who honor Me I will honor,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>, where humility and the fear of the LORD bring &#8220;wealth and honor and life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The chronicler pauses the genealogies to spotlight Jabez, signaling God&#8217;s esteem for a man whose heart was set apart.<p>&#8226; Verse 10 shows Jabez praying boldly&#8212;and God granting his request&#8212;demonstrating that the LORD rewards faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>) and delights in those who seek Him (<a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the text calls believers to cultivate character over pedigree or circumstances, knowing &#8220;a good name is to be chosen over great riches&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother had named him Jabez.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;His mother had named him Jabez&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Names in the Bible often capture destiny or testimony. Consider <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a> (Abram to Abraham) or <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a> (Jesus &#8220;will save His people from their sins&#8221;).<p>&#8226; A mother&#8217;s voice shapes a child&#8217;s identity, yet God&#8217;s calling can override any earthly label (<a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The prominence Jabez attains in Scripture shows that God&#8217;s purpose is not boxed in by human naming, reminding us of <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, where God chooses the unlikely to display His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because I bore him in pain.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Because I bore him in pain.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, where pain in childbirth entered the human story through sin. Jabez&#8217;s very name (&#8220;He makes sorrow&#8221;) embodies the brokenness of a fallen world.<p>&#8226; Other mothers marked sorrow in naming&#8212;Rachel called her dying son Ben-oni (&#8220;son of my sorrow&#8221;) before Jacob renamed him Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a>); Phinehas&#8217;s wife cried &#8220;Ichabod&#8221; at Israel&#8217;s defeat (<a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God turns pain into purpose. Jabez does not remain defined by grief; his honor and answered prayer (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-10.htm">1 Chronicles 4:10</a>) testify that &#8220;weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, this assures us that personal history, even birthed in hardship, can become a platform for God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jabez entered the world under the shadow of pain, yet Scripture highlights him as &#8220;more honorable&#8221; than his brothers. His mother&#8217;s sorrow-laden naming could not confine the man whose faith won divine favor. The verse teaches that God sees and rewards heart-level honor, redeems the sting of a fallen world, and writes a greater story than our beginnings foresee.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">More honourable</span> <span class= "bld">than his</span> <span class= "bld">brethren.</span>--Comp. what is said of Hamor son of Shechem in <a href="/genesis/34-19.htm" title="And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.">Genesis 34:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">His brethren.</span>--Perhaps the sons of Coz.

The episode of these two verses, offering itself amid what should seem, superficially, a dry mass of dead names, is welcome and grateful as the oasis of the desert, and it warns us that life lies hidden at our every footfall on this ground, spread over though it is with monument and inscription, and hollow, as we thought, with the deadest of the dead. But the glimpse of old real life given us in this brief fragment of a biography is refreshing and is very suggestive. It seems an insufficient and unnatural method of accounting for the suddenness of the appearance of this episode to suppose ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in lee.</span>) that the name of Jahez was well known, from any cause, to those for whom Chronicles may be supposed to have been primarily intended. We prefer by far <span class="accented">one</span> account of it, viz. that the work in our hands is not in its original complete state; or, variously put, that it <span class="accented">is</span> in its uncompleted original state. No root corresponding to the characters of this name in present order is known; it is possible that some euphonic reason makes the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> out of the real word (future Kal) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he causes pains. We cannot suppose there would be any "play" appreciable on a transposition of alphabetical characters for <span class="accented">mere</span> play's sake. The resemblance that almost each part of this brief and abruptly introduced narration bears to incidents recorded in Genesis (<a href="/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>) and Exodus speaks for itself, and strongly countenances the supposition that it is a genuine deposit of the genuinely olden history of Judah. The mother's reason for the naming of the child; the language and matter and form (<a href="/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18-20</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>) of the prayer of the child, when presumably he was no longer a child; and the discriminating use of the words <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (ver. 10) <span class="accented">of Israel</span>, as comps, red with the name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a>; 5:41), generally found here, - all help to produce this impression, although some of these particulars would carry little conviction by themselves; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> a mother's reasons for assigning the name of her child long outlived the earlier times alone. Upon the whole, and regarding the passage in its present place, we may say that it must be very much <span class="accented">misplaced</span>, or else must be understood to connect Jabez with some branch of the family of Coz. There is the more room to assume this in the vagueness of the last preceding clause, "The families of Aharhel the son of Harum." The origin of the theories of some of the older Jewish writers, to the effect that Jabez was a doctor in the law, with a school of scribes around him, is probably to be found in the desire to find a connection between his proper name, Jabez, and the <span class="accented">place</span> so named (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>), and where, as we are told, "families of scribes dwelt," belonging to the Kenites. That these were connected with Bethlehem, through Salma, and that Jabez of our present passage was also of a family connected with Bethlehem, is worthy of notice, but is not enough by a long way to countenance the thought, in spite of Targum and Talmud (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' <span class="accented">sub vet.</span>). The Targum, as well here as in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>, identifies Jabez with Othniel "son of Keuaz" (<a href="/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>; <a href="/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>; <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>), or more probably "the Kenizzite" merely; but there is nothing to sustain such an identification. The description, he was more honourable than his brethren, finds a close parallel, so far as the word <span class="accented">honourable</span> goes, in <a href="/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; although the honourableness of Shechem, the person there in question, does not come out to anything like the same advantage with that of Jabez, nor at all in the same direction. The word, however, is precisely the same, is often used elsewhere, and uniformly in a good sense, although the range of its application is wide. The essential idea of the root appears to be "weight." The phrase may therefore be supposed to answer to our expressive phrase, a "man of weight " <span class="accented">- the</span> weight being sometimes due <span class="accented">chiefly</span> to character, at other times to position and wealth in the first place, though not entirely divorced from considerations of character. We may safely judge, from what follows, that the intention in our present passage is to describe Jabez as a man of more ability and nobility than his brethren. It can scarcely be doubted that the meaning that lies on the surface is the correct interpretation, when it is said that his mother named him Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. The sorrow refers to unusual pains of travail, not to any attendant circumstances of domestic trial, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that the time of his birth was coincident with her own widowhood, as happened to the wife of Phinehas, when she named her offspring "Ichabod" (<a href="/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19-22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Jabez</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#8216;&#183;b&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3258.htm">Strong's 3258: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jabez -- a descendant of Judah, also a place in Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
