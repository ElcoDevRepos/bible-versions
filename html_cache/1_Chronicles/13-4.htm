This was a significant moment in Israel's history, as the Ark symbolized God's presence among His people. The phrase indicates a collective agreement among the Israelites, highlighting the unity and shared spiritual enthusiasm of the nation. This unity is reminiscent of other biblical moments where the people of Israel acted together, such as the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the rebuilding of the temple under Ezra and Nehemiah. The Ark had been neglected during Saul's reign, and David's initiative reflects a desire to restore proper worship and reverence for God.<p><b>the whole assembly agreed to it</b><br>The term "whole assembly" suggests a gathering of representatives from all tribes of Israel, indicating a national consensus. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where decisions were often made with the involvement of the community. The agreement of the assembly underscores the importance of collective decision-making in ancient Israelite culture, where leaders sought the counsel and approval of the people. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, who unites His followers in purpose and mission. The unity here foreshadows the unity of believers in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where the early church is described as being of one heart and mind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who initiated the plan to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem, demonstrating his desire to honor God and centralize worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_of_israel.htm">The Assembly of Israel</a></b><br>The collective gathering of the people of Israel who agreed with David's plan, showing unity and shared purpose in their spiritual journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that represented God's presence and covenant with Israel, which David sought to bring to Jerusalem to restore its central place in worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by David as the political and spiritual center of Israel, where he intended to bring the Ark to establish it as the heart of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-jearim.htm">Kiriath-jearim</a></b><br>The place where the Ark had been kept for many years before David's initiative to move it, highlighting a period of neglect in Israel's spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_purpose.htm">Unity in Purpose</a></b><br>The agreement of the assembly highlights the importance of unity in pursuing God's will.

In <a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-2</a> the same proposal is shown to arise from David&#8217;s heart for worship, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11</a> where God appoints a place for His Name.<p>&#8211; Scripture consistently encourages testing what &#8220;seems right&#8221; against God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; 14:12). Here, the proposal is rooted in prior commands about honoring the ark, so it enjoys divine approval.<p>&#8211; When a plan both honors God&#8217;s presence and matches His Word, it is legitimately &#8220;right.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to all the people</b><p>&#8211; David&#8217;s leadership included the voices of &#8220;all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt to Lebo-hamath&#8221; (1 Chron 13:5). He modeled <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a> and <a href="/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a> where leaders act openly before the congregation.<p>&#8211; Unity arose because the proposal resonated with shared memory: the ark had been neglected &#8220;during the days of Saul&#8221; (1 Chron 13:3).<p>&#8211; Genuine spiritual unity is never coerced; it comes when hearts are knit around God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8211; The verse underscores the vital role of congregational affirmation, echoing <a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a> where the people answered together, &#8220;We will do everything that the LORD has spoken.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the whole assembly agreed to it</b><p>&#8211; Agreement moved beyond sentiment to decisive commitment: they would go, carry, and celebrate (1 Chron 13:6-8).<p>&#8211; The phrase highlights corporate responsibility. Just as <a href="/joshua/24-24.htm">Joshua 24:24</a> records &#8220;The LORD our God we will serve,&#8221; here the nation publicly binds itself to act.<p>&#8211; This agreement also signals accountability; when everyone consents, everyone shares in the outcome&#8212;good or bad (compare <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2-4, 20</a>-24).<p>&#8211; The consensus paved the way for worship, yet the later incident with Uzzah (1 Chron 13:9-10) reminds us that human agreement never overrides God&#8217;s holiness. Obedience must continue after the vote.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/13-4.htm">1 Chronicles 13:4</a> shows a leader offering a God-honoring plan, a people discerning that it fits Scripture, and a united assembly committing themselves to act.
