The "God of their fathers" refers to the covenantal relationship established with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This unfaithfulness is a breach of the covenant, which required exclusive worship and obedience to Yahweh. The historical context here is the period of the divided kingdom, where idolatry and syncretism were rampant. This unfaithfulness is often compared to spiritual adultery, as seen in the prophetic books like Hosea, where Israel's relationship with God is likened to a marriage.<p><b>and they prostituted themselves with the gods of the peoples of the land</b><br>The use of the term "prostituted" is metaphorical, indicating spiritual infidelity and the pursuit of other deities. This phrase underscores the severity of Israel's sin, as they adopted the idolatrous practices of the surrounding nations, such as the Canaanites. These practices often included rituals that were abhorrent to God, such as child sacrifice and temple prostitution. The "gods of the peoples of the land" refers to the local deities like Baal and Asherah, which were worshipped through various pagan rites. This behavior is condemned throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>.<p><b>whom God had destroyed before them</b><br>This phrase recalls the conquest of Canaan, where God commanded the Israelites to drive out the inhabitants of the land due to their wickedness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The destruction of these peoples was both a judgment on their sin and a means to prevent Israel from being led astray by their idolatrous practices. The failure to fully obey God's command led to the Israelites being influenced by these very practices, as seen in <a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-36</a>.
