In the biblical context, King David is speaking during the assembly of Israel, recognizing that all material blessings and social status originate from God. This reflects the belief that God is the sovereign provider, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>, where it is stated that God gives the power to gain wealth. The acknowledgment of God as the source of riches and honor is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a>, which associates wisdom with long life, riches, and honor.<p><b>and You are the ruler over all</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty over the entire universe. The historical context of 1 Chronicles is during the reign of King David, a time when Israel was establishing itself as a nation under God's rule. The declaration of God as ruler over all is a central tenet of monotheism, contrasting with the polytheistic beliefs of surrounding nations. This sovereignty is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>, which states that God's kingdom rules over all. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ's ultimate authority, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where Jesus declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him.<p><b>In Your hands are power and might</b><br>This phrase highlights God's omnipotence, suggesting that all power and strength are under His control. The imagery of God's hands signifies His active involvement in the world, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God promises to uphold His people with His righteous right hand. The concept of divine power is central to the biblical narrative, from the creation account in Genesis to the miracles performed by Jesus in the Gospels. This power is not only creative but also redemptive, as demonstrated in the resurrection of Christ, which is the ultimate display of God's might.<p><b>to exalt and give strength to all</b><br>This phrase indicates God's ability to elevate and empower individuals according to His will. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, being exalted often meant being raised to a position of leadership or honor, as seen in the lives of figures like Joseph and David. The idea of God giving strength is a recurring theme in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a>, where God is described as the one who arms with strength. This empowerment is not limited to physical strength but includes spiritual fortitude, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul declares that he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. The phrase also points to the future hope of believers being exalted with Christ, as promised in <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, King David, is addressing God in a prayer of praise and thanksgiving as he prepares for the construction of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is the context in which this prayer is offered, as David is gathering resources for the temple that his son Solomon will build.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_preparation.htm">Temple Preparation</a></b><br>This event marks the preparation for the building of the temple, a significant moment in Israel's history, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate ruler over all creation.
