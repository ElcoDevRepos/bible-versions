This method was used to distribute the land among the tribes (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>) and to select individuals for specific roles or tasks (<a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41-42</a>). It underscores the belief in divine sovereignty over human affairs.<p><b>the cities named above</b><br>This refers to the cities previously listed in the chapter, which were allocated to the Levites. The Levites, being the priestly tribe, did not receive a contiguous territory like the other tribes but were given specific cities within the territories of other tribes (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). This ensured their presence and priestly duties were spread throughout Israel.<p><b>from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin</b><br>These tribes were located in the southern part of Israel. Judah was the largest and most prominent tribe, from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>). Simeon was initially allocated land within Judah's territory (<a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>), indicating a close relationship between these tribes. Benjamin, though smaller, was significant as the tribe of King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>) and later the Apostle Paul (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). The inclusion of these tribes highlights the geographical and tribal diversity of the Levitical cities, ensuring the Levites' influence and service were accessible to all Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service in the temple.

Though seemingly random, the outcome expresses the Lord&#8217;s sovereign choice (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>).<p>- Thus, the verse reminds us that God guides even ordinary administrative tasks. Every portion of land, every home for a priestly family, comes from His hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the cities named above</b><p>- The &#8220;cities&#8221; refer to those listed in the previous verses (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-57.htm">1 Chronicles 6:57-64</a>), the same locations recorded earlier in <a href="/bsb/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>.<p>- These towns include pasturelands so the Levites can raise flocks and meet daily needs (<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a>).<p>- By providing designated cities, God ensures that the Levites&#8212;who receive no territorial inheritance like the other tribes&#8212;still have a secure place to live, serve, and teach His Word (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: when God calls people to special service, He also supplies what they need to fulfill that calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin</b><p>- The Levites do not form an isolated eleventh tribe; they live among all Israel. Here the focus is on Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin&#8212;tribes clustered around Jerusalem, the future center of worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-14</a>).<p>- Judah&#8217;s prominence (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>) and Benjamin&#8217;s proximity place priests and singers near the Temple site long before Solomon builds it.<p>- Simeon&#8217;s territory, scattered within Judah (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>), further intertwines priestly influence with daily life throughout the southern region.<p>- This arrangement fulfills Moses&#8217; blessing: &#8220;They will teach Your ordinances to Jacob and Your law to Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>), keeping God&#8217;s Word accessible to every household.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-65.htm">1 Chronicles 6:65</a> shows the Lord faithfully distributing places of ministry to His servants.
