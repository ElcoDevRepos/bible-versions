The number 212 indicates a well-organized system, reflecting the importance of order in worship. Gatekeepers were responsible for controlling access to the temple, ensuring that only those who were ceremonially clean could enter. This role can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate gatekeeper, providing access to God (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p><b>They were registered by genealogy in their villages.</b><br>Genealogical records were vital for maintaining tribal and familial identities, especially after the Babylonian exile. This registration ensured that the gatekeepers were Levites, as only Levites were permitted to serve in the temple (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). The emphasis on genealogy underscores the continuity of God's covenant promises to Israel, as well as the importance of heritage and lineage in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>David and Samuel the seer had appointed them to their positions of trust.</b><br>David and Samuel's involvement highlights the divine guidance in establishing temple worship. Samuel, as a prophet, and David, as a king, represent the prophetic and kingly offices that point to Christ, who fulfills both roles. Their appointment of gatekeepers signifies the importance of divine order and leadership in worship. This historical context shows the transition from the tabernacle to the temple, with David preparing for the temple Solomon would build.

He died before David's accession (<a href="/1_samuel/25-1.htm" title="And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.">1Samuel 25:1</a>). Tradition doubtless associated him with David in the work of religious reform, and from what is known of his relation to the sovereigns of his day, the statement of the text may be held true in spirit, if not in the letter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seer</span>. It is to be noticed that the compiler of Chronicles uses elsewhere, as here, the "aforetime" name of the prophet, according to <a href="/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>. Note in this verse the linking together of the names of David and Samuel, to the ignoring of that of Saul. <span class="cmt_word">In their set office</span>. Keil would translate, "Upon their fidelity, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because they had been found faithful." But our margin translates happily, "in their trust," which will include, in part, the thought of Keil, and will suit our ver. 26. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The number</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(kul&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
