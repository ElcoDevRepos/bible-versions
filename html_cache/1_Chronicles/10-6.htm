His death is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>, where it was foretold that Saul and his sons would die in battle. Saul's demise serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commands.<p><b>together with his three sons</b><br>The death of Saul's sons, including Jonathan, is significant as it represents the end of Saul's lineage and the potential continuation of his dynasty. Jonathan, in particular, was a close friend of David and a man of faith and integrity. Their deaths in battle against the Philistines highlight the severe consequences of Saul's failures as a leader and his inability to secure God's favor for his family.<p><b>and all his house</b><br>This phrase indicates the complete downfall of Saul's household, emphasizing the totality of the judgment against him. It reflects the biblical principle that the sins of a leader can have devastating effects on their family and followers. The destruction of Saul's house paves the way for David's rise to kingship, aligning with God's covenantal promise to establish David's line, which ultimately leads to the coming of Jesus Christ, the eternal King from the line of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

(<a href="/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">1 Chronicles 10:6</a>) brings the story of Israel&#8217;s first king to a sober close.<p>&#8226; The chronicler echoes <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4&#8211;6</a>, confirming a literal death on Mount Gilboa.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13&#8211;14</a> explains the cause: Saul&#8217;s unfaithfulness, consulting a medium, and failing to obey the LORD.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s fall fulfills Samuel&#8217;s earlier warning (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13&#8211;14</a>) that disobedience would cost him the kingdom.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores the certainty of God&#8217;s judgment: even a king is not exempt (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with his three sons</b><p>The text names Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua (<a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8212;known for faith and loyalty to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1&#8211;4</a>)&#8212;dies beside his father, showing that the faithful may suffer in a fallen world.<p>&#8226; The united death of the royal sons highlights how a leader&#8217;s choices ripple through his family (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/romans/14-7.htm">Romans 14:7</a>).<p>&#8226; It also clears the path for David&#8217;s unchallenged succession (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all his house</b><p>&#8220;All his house&#8221; points to the collapse of Saul&#8217;s dynasty.<p>&#8226; Though some relatives survive (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; 4:4), the royal line itself ends here&#8212;no son remains to claim the throne.<p>&#8226; This fulfills the divine verdict that Saul&#8217;s kingdom would not endure (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The transfer of kingship to David is underscored in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1&#8211;3</a>, where &#8220;all Israel&#8221; anoints David, contrasting Saul&#8217;s fallen house with David&#8217;s rising one (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s brevity&#8212;only 14 verses on Saul&#8212;keeps the focus on God&#8217;s covenant plan moving forward through David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">1 Chronicles 10:6</a> records the total collapse of Saul&#8217;s reign: the king, his sons, and his dynasty perish in one decisive moment. The verse shows that God&#8217;s word of judgment is certain, that a leader&#8217;s sin can devastate a family, and that the stage is now set for the rise of David, through whom God will advance His redemptive purposes for Israel and the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And all his house died together.</span>--Instead of this Samuel reads "and his armour-bearer; also all his men on that day together." The LXX. adds "on that day" here, while in Samuel it omits "all his men," thus minimising the differences of text. It is mere pedantry to press the phrases "all his men," "all his house." The strength of these expressions indicates the completeness of the overthrow.<p>The chronicler was fully aware that some of Saul's house were not engaged in this battle (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-35.htm" title="And in Gibeon dwelled the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:">1Chronicles 9:35</a>). And in any case, the chief warriors of his household, and immediate followers, died with the king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All his house</span>. In place of these words, the parallel (<a href="/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>) has, "And his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together." This reading avoids the ambiguity referred to already (ver. 2). In either passage the moral is plain, that the end and ruin of Saul's family as a whole had arrived, rather than literally that the whole, including every member, of that family had perished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">died</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">together</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7717;&#183;d&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3162.htm">Strong's 3162: </a> </span><span class="str2">A unit, unitedly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with his three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
