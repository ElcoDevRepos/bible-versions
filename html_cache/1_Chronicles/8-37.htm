This lineage highlights the continuation of Saul's family despite his tragic end. Binea, as Moza's son, represents the ongoing legacy and fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a remnant of Saul's line. This genealogy underscores the importance of family heritage in Israelite culture, where lineage often determined one's social and religious standing.<p><b>Raphah was his son,</b><br>Raphah, also known as Rephaiah in some translations, is part of the genealogical record that traces the descendants of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The name Raphah means "healed" or "recovered," which may symbolize restoration or continuity within the family line. This connection to the tribe of Benjamin is significant, as Benjamin was the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, and his descendants played crucial roles in Israel's history.<p><b>Eleasah his son,</b><br>Eleasah, meaning "God has made," is a name that reflects the theocentric worldview of the Israelites, where names often carried theological significance. This name may indicate a recognition of God's sovereignty and providence in the continuation of the family line. The mention of Eleasah in the genealogy serves to maintain the historical record of Saul's descendants, emphasizing the importance of each generation in the unfolding narrative of Israel.<p><b>and Azel his son.</b><br>Azel, whose name means "noble" or "reserved," is the final descendant listed in this particular genealogical segment. The inclusion of Azel highlights the meticulous record-keeping of the Israelites, ensuring that each member of the family line is remembered. This attention to detail in genealogies serves to connect the past with the present, providing a sense of identity and continuity for the people of Israel. The genealogical records in Chronicles often serve to remind the Israelites of their heritage and God's faithfulness throughout generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moza.htm">Moza</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Moza is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin.
