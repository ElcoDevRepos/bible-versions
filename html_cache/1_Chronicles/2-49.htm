Madmannah is a location in the Negev region, south of Judah, indicating the territorial expansion and settlement of Caleb's descendants. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the tribes of Israel. The mention of Shaaph as the "father" of Madmannah suggests a founding or significant role in the establishment of this settlement, highlighting the importance of lineage and inheritance in Israelite culture.<p><b>and of Sheva father of Machbenah and Gibea</b><br>Sheva is another descendant of Caleb, and his mention as the "father" of Machbenah and Gibea suggests his role in establishing or leading these places. Machbenah and Gibea are less well-known locations, but their inclusion signifies the spread and influence of Caleb's lineage. This reflects the broader narrative of the Israelites settling and organizing the Promised Land. The emphasis on these familial connections underscores the importance of tribal identity and heritage in maintaining the covenant community.<p><b>Caleb&#8217;s daughter was Acsah</b><br>Acsah is a notable figure in the biblical narrative, known for her marriage to Othniel, Caleb's nephew, as recorded in <a href="/joshua/15-16.htm">Joshua 15:16-19</a> and <a href="/judges/1-12.htm">Judges 1:12-15</a>. Her story highlights themes of inheritance and the role of women in securing family legacy. Acsah's request for springs of water from her father Caleb demonstrates her assertiveness and the value of resource-rich land in the arid region of Judah.

Scripture does not hide the complexities of real families, yet it faithfully traces the line of promise through them. Maacah&#8217;s name is recorded because God values and remembers the women who further His covenant line, just as He did with Tamar (<a href="/genesis/38-6.htm">Genesis 38:6-30</a>) and Rahab (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). Their inclusion underlines the literal reliability of the genealogy and reminds us that every person&#8212;male or female&#8212;matters to the unfolding of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>father of Madmannah</b><p>Shaaph is called the &#8220;father of Madmannah,&#8221; an Old Testament way of saying he founded or led the clan that settled that town (cf. 1 Chron 2:21-23; <a href="/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Madmannah lay in the southern Judean Negev (<a href="/joshua/15-31.htm">Joshua 15:31</a>), an arid fringe that required faith and hard work to tame.<p>&#8226; By listing the settlement, the text demonstrates how Caleb&#8217;s descendants actually occupied the land God had sworn to give him (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-14.htm">Joshua 14:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Each named town is a historical stake in the ground, reinforcing that God&#8217;s promises are fulfilled in verifiable geography.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of Sheva father of Machbenah and Gibea</b><p>Sheva&#8217;s line produced two towns, showing additional expansion of Caleb&#8217;s clan. Multiple settlements echo God&#8217;s blessing of fruitfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>). Although Machbenah is otherwise unknown and Gibea likely corresponds to a Judean highland village (compare <a href="/joshua/15-57.htm">Joshua 15:57</a>), their mere mention affirms that no detail of covenant history is lost. Similar phrases appear throughout the chapter (e.g., &#8220;father of Ziph,&#8221; 1 Chron 2:42), knitting together a map of Judah&#8217;s interior that would be meaningful to the chronicler&#8217;s original audience returning from exile (<a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Caleb&#8217;s daughter was Acsah</b><p>Acsah shines elsewhere in Scripture:<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/15-16.htm">Joshua 15:16-19</a> and <a href="/judges/1-12.htm">Judges 1:12-15</a> recount her marriage to Othniel and her bold request for &#8220;springs of water,&#8221; which Caleb granted&#8212;&#8220;So he gave her the upper and lower springs&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Her story highlights faith-filled initiative and the willingness of a father to bless his daughter, paralleling God&#8217;s own generosity (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Alongside the daughters of Zelophehad (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-7</a>), Acsah illustrates that women rightfully inherit within God&#8217;s economy&#8212;a truth echoed in the New Covenant, where &#8220;there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-49.htm">1 Chronicles 2:49</a> records real people, real towns, and real inheritance, proving that God&#8217;s promises to Caleb were tangibly kept.
