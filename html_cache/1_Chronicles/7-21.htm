The mention of Zabad and Shuthelah emphasizes the importance of genealogies in chronicling the tribes of Israel. Genealogies served to establish identity, inheritance rights, and fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs. Shuthelah is also mentioned in <a href="/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>, indicating the persistence of his lineage within the tribe of Ephraim.<p><b>Ezer and Elead were killed by the natives of Gath,</b><br>Ezer and Elead, also descendants of Ephraim, met their demise at the hands of the Philistines from Gath. Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities, known for its formidable warriors, including Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>). This incident reflects the ongoing hostilities between the Israelites and the Philistines, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel, often engaging in battles and raids.<p><b>because they went down to steal their livestock.</b><br>The act of stealing livestock indicates a time of economic hardship or desperation, possibly due to famine or conflict. Livestock was a valuable resource, essential for sustenance and trade. This event underscores the moral and ethical challenges faced by the Israelites, as well as the consequences of their actions. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of coveting and taking what belongs to others, echoing the commandment against stealing (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zabad.htm">Zabad</a></b><br>A descendant in the lineage of Ephraim, one of the sons of Joseph.
