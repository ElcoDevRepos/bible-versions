Zeruiah is often noted for her sons, who played significant roles in David's military campaigns. Abigail, not to be confused with David's wife of the same name, is less prominently featured in the biblical narrative. The mention of sisters in genealogies is relatively rare, indicating their significance. This reflects the cultural context where family connections were crucial for social and political alliances.<p><b>And the three sons of Zeruiah were Abishai, Joab, and Asahel.</b><br>Zeruiah's sons were prominent figures in King David's reign. Abishai was known for his bravery and loyalty to David, often accompanying him in dangerous situations. Joab, the most famous of the three, served as the commander of David's army and was instrumental in many of David's military victories. However, Joab's actions were sometimes controversial, as he was involved in the deaths of Abner and Absalom, which were against David's wishes. Asahel, known for his swiftness, was killed by Abner, which led to a prolonged conflict between the house of David and the house of Saul. The roles of these men highlight the turbulent and often violent nature of David's rise to power and the establishment of his kingdom. Their stories are interwoven with themes of loyalty, justice, and the complexities of leadership, which are echoed throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zeruiah.htm">Zeruiah</a></b><br>A sister of David, known for being the mother of three of David's mighty warriors.

So Scripture highlights that Jesse had at least two daughters in addition to his eight sons.<p>&#8226; Mentioning the sisters puts the whole family in view; God values every member, not just the famous ones (compare <a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> where daughters are also noted).<p>&#8226; Zeruiah and Abigail become key because of the pivotal roles their children will play alongside David, Jesse&#8217;s youngest (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the three sons of Zeruiah</b><p>&#8226; Unlike many Old Testament genealogies that trace lineage through fathers, here we follow a matriarch.

Light is thrown upon this by <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, which says that Abigail was the daughter of one Nahash, and that Zeruiah was her sister. But it is to leave us in greater darkness as to who Nahath was: whether Nahath was another name for Jesse, or the name of Jesse's wife, or the name of a former husband of Jesse's wife, to whom she bore these two daughters before she became wife to Jesse, and that former husband possibly none other than the Ammonite king (<a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>) - or whether none of these conjectures be near the truth, some of which on the face of them seem unlikely enough, is as yet unsettled. Meantime it is worth remembering that Zeruiah named one of her celebrated sons, and probably the eldest of them, <span class="cmt_word">Abishai</span>, after Jesse, Ishai being the same as our Jesse; yet from the above premises it is taken that she was strictly sister of Abigail, and therefore was not really related to Jesse. The subject is treated interestingly under the various names in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary.' The husband of Zeruiah is given nowhere, while the husband of Abigail, here called <span class="cmt_word">Jether the Ishmeelite</span>, is, in the passage already referred to (<a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), called Ithra (which is a slightly altered form of the name), an <span class="accented">Israelite</span>, with little doubt an error for <span class="accented">Ishmaelite.</span> In the same passage also her own name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, though many manuscripts have this latter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their sisters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
