David, as the anointed king, sought to consolidate the nation both politically and spiritually. Baalah of Judah, also known as Kiriath-jearim, was a significant location because the Ark of the Covenant had been there since the time of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). The journey "up" indicates the elevation of the region, as Kiriath-jearim is situated in the hill country of Judah. This reflects the importance of the Ark and the reverence with which it was approached.<p><b>(that is, Kiriath-jearim)</b><br>Kiriath-jearim, meaning "City of Forests," was a Gibeonite city (<a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>) and had been the resting place of the Ark for about 20 years after it was returned by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-21.htm">1 Samuel 6:21-7</a>:2). This city was strategically located on the border of Judah and Benjamin, making it accessible to the tribes of Israel. The mention of both names underscores the historical and geographical significance of the location.<p><b>to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people. David's desire to bring the Ark to Jerusalem was a move to establish the city as the religious and political center of Israel. This act was not just a political maneuver but a spiritual one, signifying the centrality of God in the life of the nation. The Ark's movement also foreshadows the future establishment of the temple in Jerusalem.<p><b>who is enthroned between the cherubim</b><br>This phrase refers to the mercy seat on the Ark, where two cherubim faced each other with wings outstretched. It was here that God's presence was believed to dwell (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). The imagery of God being "enthroned" between the cherubim emphasizes His sovereignty and holiness. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>, reinforcing the idea of God's divine kingship and His intimate presence with His people.<p><b>the ark that is called by the Name</b><br>The "Name" refers to the sacred and covenantal name of God, Yahweh. The Ark was not just a religious artifact; it was intrinsically linked to God's identity and His relationship with Israel. The reverence for the Name underscores the holiness and power associated with the Ark. This connection between the Ark and God's Name is a reminder of the covenant promises and the need for Israel to honor and obey God. The Ark as a type of Christ can be seen in how it represents God's presence and the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus, who is the ultimate revelation of God's Name and presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_israel.htm">All Israel</a></b><br>Represents the collective participation of the nation in this significant religious event, highlighting unity and shared purpose.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baalah_of_judah.htm">Baalah of Judah (Kiriath-jearim)</a></b><br>The location where the Ark of the Covenant had been kept after being returned by the Philistines.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_god.htm">Ark of God</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Law, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_enthroned_between_the_cherubim.htm">The LORD enthroned between the cherubim</a></b><br>A reference to God's divine presence and authority, symbolized by the Ark's design.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The Ark symbolizes God's holy presence.

The original text was plainly the same, whether the chronicler drew directly from the Book of Samuel, or from another source. Such differences as appear consist of abridgments, paraphrases, and corrections.<p><span class= "bld">All Israel.</span>--Samuel, "All the people that were with him."<p><span class= "bld">To Baalah.</span>--<a href="/joshua/15-60.htm" title="Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:60</a>, "Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim." "Baa?s town" was doubtless the original name. "Town of woods" describes the position of the place. Our text appears more correct than that of Samuel, which has, "And David rose and went, and all the people that were with him, from BaaleJudah." The Targum, LXX., and Syriac, translate that which the Authorised Version gives as a proper name, "The people that were with him of the cities lords men of Judah." If this be right, perhaps "Baalah" has fallen out of the text of Samuel owing to its resemblance to the word <span class= "ital">baale</span>. lords.

We read in <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17-27</a> how the men of Kirjath-jearim had been made by Joshua "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord." Hither to this Kirjath-jearim the ark had been conveyed from Bethshemesh (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>), and here it "abode" long time, "for it was twenty years." Perhaps the word "abode" in this passage may be equivalent to abode <span class="accented">unmoved</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>.18, 19). For though the chronology from the death of Eli, through the remainder of Samuel's career and of Saul's, seems almost hopelessly uncertain, yet it would appear certain that the interval exceeded twenty years, to the time that David now takes in hand to bring home, as it were, the ark. <span class="cmt_word">The ark of God, the Lord</span>. Though the Authorized Version of this passage is better and cleverer than that of the parallel (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>), yet it is left somewhat obscure. The comma should follow the name God. Jehovah sitting upon the cherubim then follows as a clause in apposition, while the last three words (<span class="accented">as the name is called</span>, rather than whose name) state that clause to contain "the Name of the Lord" (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-8.htm">1 Samuel 6:8</a>).
