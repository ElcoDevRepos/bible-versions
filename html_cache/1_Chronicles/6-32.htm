The tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey and until the construction of the temple. This phrase underscores the continuity of worship practices from the time of Moses. The use of music in worship is seen throughout the Bible, with David being a key figure in organizing musical worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>). The tabernacle was a temporary structure, symbolizing God's presence among His people, and the Levites' role in leading worship through song was crucial in maintaining the spiritual life of the community.<p><b>until Solomon built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem</b><br>This marks a significant transition from the temporary tabernacle to the permanent temple built by Solomon, which became the central place of worship. The temple in Jerusalem was a fulfillment of God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>) and represented a more established and enduring presence of God among His people. The construction of the temple signified a new era in Israel's history, with Jerusalem becoming the spiritual and political center. This transition also reflects the shift from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled nation under a monarchy.<p><b>And they performed their duties according to the regulations given them</b><br>The Levites' duties were prescribed by God, emphasizing the importance of order and obedience in worship. These regulations were detailed in the Law of Moses, particularly in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. The Levites were responsible for various aspects of worship, including music, sacrifices, and the maintenance of the tabernacle and later the temple. Their adherence to these regulations ensured that worship was conducted in a manner pleasing to God, reflecting His holiness and the need for His people to approach Him with reverence. This obedience to divine instructions is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the importance of following God's commands in all aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi was set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle and later the temple.
