However, the Ehud mentioned here is likely a different individual, as the genealogies in Chronicles often refer to lesser-known figures. This highlights the importance of family lineage and heritage in Israelite society, emphasizing the continuity of God's people through generations.<p><b>who were the heads of the families</b><br>In ancient Israel, family heads held significant authority and responsibility. They were leaders within their tribes and clans, responsible for maintaining order, justice, and religious practices. This structure reflects the patriarchal nature of Israelite society, where lineage and inheritance were crucial for maintaining tribal identity and land ownership.<p><b>living in Geba</b><br>Geba was a town in the territory of Benjamin, located north of Jerusalem. It served as a strategic military location and was one of the Levitical cities (<a href="/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>). Its mention here indicates the geographical distribution of the Benjamite tribe and their settlements. Geba's proximity to Jerusalem also suggests its importance in the defense and religious life of the nation.<p><b>and were exiled to Manahath</b><br>The exile to Manahath suggests a forced relocation, possibly due to political or military pressures. Manahath's exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of Judah. This movement of people reflects the turbulent history of the tribes of Israel, often affected by external threats and internal conflicts. The exile theme resonates with the broader biblical narrative of displacement and return, seen in the Babylonian exile and the eventual restoration of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A significant figure in Israel's history, Ehud was a judge who delivered Israel from Moabite oppression.
