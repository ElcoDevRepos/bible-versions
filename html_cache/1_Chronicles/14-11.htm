This event occurs after David has established his rule in Jerusalem, and the Philistines, long-time adversaries of Israel, seek to challenge his kingship. The geographical setting is significant as Baal-perazim is believed to be near the Valley of Rephaim, southwest of Jerusalem. This area was a strategic location for military engagements. David's leadership and reliance on God are central themes, as he consistently seeks divine guidance before engaging in battle.<p><b>where he defeated the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a formidable enemy of Israel, known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry, including iron chariots. David's victory over them at Baal-perazim is a testament to his military skill and God's favor upon him. This victory is part of a series of battles where David successfully subdues the Philistines, securing Israel's borders and establishing peace. The defeat of the Philistines also fulfills God's promise to deliver Israel from their enemies, as seen in earlier scriptures.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.&#8221;</b><br>David attributes his victory to God, using the metaphor of a "bursting flood" to describe the overwhelming and decisive nature of the triumph. This imagery reflects the sudden and powerful intervention of God, reminiscent of the Red Sea crossing where God delivered Israel from Egypt. The phrase "by my hand" indicates that while David was the instrument, the victory was ultimately God's doing. This acknowledgment of divine intervention is a recurring theme in David's life, emphasizing his dependence on God.<p><b>So they called that place Baal-perazim</b><br>The naming of the place as Baal-perazim, meaning "Lord of Breakthroughs," serves as a memorial to God's intervention and victory. In biblical tradition, naming places after significant events was a way to commemorate God's acts and ensure that future generations would remember His faithfulness. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the naming of Bethel by Jacob. Baal-perazim stands as a testament to God's power to break through obstacles and deliver His people, foreshadowing the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his leadership, military prowess, and deep relationship with God.
