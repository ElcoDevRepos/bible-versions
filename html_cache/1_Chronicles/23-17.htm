This lineage highlights the continuation of Moses' family line, emphasizing the importance of priestly and Levitical roles in Israel's religious life. Eliezer's descendants were part of the Levites, who were set apart for service in the tabernacle and later the temple. This connection underscores the enduring legacy of Moses' family in the spiritual leadership of Israel.<p><b>Rehabiah was the first.</b><br>Rehabiah, as the firstborn, would have held a position of prominence and responsibility within his family. In ancient Israelite culture, the firstborn son often received a double portion of the inheritance and was expected to lead the family. This mention signifies the continuation of Eliezer's line through Rehabiah, ensuring the family's ongoing contribution to the Levitical duties.<p><b>Eliezer did not have any other sons,</b><br>This detail highlights the unique position of Rehabiah as the sole heir of Eliezer. In biblical narratives, the absence of multiple sons can sometimes indicate a special divine purpose or blessing on the single heir. It also emphasizes the importance of Rehabiah's role in carrying on the family name and responsibilities.<p><b>but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.</b><br>The numerous descendants of Rehabiah suggest a fulfillment of God's promises of fruitfulness and multiplication to His people. This abundance can be seen as a blessing, ensuring that the Levitical duties and the spiritual heritage of Moses' family would continue robustly. It also reflects the growth and expansion of the Levitical families, which was necessary for the increasing needs of temple service as Israel's population grew.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliezer.htm">Eliezer</a></b><br>A son of Moses, Eliezer is mentioned here as the father of Rehabiah.

Now, v. 17 focuses on the younger line. Scripture never treats these lists as dry statistics; they preserve God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant people. In <a href="/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a> Moses explained the choice of Eliezer&#8217;s name: &#8220;for he said, &#8216;My father&#8217;s God was my helper.&#8217;&#8221; By recording Eliezer&#8217;s offspring here, the chronicler confirms that the God who helped Moses also sustained Moses&#8217; lineage, ensuring that even the non-priestly branch of his family would have a place among the Levites serving in David&#8217;s kingdom (cf. <a href="/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-24.htm">1 Chronicles 26:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rehabiah was the first</b><p>The verse continues: &#8220;Rehabiah was the first.&#8221; In Hebrew narrative the firstborn often receives special responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). Although this family would not carry the high-priestly authority given to Aaron&#8217;s descendants, Rehabiah&#8217;s position signaled leadership within the clan. Later, <a href="/1_chronicles/24-21.htm">1 Chronicles 24:21</a> mentions &#8220;the sons of Rehabiah&#8221; when David organizes temple duties, indicating that Rehabiah&#8217;s line indeed took on recognized roles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eliezer did not have any other sons</b><p>We read next: &#8220;Eliezer did not have any other sons.&#8221; The statement feels stark, especially when Old-Testament families prized numerous children (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>). Humanly speaking, a solitary male heir could threaten a family&#8217;s longevity. Yet the chronicler is about to underline how the Lord can override such limitations, just as He did with Abraham&#8217;s single son Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) or with Hannah&#8217;s once-barren womb (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>). Divine providence, not sheer numbers, secures the future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous</b><p>Finally, the writer turns that apparent weakness into a testimony: &#8220;but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.&#8221; God multiplied what seemed small, echoing the creation mandate, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), and Israel&#8217;s rapid growth in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>). By David&#8217;s day, Rehabiah&#8217;s many descendants could supply sizeable teams for temple treasury oversight (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-25.htm">1 Chronicles 26:25</a>) and other Levitical tasks (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-14.htm">2 Chronicles 31:14</a>). The phrase illustrates a pattern: when God determines to bless a lineage for His service, He provides every resource&#8212;including people&#8212;to accomplish His purposes (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-14.htm">Psalm 115:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-17.htm">1 Chronicles 23:17</a> highlights the surprising way God established Moses&#8217; family within the Levitical structure. Though Eliezer had only one son, that single branch&#8212;Rehabiah&#8212;flourished so abundantly that it met the nation&#8217;s worship needs in David&#8217;s generation and beyond. The verse therefore teaches that numerical limitations never hinder God&#8217;s plan; He can multiply any faithful line for His glory and for the ongoing ministry of His house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief.</span>--The word "were" (became) ought not to be in italics in the text, as it is expressed in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">The chief</span> (head) means founder and eponym of the clan the sons of Rehabiah.<p><span class= "bld">And Eliezer had none other sons.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And there became not to Eliezer ether sons, and the sons of Rehabiah had multiplied exceedingly</span> (<span class= "ital">unto height,</span> <a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm" title="And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it.

The clan Rehabiah was very populous.<p>Thus (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/23-16.htm" title="Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.">1Chronicles 23:16-17</a>) the descendants of Moses were comprised in two father-houses, or clans, viz., Shebuel and Rehabiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rehabiah</span>.
