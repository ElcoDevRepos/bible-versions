In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23</a>, David is organizing the Levites for service in the temple. The Levites were descendants of Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and were chosen by God for specific roles related to worship and the tabernacle, later the temple.<p><b>said David,</b><br>David, the second king of Israel, is speaking here. He is known for uniting the tribes of Israel and establishing Jerusalem as the nation's capital. David's preparation for the temple, which his son Solomon would build, shows his dedication to worship and the centrality of God in the life of Israel. David's leadership and organizational skills are evident as he sets the stage for the temple's construction and operation.<p><b>24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD,</b><br>This large number indicates the importance and scale of the temple operations. The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was to be the central place of worship for Israel. The Levites' role in overseeing the work highlights their responsibility in maintaining the temple's sanctity and ensuring that worship was conducted according to God's commands. This organization reflects the order and structure God desires in worship, as seen in the detailed instructions for the tabernacle in Exodus.<p><b>6,000 are to be officers and judges,</b><br>These Levites were assigned roles that extended beyond temple service to include governance and justice. As officers and judges, they would have been responsible for maintaining order and upholding the law among the people. This reflects the broader role of the Levites in Israelite society, serving not only in religious capacities but also in civil and judicial functions. The connection to other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>, where the Levites are involved in legal matters, underscores their integral role in the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who organized the Levites for service in the temple.

He counts 38,000 Levites who are thirty years old and up (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>). By saying &#8220;of these,&#8221; he narrows that total into specialized roles. The careful enumeration reminds us that God values order and intentional assignment (cf. <a href="/numbers/4-49.htm">Numbers 4:49</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; These 24,000 constitute the bulk of the Levites, dedicated to hands-on ministry in and around the temple&#8212;maintaining sacred utensils, guarding entrances, preparing offerings (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Their task points forward to New-Covenant believers who are called &#8220;a holy priesthood&#8221; to serve God daily (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; David assigns such a large number because worship is not occasional; it is continuous (<a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;house of the LORD&#8221; anticipates Solomon&#8217;s temple, yet David organizes beforehand, showing faith that what God promises He will surely accomplish (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;6,000 are to be officers and judges&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; These Levites handle administration and justice, applying God&#8217;s law among the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; By appointing Levites&#8212;men steeped in Scripture&#8212;David ensures that civil matters line up with divine standards (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence in every region (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>) spreads godly wisdom beyond Jerusalem, echoing the call for believers to &#8220;teach all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The 6,000 reinforce that worship and justice belong together; true devotion to God shapes fair dealings with people (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a> records David&#8217;s Spirit-led organization of the Levites: 24,000 devoted to continual temple service and 6,000 devoted to righteous administration.
