The number six may signify completeness in terms of human effort, as the Levites were responsible for guarding the temple gates. This duty reflects the importance of vigilance and dedication in spiritual service. The east gate was also known as the King's Gate, emphasizing the need for heightened security and reverence.<p><b>four on the north</b><br>The north side of the temple was less prominent than the east but still required protection. The number four often symbolizes universality or completeness in the Bible, suggesting that the temple was to be guarded from all directions. This allocation of Levites underscores the comprehensive nature of their duty, ensuring that every part of the temple was secure. The north side may also represent the hidden or less visible aspects of spiritual life that still require attention and care.<p><b>four on the south</b><br>The south side, like the north, was guarded by four Levites, maintaining balance and symmetry in the temple's protection. The south is often associated with warmth and light, as it receives more sunlight. This could symbolize the need to guard the spiritual warmth and vitality of the community. The consistent number of guards on both the north and south sides highlights the equal importance of all aspects of spiritual vigilance.<p><b>and two pairs at the storehouse</b><br>The storehouse was a critical area, as it contained the temple's treasures and offerings. The presence of two pairs of Levites suggests a heightened level of security and accountability, as pairs could watch over each other and ensure integrity in handling sacred items. This arrangement reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and the need for faithful management of God's resources. The storehouse can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate treasure and provision for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties and temple service in Israel.
