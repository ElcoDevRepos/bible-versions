The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects. This lineage emphasizes the importance of maintaining the purity and continuity of the priestly line, which was crucial for the religious life of Israel. The name Tahath means "station" or "encampment," possibly indicating a role or position within the Levitical duties.<p><b>Uriel his son</b><br>Uriel, meaning "God is my light," is another link in the genealogical chain of the Levites. The name reflects a common theme in Hebrew names, where the character and attributes of God are highlighted. Uriel's inclusion in this genealogy underscores the continuity of the Levitical service and the importance of each generation in maintaining the worship and service of God. This name also appears in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5</a>, where Uriel is a leader of the Kohathites during the time of King David.<p><b>Uzziah his son</b><br>Uzziah, meaning "my strength is Yahweh," continues the lineage of the Levites. This name is shared with other notable biblical figures, such as King Uzziah of Judah, indicating its popularity and the cultural emphasis on divine strength and reliance on God. The presence of Uzziah in this genealogy highlights the enduring legacy of the Levitical priesthood and its role in Israel's spiritual life. The name itself serves as a reminder of the source of true strength and leadership.<p><b>Shaul his son</b><br>Shaul, meaning "asked for" or "prayed for," concludes this segment of the genealogy. This name is also associated with the first king of Israel, Saul, though the contexts are different. The inclusion of Shaul in the Levitical line emphasizes the diversity and reach of the Levitical families throughout Israel's history. It also reflects the practice of naming children with the hope or expectation of divine intervention or blessing, a common cultural practice in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tahath.htm">Tahath</a></b><br>A descendant in the Levitical line, specifically from the Kohathites, who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriel.htm">Uriel</a></b><br>Son of Tahath, continuing the Levitical lineage, which emphasizes the importance of family heritage in priestly duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>Son of Uriel, part of the genealogical record that underscores the continuity of God's covenant with the Levites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaul.htm">Shaul</a></b><br>Son of Uzziah, marking the generational faithfulness and the role of the Levites in Israel's worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_heritage.htm">The Importance of Heritage</a></b><br>The genealogical records in Chronicles remind us of the significance of spiritual heritage and the responsibility to pass down faith to future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_across_generations.htm">Faithfulness Across Generations</a></b><br>The continuity of names reflects the faithfulness of God and the importance of remaining faithful to His calling across generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_levites.htm">Role of the Levites</a></b><br>Understanding the specific roles of the Levites helps us appreciate the structure and order God established for worship, which can inspire us to serve faithfully in our own roles within the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_covenant_with_his_people.htm">God's Covenant with His People</a></b><br>The genealogies underscore God's unchanging covenant with His people, encouraging us to trust in His promises and remain steadfast in our faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_6_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 6:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Chron_6_24_Genealogies_significance.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 6:24 highlight the importance of genealogies in Scripture?

Tahath&#8217;s name confirms the line remained intact.<p>- &#8220;He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach their children&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5</a>). Tahath&#8217;s entry proves that command was being honored from one generation to the next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Uriel his son</b><p>- Uriel&#8217;s placement highlights that holy service passes from father to son in obedience to <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>.<p>- A later Uriel helped carry the ark to Jerusalem (1 Chron 15:11&#8211;12), showing how genealogy flows into active worship.<p>- &#8220;So the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD&#8221; (1 Chron 15:15). Uriel stands within that obedient tradition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Uzziah his son</b><p>- Distinct from King Uzziah of Judah (2 Chron 26:1), this Kohathite represents God&#8217;s ongoing provision of servants (1 Chron 9:31&#8211;32).<p>- &#8220;The LORD is my strength and my shield&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>); the succession from Tahath to Uzziah shows that strength renewed in every generation.<p>- His name assures returned exiles that priestly oversight continued exactly as prescribed (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shaul his son</b><p>- Shaul completes this four-name segment before the genealogy branches again in verse 25, underscoring continuity.<p>- &#8220;The sons of Levi did everything the LORD commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42</a>). Shaul&#8217;s inclusion underlines decades of unwavering obedience.<p>- This list prepares for later descendants such as Samuel the prophet (1 Chron 6:33&#8211;38), proving God&#8217;s meticulous providence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-24.htm">1 Chronicles 6:24</a> is more than a simple roll call. By naming Tahath, Uriel, Uzziah, and Shaul in sequence, Scripture displays God&#8217;s faithfulness: every generation of Kohathite Levites was kept, qualified, and ready for temple service. The verse quietly assures readers that when God establishes a covenant, He preserves every servant and fulfills every promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) In the corresponding verse of the genealogy of Heman below (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-38.htm" title="The son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.">1Chronicles 6:38</a>) the names are Tahath, Zephaniah, Azariah, and Joel.
