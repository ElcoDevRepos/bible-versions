The East Gate was significant as it was the main entrance to the temple, symbolizing the direction of the rising sun and often associated with the coming of the Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>). Shelemiah, a descendant of the Korahites, was entrusted with this important position, indicating his family's esteemed role in temple service.<p><b>Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor,</b><br>Zechariah, the son of Shelemiah, is noted for his wisdom, which was a valued trait for those in leadership and advisory roles (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>). His designation as a "wise counselor" suggests he possessed discernment and understanding, qualities essential for maintaining order and justice at the temple gates. This wisdom may also reflect the broader biblical theme of God granting wisdom to those who seek Him, as seen in Solomon's request for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>).<p><b>and the lot for the North Gate fell to him.</b><br>The North Gate, like the East Gate, was a critical point of access to the temple. Its assignment to Zechariah underscores the trust placed in him due to his wisdom. The North Gate's strategic importance is highlighted in various biblical passages, such as <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3-5</a>, where it is associated with visions of idolatry, indicating the need for vigilant and wise gatekeepers. This allocation of duties through casting lots reflects the belief in divine providence guiding the decisions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, which states that the lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shelemiah.htm">Shelemiah</a></b><br>A gatekeeper in the temple, responsible for the East Gate.

It faced the rising sun, reminding worshipers of God&#8217;s light breaking into darkness (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Gatekeepers were Levites charged with holiness, order, and security (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-21.htm">1 Chronicles 9:21&#8211;24</a>). Their watch kept idolatry and impurity from entering the temple precincts (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-19.htm">2 Chronicles 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By lot&#8212;not human preference&#8212;Shelemiah received this honored assignment. <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a> underscores that &#8220;the decision is from the LORD.&#8221; The verse therefore highlights God&#8217;s sovereign placement of servants where He desires.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor</b><p>&#8226; Scripture calls Zechariah &#8220;a wise counselor,&#8221; signaling his discernment and godly insight (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>; 11:14).

Assigning it to Zechariah shows confidence in his capability to guard a vital entrance.<p>&#8226; Historically, invasion threats often approached from the north (<a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13&#8211;15</a>). A &#8220;wise counselor&#8221; stationed here reflects God&#8217;s provision of skilled leadership at potential points of vulnerability.<p>&#8226; Together, the East and North gates remind us that every direction of life belongs under God&#8217;s ordered care (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; God sovereignly assigns His servants; the casting of lots underscored that truth.<p>&#8226; Shelemiah&#8217;s post at the East Gate signified honor and vigilance in worship.<p>&#8226; Zechariah&#8217;s wisdom qualified him for critical leadership, illustrating that spiritual insight matters as much as lineage.<p>&#8226; Father and son serving concurrently display the beauty of generational ministry.<p>&#8226; Whether guarding the bright East or the potentially perilous North, faithful gatekeepers kept God&#8217;s house secure&#8212;an enduring call for believers to stand watch where the Lord stations us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah.</span>--The courses of the sons of Shelemiah (Meshelemiah <a href="/1_chronicles/26-1.htm" title="Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.">1Chronicles 26:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-9.htm" title="And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, strong men, eighteen.">1Chronicles 26:9</a>, and Shallum 9:19) received by lot the post of honour on the east side of the Sanctuary.<p><span class= "bld">Then for Zechariah his son.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">And Zechariah his son, counselling with sagacity, they cast lots.</span> The preposition <span class= "ital">for</span> may have fallen out before <span class= "ital">Zechariah;</span> or perhaps Zechariah is the real subject of the verb "cast lots," which is plural, because Zechariah is the name of a clan or guild.

The chronicler could have had no motive for so characterising a warder of the Temple, unless he had found it in some older source, of which he has only given extracts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> - The casting of lots for the four chief names and the four chief aspects of gates, now proceeds. A special note is made of the care taken for the house of <span class="cmt_word">Asuppim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of "gatherings" or "stores." For all that we know of this "house," we seem to be left to the verses (15, 17) of this passage, and to the expression (<a href="/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>), "the storehouses, or stores of the gates" (though the Authorized Version, the "thresholds" of the gates), which would have been more intelligible had it been reversed, "the gates of the stores." Presumably it was a building for keeping safe certain of the sacred property, and was situated south of the temple, and, judging from ver. 17, had two doorways. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">seniorum concilium. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To Shuppim</span>. Nothing can be made of this word in this connection, as a proper name, though we have it (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12, 15</a>) as such. It is now generally rejected, as probably due to the error of some transcriber, whose eye may have been caught again by the last two syllables of the closely preceding "Asuppim." But some would place it as the last word of the previous verse, and make it amplify the meaning of <span class="accented">Asuppim</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "gatherings for stores." <span class="cmt_word">Shallecheth</span>. By derivation, this word means "sending or throwing down." Hence some call it, "the refuse gate." The situation of it is, however, defined here, as by the <span class="cmt_word">causeway of the going up</span>, and would seem to render such an interpretation less likely. According to Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), this causeway is still traceable: it runs up from the central valley of the town to the sacred site west of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>); and Grove would identify the "gate of Shallecheth" with the present <span class="accented">Bab Silsileh.</span> The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate of the temple-cell, which word they could get from the inverting of the order of the first two letters of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Shallecheth.</span> The Septuagint then mutts the following word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Ward against ward</span>;
