This reference to Jeiel as the "father" suggests he was a prominent figure or leader in the community. Gibeon was known for its strategic location and its inhabitants' cunning treaty with Joshua (Joshua 9). The mention of Jeiel here connects the chronicler's genealogical record to the broader narrative of Israel's history, emphasizing the continuity of God's people.<p><b>lived in Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a major city in ancient Israel, located northwest of Jerusalem. It played a crucial role in several biblical events, including the miraculous halting of the sun in <a href="/joshua/10.htm">Joshua 10</a>. Archaeological findings at the site of modern-day el-Jib have confirmed its historical significance. The chronicler's mention of Jeiel living in Gibeon underscores the city's importance and the enduring legacy of its inhabitants within the tribe of Benjamin.<p><b>His wife&#8217;s name was Maacah</b><br>The name Maacah appears multiple times in the Old Testament, often associated with women of influence or royal connections. This particular Maacah, as the wife of Jeiel, would have been part of the genealogical heritage of Gibeon. The inclusion of her name highlights the chronicler's attention to familial details, which was important for establishing lineage and inheritance rights in Israelite society. The mention of women in genealogies, though less common, indicates their valued role in the continuity of the family line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeiel.htm">Jeiel</a></b><br>Identified as the father of Gibeon, Jeiel is a patriarchal figure whose lineage is significant in the genealogical records of Israel.

His prominence anticipates the rise of Saul&#8217;s family (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39-40</a>), reminding readers that God works through families and historical lines, not random chance.<p>&#8226; The simple naming emphasizes literal history rather than myth; these are real people in a real time and place (<a href="/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The father of Gibeon</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Father&#8221; often denotes founder or leading ancestor. Jeiel likely established or strengthened the settlement at Gibeon (<a href="/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>; 18:25).<p>&#8226; This title underscores stewardship: God assigns places and responsibilities to His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Gibeon itself becomes significant&#8212;a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>) and later a major worship site where Solomon asked for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4-5</a>). Jeiel&#8217;s role therefore connects the Benjamite clan to both priestly service and royal history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lived in Gibeon</b><p>&#8226; The text stresses residence: Jeiel actually &#8220;lived in Gibeon.&#8221; After the exile, returning families needed assurance that ancestral allotments remained theirs (<a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6-7</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-20.htm">Ezra 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical dwelling fulfils the land promise first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>).

Their appearances point to God&#8217;s habit of weaving women into redemptive history (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording both husband and wife, the chronicler showcases God&#8217;s design for family partnerships in carrying forward faith and heritage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a> is more than a genealogical footnote. Jeiel&#8217;s identity, his founding role in Gibeon, his settled life in the promised land, and the mention of his wife Maacah together proclaim God&#8217;s faithfulness to families, land, and covenant.
