This name implies a place where chariots were either manufactured, stored, or maintained, indicating its strategic importance. The mention of chariots connects to the broader biblical narrative where chariots were a symbol of military power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a> with Pharaoh's chariots. The presence of such a site in the tribal allotments of Simeon reflects the tribe's role in Israel's defense and territorial expansion.<p><b>Hazar-susim</b><br>Hazar-susim translates to "village of horses," indicating a settlement known for horse breeding or stabling. Horses were crucial for chariots and cavalry, underscoring the military theme in this passage. This location's name highlights the economic and strategic value of horse breeding in ancient Israel, aligning with Solomon's later accumulation of horses and chariots (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). The emphasis on horses and chariots in these cities suggests a focus on military readiness and infrastructure.<p><b>Beth-biri</b><br>Beth-biri, meaning "house of my creation" or "house of my well," is less clear in its specific function or significance. However, the name suggests a place of personal or divine significance, possibly indicating a site of worship or a well-known landmark. The ambiguity of its name invites reflection on the personal and communal aspects of settlement life in ancient Israel, where names often carried spiritual or historical meanings.<p><b>Shaaraim</b><br>Shaaraim, meaning "two gates," suggests a fortified city with significant defensive structures. The dual gates imply a city of considerable size and importance, possibly serving as a regional administrative or military center. The name evokes the imagery of protection and security, themes prevalent throughout the Old Testament, such as in Nehemiah's rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and gates (Nehemiah 3). Shaaraim's mention here underscores the importance of fortified cities in maintaining tribal territories and security.<p><b>These were their cities until the reign of David.</b><br>This phrase indicates a transition in territorial control or significance during David's reign. David's consolidation of power and establishment of Jerusalem as the capital marked a shift in Israel's political and military landscape. The mention of these cities until David's reign suggests changes in administrative boundaries or military strategies, reflecting David's centralization efforts and the unification of the tribes. This transition period is crucial in understanding the development of the Israelite monarchy and the fulfillment of God's promises to David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-marcaboth.htm">Beth-marcaboth</a></b><br>A town mentioned in the territory of the tribe of Simeon.

That fits the surrounding context of <a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6&#8211;10</a>, where David and his men moved freely through this region.<p>&#8226; By citing the town again generations later, the Chronicler highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness: what He assigns, He preserves, even in an arid land (<a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hazar-susim</b><p>&#8226; Also listed with Simeon in <a href="/joshua/19-6.htm">Joshua 19:6</a>, this &#8220;enclosure&#8221; town probably supported flocks and herds, connecting with the shepherd image woven through Scripture (<a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>; <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Its mention reminds us that the tribe of Simeon relied on pastoral life in territory technically inside Judah&#8217;s borders, demonstrating inter-tribal cooperation long before the united monarchy (<a href="/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-38.htm">1 Chronicles 4:38-41</a> later shows Simeonite leaders pushing southward for more grazing land, a continuation of the story anchored in places like Hazar-susim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Beth-biri</b><p>&#8226; Named again only in <a href="/joshua/19-6.htm">Joshua 19:6</a>, this town lies in the same cluster. The Chronicler&#8217;s repetition affirms the literal continuity of these communities from Joshua to David&#8212;roughly four centuries (<a href="/acts/13-20.htm">Acts 13:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Such continuity matters: it proves that Israel&#8217;s census lists (<a href="/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>) translated into real villages where families lived, worshiped, and raised children, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>.<p>&#8226; The stable existence of Beth-biri until David&#8217;s reign mirrors God&#8217;s promise to plant His people securely (<a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shaaraim</b><p>&#8226; Mentioned earlier in the account of David and Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52</a>), Shaaraim marks the western edge of the Shephelah. Its reappearance links the Simeonite register to David&#8217;s rise.<p>&#8226; Because David&#8217;s early victories radiated from this vicinity, the Chronicler subtly shows how God was preparing the nation&#8217;s future king while preserving Simeon&#8217;s settlements (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-71</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;These were their cities until the reign of David&#8221; signals a historical pivot: when David assumed power, administrative boundaries shifted (<a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5-9</a>), and Simeon&#8217;s identity blended more fully into Judah (<a href="/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/4-31.htm">1 Chronicles 4:31</a> is more than a catalog of obscure towns; it is a testimony that God faithfully sustained Simeon&#8217;s inheritance from Joshua&#8217;s conquest right up to David&#8217;s throne. Each place&#8212;Beth-marcaboth in the desert, Hazar-susim among the flocks, Beth-biri in family life, and Shaaraim on the military frontier&#8212;shows a facet of God&#8217;s provision. By recording that they endured &#8220;until the reign of David,&#8221; Scripture marks the moment when the Lord transitioned Israel from tribal loose-knit living to united monarchy, all without losing track of a single village He had promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Beth-marcaboth</span> = "house of chariots."<p><span class= "bld">Hazar - susim</span> = "village of horses;" for which Hazarsusah is an equivalent (<span class= "ital">susah</span> being used as a collective word).<p><span class= "bld">Beth-birei.</span>--Probably a corrupt writing of Beth-lebaoth, "house of lionesses" (<a href="/joshua/19-6.htm" title="And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:">Joshua 19:6</a>), for which <a href="/joshua/15-32.htm" title="And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:">Joshua 15:32</a> has the contraction Lebaoth.
