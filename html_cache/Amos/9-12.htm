Historically, Edom was a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel. The "remnant of Edom" suggests a surviving group after judgment, indicating a future where Israel will have dominion over its former adversaries. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the Davidic promise, where Israel's borders would extend to include surrounding nations. Theologically, it symbolizes the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant people, as Edom is often seen as representative of the nations opposed to Israel.<p><b>and all the nations that bear My name,&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse expands the promise beyond Edom to include all nations that acknowledge the sovereignty of God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a name signified ownership and identity. Thus, nations bearing God's name implies those who recognize His authority and worship Him. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of the Gospel reaching the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16-17</a>, where James quotes this passage to support the inclusion of Gentiles in the early church. It highlights the universal scope of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine authority and certainty of the prophecy. In the biblical context, when the LORD declares something, it is an assurance of its fulfillment. It underscores the sovereignty of God in orchestrating history according to His purposes. The use of "declares" is a common prophetic formula, affirming that the message is not from the prophet's own imagination but from God Himself.<p><b>who will do this.</b><br>This final phrase assures the reader of God's active role in bringing about the prophecy. It is a statement of divine initiative and power, reinforcing that the fulfillment of these promises does not depend on human effort but on God's faithfulness. This assurance is consistent with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to accomplish His will, as seen throughout Scripture, including the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who unites Jews and Gentiles into one body.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the northern kingdom of Israel during a time of prosperity and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.
