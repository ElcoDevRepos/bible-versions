Visions were a common way God communicated with His prophets, providing them with divine insight and messages for His people. Amos, a shepherd and fig tree farmer from Tekoa, was called by God to prophesy to the Northern Kingdom of Israel during a time of prosperity and moral decline. This vision is one of several in the book of Amos, each revealing God's judgment and expectations.<p><b>Behold, the Lord was standing by a wall true to plumb:</b><br>The imagery of a wall "true to plumb" suggests a structure built with precision and integrity. In ancient construction, a plumb line was used to ensure that walls were perfectly vertical, symbolizing righteousness and justice. The wall represents Israel, initially built according to God's standards. The presence of the Lord by the wall indicates His authority and the impending evaluation of Israel's faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>with a plumb line in His hand:</b><br>The plumb line symbolizes God's standard of righteousness and justice. It is a tool for measurement, indicating that God is assessing Israel's moral and spiritual alignment with His laws. This imagery underscores the idea that God is not arbitrary in His judgments; He measures His people against His divine standards. The plumb line also foreshadows the coming judgment, as Israel is found to be out of alignment with God's expectations. This concept of divine measurement is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>, where justice and righteousness are described as the measuring line and plumb line. The plumb line can also be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies the perfect standard of righteousness and through whom believers are measured.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is revealing His judgment and standards to the prophet Amos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and repentance to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall.htm">The Wall</a></b><br>Symbolizes the nation of Israel, built according to God's standards but now subject to His judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plumb_line.htm">The Plumb Line</a></b><br>A tool used to ensure structures are vertically true, symbolizing God's standard of righteousness and justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which is being measured against God's standards and found wanting.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_standard_of_righteousness.htm">God's Standard of Righteousness</a></b><br>The plumb line represents God's unchanging standard of righteousness.
