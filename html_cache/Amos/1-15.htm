In the context of Amos, this prophecy is directed towards the Ammonites, a neighboring nation of Israel. Historically, the Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel, and their king's exile signifies a complete overthrow of their political structure. The exile of a king was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern warfare, symbolizing the total defeat and humiliation of a nation. This prophecy aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to raise and depose leaders according to His will, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>.<p><b>he and his princes together,</b><br>The mention of "princes" alongside the king emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the judgment. It is not only the king who will face exile but also the ruling class, indicating a total dismantling of the existing power structure. This reflects the biblical principle that leadership is accountable to God and that the sins of a nation often reflect the failures of its leaders. The collective exile of the king and his princes suggests a complete removal of the current regime, similar to the fate of other nations judged by God, such as Babylon in <a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47:1-5</a>.<p><b>says the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is not merely a prediction but a declaration from the LORD, the covenant name of God, indicating His personal involvement and assurance that the prophecy will be fulfilled. The use of "says the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that authenticates the message as divinely inspired. It serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over history and His ability to execute judgment according to His righteous standards, as seen throughout the prophetic books of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver

They had &#8220;ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead,&#8221; a brutal campaign against Israel&#8217;s defenseless. The Lord announces a three-fold judgment:<p>&#8226; Fire on Rabbah, Ammon&#8217;s capital, consuming &#8220;its citadels&#8221; (<a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; A loud battle cry that turns the royal palace into a furnace of panic (<a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Finally, &#8220;Their king will go into exile&#8212;he and his princes together,&#8221; says the LORD (<a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>). This verse is the climactic statement that seals Ammon&#8217;s fate, echoing God&#8217;s earlier dealings with violent oppressors (<a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/3-1.htm">Joel 3:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their king</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Their king&#8221; is most naturally the reigning monarch of Ammon; tradition holds it was Baal-hanan or Milcom/Malcam.<p>&#8226; The wording also hints at Ammon&#8217;s god Milcom, worshiped as a ruling deity (<a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>). Whether earthly or idolatrous, any power that sets itself against the Lord will be dethroned (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying the king, God targets the nation&#8217;s highest symbol of security. Earthly thrones crumble when confronted by the King of kings (<a href="/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will go into exile</b><p>&#8226; Exile is forced relocation, a punishment God had already used on Israel and Judah (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; 25:21).<p>&#8226; Ammon&#8217;s turn would come through invading empires&#8212;fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar overran the region (<a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Exile strips a nation of land, heritage, and autonomy, fulfilling <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>: &#8220;I will curse those who curse you.&#8221; Ammon&#8217;s cruelty boomerangs back on them (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He and his princes together</b><p>&#8226; No royal escape clause exists; leaders and cabinet alike face the same judgment (<a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Shared exile shows collective responsibility.

E.V. is supported by LXX., Targ., and context of the passage. So far we find the prophet denouncing the sin which trifles with blood, covenants, and ancient agreements, and recognising the responsibilities of race; but closer inspection shows in this, and in Amos 2, that the prophet condemns all violations of those natural laws and rights of which he regards Jehovah as custodian and executor.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. So Keil, Trochon, and others consider that the King of the Ammonites is meant. The Vulgate, with Aquila, Symmachus, the Syriac, and Jerome, retrains the word Melchous, or Melcham, which is the same as Molech, their god. This interpretation is favoured by passages in Jeremiah, of which one is evidently quoted from Amos, "For Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together" (<a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>); and the other (<a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>) is similar, with the substitution of "Chemosh," the god of Moab, for "Maleam." That the localized deity should share the fortunes of his worshippers is quite in accordance with the ideas of the time (comp. <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>). Probably Amos meant to include both notions - their "Malcam," whether king or god. should be carried into captivity, accompanied by the princes, all the chiefs, military and sacerdotal, so that no one should he left to head a future revolt. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;la&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into exile&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(bag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">Exile, exiles</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his princes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1435;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">together,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7717;&#183;d&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3162.htm">Strong's 3162: </a> </span><span class="str2">A unit, unitedly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/amos/1-15.htm">OT Prophets: Amos 1:15 And their king will go into captivity (Amo.
