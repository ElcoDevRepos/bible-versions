Amos, a shepherd from Tekoa, was called by God to deliver His words to Israel. This emphasizes the divine authority behind the message, as Amos speaks not on his own behalf but as a mouthpiece for the LORD.<p><b>The LORD roars from Zion</b><br>The imagery of the LORD roaring like a lion signifies power, authority, and impending judgment. Zion, a hill in Jerusalem, represents the spiritual center of Israel, where God&#8217;s presence dwells. This roar indicates that God is about to act decisively, and it echoes the lion imagery found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a> and <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>, where God&#8217;s voice is associated with both judgment and protection.<p><b>and raises His voice from Jerusalem;</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and religious capital of Israel, is the location from which God&#8217;s voice emanates. This highlights the city&#8217;s significance as the place where God&#8217;s covenant with His people is centered. The raising of His voice suggests an urgent and authoritative proclamation, underscoring the seriousness of the message.<p><b>the pastures of the shepherds mourn,</b><br>The mourning of the pastures symbolizes the devastation and desolation that will come as a result of God&#8217;s judgment. Shepherds, who rely on fertile pastures for their livelihood, will face hardship. This imagery connects to the agricultural society of ancient Israel, where the health of the land directly impacted the people&#8217;s well-being. It also reflects the broader theme of creation suffering due to human sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>.<p><b>and the summit of Carmel withers.</b><br>Mount Carmel, known for its lush vegetation and beauty, represents prosperity and fertility. Its withering signifies the extent of the coming judgment, affecting even the most fertile and vibrant areas. This serves as a warning of the totality of God&#8217;s judgment, reminiscent of the drought and famine themes found in other prophetic writings, such as Elijah&#8217;s confrontation with the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.

As in <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>, prophets &#8220;spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,&#8221; underscoring the reliability and authority of the message (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD roars from Zion</b><p>- The verb &#8220;roars&#8221; pictures the Lord like a lion asserting dominion. This is not a whisper but a thunderous declaration of judgment (compare <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a> and <a href="/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>).<p>- &#8220;Zion&#8221; refers to the hill in Jerusalem where the temple stood.

The "pastures of the Shepherds" remind us of Psalms 23, and refers us to the prophet's own home in the wilderness of Tekoah. The same expression "head (or 'top') of Carmel" occurs in <a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm" title="So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,">1Kings 18:42</a>, and in <a href="/amos/9-3.htm" title="And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:">Amos 9:3</a>.

The following clause is a repetition of <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; and Amos thus connects his prophecy with that of his predscessor, to show the unity of prophetic mission, and to warn the Jews that God's punishments are not directed exclusively on heathen nations. To the nations denounced by Joel, Amos adds others of Israel's enemies, viz. Syria, Ammon, and Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Roar... voice.</span> The thunder is the voice of God announcing his coming to judge. <span class="cmt_word">From Zion.</span> Not from Dan and Bethel, the seats of idolatrous worship, but from Jerusalem, the abode of his presence. <span class="cmt_word">The habitations;</span> better, <span class="accented">the pastures.</span> It is only natural that Amos, the shepherd, should use such terms to express the idea that the whole land, from Jerusalem on the south to Carmel on the north, should feel the vengeance of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Shall mourn;</span> explained by the following term, <span class="cmt_word">shall wither;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall lose their verdure (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The top of Carmel.</span> This is the Mount Carmel, which stretches boldly into the sea on the south of the Bay of Acre, and is remarkable for its extreme fertility, its rich pastures, its vines, olives, fruits, and flowers. Thomson, 'The Land and the Book;' writes thus about it: "The celebrated ridge, called in the Bible Merest Carmel, and by the Arabs Jebel Kurmul, or Mar Elyas, in honour of Elijah, is an extension of the hills of Samaria, in a northwesterly direction, for a distance of about eighteen miles, terminating in the bold promontory of Carmel, which descends almost literally into the sea. It is steep and lofty where it overhangs the Mediterranean above Haifa, and on that face which overlooks the Plain of Acre on the north, and that of Esdraelon towards the southeast. There is no special excellency in Carmel at the present day, whatever may be said of Sharon. Its name, Kurmul, or Kerm-el, signifies 'the vineyard of God;' but its vineyards have all disappeared. It was a glorious mountain, however, and a prominent landmark; according to Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>), Carmel was a resort of herdsmen. Amos says, 'The habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither,' in the time of the threatened judgment, and this implies that its pastures were not ordinarily liable to wither. This may, in part, have been occasioned by the heavy dews which its lofty elevation, so near the sea, causes to distil nightly upon its thirsty head. I found it quite green and flowery in midsummer. It was a noble pasture field, and, in reference to that characteristic, Micah utters his sweet prayer, 'Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He said:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1427;&#1512;
