Visions were a common way God communicated with His prophets, providing them with divine insight into His plans and purposes. Amos, a shepherd and fig tree farmer from Tekoa, was called by God to prophesy to the Northern Kingdom of Israel. This vision underscores the authority and divine origin of the message Amos is about to deliver.<p><b>He was preparing swarms of locusts:</b><br>Locusts are often used in the Bible as instruments of divine judgment. In the ancient Near East, locust plagues were feared for their ability to devastate crops and cause famine. The preparation of locusts signifies an impending judgment from God due to Israel's persistent sin and rebellion. This imagery is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>) and serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>just after the king&#8217;s harvest:</b><br>The timing of the locust swarm is significant. The "king's harvest" likely refers to the first cutting of crops, which was often reserved for the king as a form of tax or tribute. This indicates that the locusts would come after the initial harvest, targeting the remaining crops that the people depended on for sustenance. This highlights the severity of the judgment, as it would lead to economic hardship and food scarcity.<p><b>as the late spring crop was coming up:</b><br>The late spring crop, or the "second growth," was crucial for the survival of the people, as it provided food for the coming months. The destruction of this crop by locusts would have dire consequences, leading to famine and suffering. This timing emphasizes the thoroughness of God's judgment, leaving no room for recovery or hope apart from repentance. The imagery of locusts consuming the late crop also connects to <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, where a similar judgment is described, reinforcing the theme of divine retribution for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and divine authority who reveals the vision to Amos.

Their destructive power is real, not symbolic, and would be instantly understood by Amos&#8217;s audience.<p>&#8226; By revealing the threat before it strikes, God is giving opportunity for repentance, paralleling <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7&#8211;8</a> where announced judgment can still be averted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just after the king&#8217;s harvest</b><p>&#8226; In Israel, the first cutting of hay or grain often went to the royal storehouses as tax (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>). Once the king&#8217;s portion was secured, ordinary farmers depended on the remaining growth for survival.<p>&#8226; A locust plague timed &#8220;after the king&#8217;s harvest&#8221; means common people would face the brunt of the loss, highlighting God&#8217;s concern for social justice (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail confirms the literal timing and severity of the judgment, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38&#8211;42</a>, where covenant curses strike at agricultural cycles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the late spring crop was coming up</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;late spring&#8221; (second) crop is the final hope for food before summer; destroying it would ensure famine (<a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture intensifies the warning: God can touch the nation at its most vulnerable moment (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it reminds us that worldly security can vanish quickly when the LORD&#8217;s hand moves (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a> records a literal vision in which God readies a locust plague timed to devastate Israel&#8217;s food supply right after the royal harvest, leaving the populace exposed. The scene underscores God&#8217;s sovereign control over creation, His righteous judgment on national sin, and His merciful willingness to warn before acting.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) Each of the visions is introduced with closely resembling words. For "grasshopper," read <span class= "ital">locusts.</span> The phrase "king's mowings" suggests that the king claimed tyrannically the first-fruits of the hay harvest, which was ordinarily followed by the early "rain upon the mown grass." (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm" title="And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.">1Kings 18:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 9:10.</span> - Part III. FIVE VISIONS, WITH EXPLANATIONS, CONTINUING AND CONFIRMING THE PREVIOUS PROPHECY. The afflictions are climactic, increasing in intensity. The first two symbolize judgments which have been averted by the prophet's intercession; the third and fourth adumbrate judgments which are to fall inevitably; and the fifth proclaims the overthrow of the temple and the old theocracy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">The first vision, of locusts, represents Israel as a field eaten down to the ground, but shooting up afresh, and its utter destruction postponed at the prophet's prayer.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me.</span> By an inward illumination (comp. vers. 4, 7; and <a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He formed grasshoppers;</span> rather, <span class="accented">locusts</span> (<a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>). This points to the moral government of God, who uses nature to work his purposes, "wind and storm fulfilling his word." <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;</span> when the aftermath was beginning to grow under the influence of the latter rains. If the herbage was destroyed then, there would be no hope of recovery in the rest of the year. <span class="cmt_word">After the king's mowings.</span> It is deduced from this expression that the first crop on certain grounds was taken for the king's use - a kind of royal perquisite, though there is no trace of such a custom found in Scripture, the passage in <a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>, where Ahab sends Obadiah to search for pasture, having plainly nothing to do with it; and in this case, as Keil remarks, the plague would seem to fall upon the people only, and the guilty king would have escaped. But to interpret the expression entirely in a spiritual sense, with no substantial basis, as "Jehovah's judgments," destroys the harmony of the vision, ignoring its material aspect altogether. It is quite possible that the custom above mentioned did exist, though it was probably limited to certain lands, and did not apply to the whole pasturage of the country. It is here mentioned to define the time of the plague of locusts - the time, in fact, when its ravages would be most irremediable. The LXX., by a little change of letters, render, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, by which they imply that the locusts would be as innumerable as the army of Gog. The whole version is, "Behold, a swarm of locusts coming from the East; and behold, one caterpillar, King Gog." The vision is thought to refer to the first invasion by the Assyrians, when Pul was bribed by Menahem to withdraw. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">showed me:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1433;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;&#8217;a&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
