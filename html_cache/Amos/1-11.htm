It underscores the authority and seriousness of the pronouncement. In the prophetic tradition, this formula is used to convey that the prophet is merely a messenger of God's words.<p><b>For three transgressions of Edom, even four, I will not revoke My judgment:</b><br>The formula "for three transgressions, even four" is a Hebrew idiom indicating a fullness or completeness of sin, suggesting that Edom's sins are numerous and have reached a tipping point. Edom, descendants of Esau, had a long-standing enmity with Israel, descendants of Jacob. This phrase indicates that Edom's repeated offenses have led to inevitable divine judgment.<p><b>because he pursued his brother with the sword:</b><br>Edom's hostility towards Israel is highlighted here, with "brother" referring to the kinship between Esau (Edom) and Jacob (Israel). The use of the sword symbolizes violent aggression. Historically, Edom often allied with Israel's enemies, exacerbating the conflict between the two nations.<p><b>and stifled all compassion;</b><br>This phrase points to Edom's lack of mercy and empathy, violating the expected familial bonds. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kinship ties were sacred, and Edom's actions are portrayed as a betrayal of these ties.<p><b>his anger raged continually,</b><br>Edom's persistent anger is emphasized, suggesting a deep-seated, ongoing hostility. This relentless anger is seen as unjustified and excessive, contributing to their guilt.<p><b>and his fury flamed incessantly:</b><br>The imagery of unending fury conveys the intensity and destructiveness of Edom's actions. This perpetual wrath is condemned as it leads to ongoing violence and conflict. The language here reflects the broader biblical theme of the dangers of unchecked anger and vengeance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob (Israel).

The prophet proceeds to denounce the three nations cognate to Israel, of which the Edomites were the nearest and the most inimical. From the time of Esau until now they had been consistent in enmity, and it is this unbrotherly conduct rather than any specific outrages which Amos here condemns. Edom is accused of relentless persecution, inhumanity, savage fury, and persistent anger.
