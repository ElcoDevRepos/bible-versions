Elders and judges would sit at the gate to resolve disputes and administer justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>, <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>). The one who "reproves" is likely a figure of authority or a prophet who calls out injustice and wrongdoing. This phrase highlights the resistance and hostility faced by those who uphold righteousness and truth, a theme echoed throughout the prophetic books. The hatred towards such figures reflects a broader societal rejection of God's standards, as seen in the persecution of prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>) and the ultimate rejection of Jesus Christ, who was despised for His message of repentance (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>).<p><b>and despise him who speaks with integrity</b><br>Integrity, or moral uprightness, is a key biblical virtue (<a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>). The disdain for those who speak with integrity indicates a society that has turned away from God's commandments, valuing deceit and corruption over truth. This mirrors the broader narrative of Israel's spiritual decline, where truth-tellers are marginalized. The rejection of integrity is not only a personal failing but a communal one, leading to societal decay. This theme is consistent with the warnings of other prophets, such as Isaiah, who lamented the lack of justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus embodies perfect integrity, and His followers are called to emulate this trait, even in the face of opposition (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and repentance to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which had fallen into idolatry and social injustice, prompting God's warnings through Amos.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gate.htm">The Gate</a></b><br>In ancient Israelite cities, the gate was a place of legal proceedings and public discourse, where elders and judges would sit to make decisions and offer counsel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reprover.htm">The Reprover</a></b><br>A person who offers correction or criticism, often a prophet or a wise elder, who speaks truth and calls for justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/integrity.htm">Integrity</a></b><br>The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles, which was lacking among the leaders and people of Israel at the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_truth-telling.htm">The Cost of Truth-Telling</a></b><br>Speaking truth and standing for righteousness often leads to rejection and hostility.

Throughout the chapter the prophet has been calling the nation back to the LORD, yet pockets of resistance remain (<a href="/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6, 8</a>). Their existence is not hypothetical&#8212;it is real and present. Similar acknowledgement of a rebellious remnant appears in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2&#8211;4</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23&#8211;24</a>, where the prophets note that many hear God&#8217;s warnings yet refuse to repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who hate the one who reproves</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Hate&#8221; is deliberate hostility, not mere discomfort.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The one who reproves&#8221; refers to those God appoints to confront sin. In Israel this included prophets like Amos and righteous elders who rendered judgment (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a> states, &#8220;A mocker does not love the one who reproves him.&#8221; This hate reveals hearts hardened against accountability.<p>&#8226; Jesus later confirms that darkness resents light because it exposes evil deeds (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the gate</b><p>&#8226; The city gate was the public court, marketplace, and center of civic life (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Justice was meant to be transparent there. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a> commands judges to administer righteous judgment &#8220;in all your gates.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By hating reprovers at the gate, Israel rejected godly correction at the very place designed for it, echoing the corrupt courts condemned in <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a> and <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And despise him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Despise&#8221; intensifies the thought: it is contempt that leads to dismissal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/50-17.htm">Psalm 50:17</a> portrays the wicked as those who &#8220;hate My instruction and cast My words behind you,&#8221; underscoring that rejection of God&#8217;s messengers is ultimately rejection of God Himself (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who speaks with integrity</b><p>&#8226; Integrity (lit. &#8220;uprightness&#8221;) marks the faithful messenger. <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a> describes the righteous as one &#8220;who walks with integrity, who practices righteousness, and who speaks the truth in his heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet truth-telling provokes resistance when it exposes sin. Paul experiences the same dynamic in <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>: &#8220;Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s consistent pattern is to send truth through upright voices; human nature, apart from grace, resists and persecutes them (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29&#8211;35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a> exposes a heart issue: when people harden themselves against God, they grow to hate public correction and despise those who faithfully speak truth. The city gate&#8212;designed for justice&#8212;had become hostile territory for righteousness, signaling deep societal decay. The verse warns that rejecting godly reproof is rejecting God Himself and invites us instead to welcome correction, love truth, and uphold integrity wherever judgment is rendered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Rebuker in the Gate.--</span>The person so described might be the prophet himself.

The gate of Eastern cities was the place of public resort (<a href="/proverbs/1-21.htm">Proverbs 1:21</a>), either for business (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>), or the administration of justice (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>), or for gossip.

It seems better to take the words thus than to join "in the gate" to "they hate," with the meaning that those who resort to the gate - kings, chiefs, judges - hate the prophet's reproof, for the following verses show that Amos is referring chiefly to judicial proceedings, and not to his own mission. <span class="cmt_word">Uprightly</span>; literally, <span class="accented">perfectly</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">perfecte</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without reserve, keeping nothing back. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you hate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8130.htm">Strong's 8130: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the one who reproves</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3198.htm">Strong's 3198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be right, reciprocal, to argue, to decide, justify, convict</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the gate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#353;&#183;&#353;a&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8179.htm">Strong's 8179: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, gate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and despise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1469;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8581.htm">Strong's 8581: </a> </span><span class="str2">To loathe, detest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him who speaks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with integrity.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8549.htm">Strong's 8549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Entire, integrity, truth</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/amos/5-10.htm">OT Prophets: Amos 5:10 They hate him who reproves (Amo.
