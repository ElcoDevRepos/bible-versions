The "gates" symbolize the city's defenses and strength. Historically, Damascus was a significant city in the ancient Near East, known for its wealth and power. The breaking down of its gates indicates a complete overthrow and defeat. This prophecy was fulfilled when the Assyrians, under Tiglath-Pileser III, conquered Damascus in 732 BC. The imagery of breaking gates is also used in other prophetic texts to denote divine judgment and the fall of a city (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>).<p><b>I will cut off the ruler from the Valley of Aven</b><br>The "Valley of Aven" is often identified with the region of Baalbek in Lebanon, known for its idolatrous worship. The term "Aven" means "wickedness" or "vanity," suggesting a place of idolatry and false worship. Cutting off the ruler implies the removal of leadership and authority, a common theme in prophetic literature where God judges nations by removing their leaders (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3:1-4</a>). This reflects God's sovereignty over nations and His intolerance of idolatry.<p><b>and the one who wields the scepter in Beth-eden.</b><br>Beth-eden, meaning "house of pleasure" or "house of delight," is thought to be a region associated with luxury and ease, possibly located in the vicinity of modern-day Syria. The "scepter" is a symbol of royal authority and governance. By cutting off the one who wields it, God is declaring the end of the ruling power in this region. This act of judgment underscores the theme of divine retribution against those who oppose God's will and engage in idolatry and injustice.<p><b>The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,&#8221;</b><br>The exile to Kir fulfills the prophecy of judgment against Aram. Kir is believed to be a region in Mesopotamia, possibly the original homeland of the Arameans (<a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>). This forced relocation signifies the complete subjugation and displacement of the Aramean people, a common practice by conquering empires like Assyria to prevent rebellion. The exile theme is prevalent in the Old Testament, serving as a consequence for disobedience and a tool for divine correction (e.g., the Babylonian exile of Judah).<p><b>says the LORD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind the prophecy. The use of "says the LORD" affirms that the message is not from the prophet's own imagination but is a direct revelation from God. It underscores the certainty and inevitability of the prophecy's fulfillment. Throughout the Bible, the phrase "says the LORD" is used to authenticate the divine origin of a message, reminding the audience of God's ultimate control over history and His faithfulness to His word (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The capital city of Aram (modern-day Syria), known for its wealth and strategic location.

The picture is of every level of leadership&#8212;political and cultural&#8212;being dismantled (<a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God targets the centers where comfort and culture masked injustice, reminding His people that He sees behind every facade (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The Assyrian annals record deportations from these regions, showing God&#8217;s word accomplished in detail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir</b><p>&#8226; Exile was the ultimate covenant curse for violence and idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). By sending Aram back to &#8220;Kir&#8221; (likely their ancestral homeland; cf. <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>), God reverses their history&#8212;undoing their rise and scattering them among foreign nations (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This relocation stripped Aram of national identity, illustrating that human cruelty invites divine uprooting (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly records Assyria&#8217;s mass deportations as the direct fulfillment (<a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>says the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The prophecy closes by stamping God&#8217;s own covenant name on every detail, a reminder that His word is final (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Lord speaks, the events move from possibility to certainty&#8212;encouraging believers that He both judges evil and preserves the integrity of His promises (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a> foretells a four-fold judgment on Damascus: its defenses shattered, its rulers eliminated, its cultural centers stripped of power, and its population sent into exile. History confirms each point, underscoring that the Lord&#8217;s warnings are literal and sure. For God&#8217;s people, the verse is a sober call to trust His justice, reject cruelty, and remember that no fortress, leader, or culture can shield unrepentant sin from His sovereign hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">I will break</span> . . .--The "bar<span class= "ital">"</span> means the bolt of iron or brass with which the city was defended.

The LXX. Renders "On" in <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a> by "Heliopolis;" and On and Baal being both titles of the sun, and indeed synonymous, the introduction of "On" into this passage may be accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">Him that holdeth the sceptre.</span> The king and princes, as ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">From the house of Eden;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-Eden</span>, "House of delight;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">de domo voluptatis</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "out of the men of Charran." This last rendering arises from considering that the reference was to the Eden of <a href="/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>, which the translators placed in the region of Haran. The place in the text Keil supposes to be the Paradisus of the Greeks, which Ptolemy (5:15, 20) locates southeast of Laodicea. Schrader suggests a place on the banks of the middle Euphrates between Balis and Biredschich called <span class="accented">Bit</span>-<span class="accented">Adini</span> in inscriptions of Asurnasirhabal and Salmanassur II. But this seems to be a wrong locality (see 'Die Keilinschriften,' p. 327). The passage means that all the inhabitants of valley and city, king and peasant, shall be cut off. Shall go into captivity. The word implies that the land shall be "stripped" or "bared" of its inhabitants. Wholesale deportation had not hitherto been common in these regions. Kir has been identified with the country on the banks of the river Kar, which flows into the Araxes on the southwest of the Caspian Sea. It forms part of the territory known as Transcaucasia. From this region the Syrians originally emigrated (<a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>), and back to this land a large body were carried when Tiglath-Pileser, some fifty years later, killed Rezin and sacked Damascus, as related in <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> This is the solemn confirmation of the prophet's announcement, and recurs in vers. 8, 15 and <a href="/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will break down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7687;ar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
