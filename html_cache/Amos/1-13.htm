It underscores the authority and seriousness of the pronouncement. In the prophetic books, this formula is often used to convey that the prophet is speaking on behalf of God, not from personal opinion.<p><b>For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four,</b><br>This expression is a Hebrew idiom indicating a fullness or completeness of sin, suggesting that the Ammonites' sins have reached a tipping point. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>) and often in conflict with Israel. The use of "three... even four" is a poetic way to emphasize the gravity and accumulation of their offenses.<p><b>I will not revoke My judgment,</b><br>God's decision is final and irrevocable, highlighting His justice and the certainty of the coming punishment. This reflects the biblical principle that God is patient but will ultimately hold nations accountable for their sins. It also aligns with the theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic literature.<p><b>because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead</b><br>This horrific act of violence against the most vulnerable illustrates the extreme cruelty of the Ammonites. Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, often contested by neighboring nations. Such brutality was not only a war crime but also an affront to the sanctity of life, which is a core biblical value (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>).<p><b>in order to enlarge their territory.</b><br>The motivation behind the atrocity was territorial expansion, reflecting the Ammonites' greed and disregard for human life. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where nations often sought to expand their borders at the expense of others, contrary to God's desire for justice and peace among peoples. The desire for land and power often led to conflict, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who speaks through the prophet Amos, declaring judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, sent by God to deliver messages of judgment to various nations, including Israel and its neighbors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ammonites.htm">The Ammonites</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, located east of the Jordan River, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm, and often a site of conflict between Israel and neighboring nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_atrocity.htm">The Atrocity</a></b><br>The Ammonites committed a heinous act of violence against the pregnant women of Gilead, highlighting their cruelty and desire for territorial expansion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>God takes sin seriously, especially acts of violence and cruelty.

The Ammonites seem to have been a predatory and roving nation, though the abundance of rains in the district shows that they possessed fixed abodes; but Rabbah was the only city of importance in their territory (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>). Their hostility to Israel was first shown in their participation with Moab in the affair of Balsam (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>). Other instances are seen in their treatment of Jabesh-Gilead (<a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-3</a>) and of David's messengers, and in hiring the Syrians to make war on David (<a href="/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-6</a>). We have no historical account of the atrocious outrage on the Gileadites mentioned in the text, but it is quite in character with the ferocity of their disposition, and was doubtless intended to depopulate the territory which they wished to acquire. This barbarity is spoken of in connection with Hazael (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>), in concert with whom probably the Ammonites acted (comp. <a href="/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>).
