The altar, likely in the temple at Bethel, represents a place of worship that had become corrupted by idolatry. The presence of the Lord indicates His direct involvement in the judgment against Israel's unfaithfulness. This echoes other instances in Scripture where God appears in visions to prophets, such as Isaiah's vision in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, emphasizing His holiness and sovereignty.<p><b>and He said: &#8220;Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake.</b><br>The command to strike the tops of the pillars suggests a divine act of destruction against the places of false worship. Pillars were often structural supports in temples, and their destruction would lead to the collapse of the building. This imagery is reminiscent of Samson's destruction of the Philistine temple in <a href="/judges/16-29.htm">Judges 16:29-30</a>. The shaking of the thresholds symbolizes the complete destabilization of Israel's religious and social structures due to their sin.<p><b>Topple them on the heads of all the people,</b><br>This phrase indicates a comprehensive judgment that affects all who are complicit in the idolatrous practices. The imagery of the structure collapsing on the people highlights the inescapable nature of God's judgment. It serves as a warning that those who participate in or support false worship will face dire consequences, similar to the judgment seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>and I will kill the rest with the sword.</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol of divine judgment and warfare. This phrase underscores the totality of God's judgment, extending beyond the immediate destruction of the temple to those who survive. It reflects the severity of God's response to sin, as seen in other prophetic warnings, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29-31</a>, where the sword is used as a metaphor for God's wrath.<p><b>None of those who flee will get away; none of the fugitives will escape.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the inevitability and thoroughness of God's judgment. It assures that no one can escape divine justice, reinforcing the theme of accountability for sin. This is consistent with other biblical passages that declare the inescapability of God's judgment, such as in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>, which speaks to God's omnipresence and the futility of trying to hide from Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, depicted here as executing judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Likely a reference to the altar in the temple, symbolizing the place of worship and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pillars.htm">Pillars</a></b><br>Structural elements of the temple, representing stability and strength, which are to be struck down as a sign of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The Israelites, who are subject to God's judgment due to their sins and rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>A symbol of divine judgment and destruction, indicating the severity of God's wrath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God stands as the ultimate authority over His creation, and His judgments are just and righteous.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, and God's holiness demands that sin be addressed and judged.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_divine_justice.htm">The Inevitability of Divine Justice</a></b><br>No one can escape God's judgment; it is comprehensive and unavoidable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_repentance.htm">The Call to Repentance</a></b><br>While judgment is certain, God's desire is for repentance and restoration.

The prophet sees Jehovah Himself standing in pomp by the altar of burnt offering, and by His side the angel of His presence, to whom now, as on many other occasions, the mission of destruction has been entrusted. To him the words of Jehovah are addressed (so Aben Ezra, Kimchi). It is doubtful what is meant by the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Caphtor</span> (mistranslated "lintel of the door"). It may mean the wreathed capital of the columns, as in <a href="/zephaniah/2-14.htm" title="And flocks shall lie down in the middle of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.">Zephaniah 2:14</a>. So Hitzig and Keil. The word <span class= "ital">sippim</span> (mistranslated "posts") properly signifies "thresholds," but is here understood by the first-mentioned commentator to mean the cornice supported by the columns. This is confirmed by the LXX. on <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a> (see Delitzsch <span class= "ital">ad loc</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> But as there is no mention of the temple building, but only of the altar of burnt offering, it is much safer to adhere to the ordinary and well-established significations of these terms. We should accordingly follow Ewald in taking <span class= "ital">Caphtor</span> as referring to the <span class= "ital">ornamented horns of the altar.</span> Similarly, in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-17.htm" title="And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:">Exodus 37:17</a>, it signifies the richly decorated extremities of the golden <span class= "ital">candelabra.</span> The scene is wonderfully vivid. Round the colossal altar of burnt offering a crowd of eager devotees is gathered. Jehovah gives the word of command to His angel, and with a blow that shakes the very threshold the ornamented altar horns are shivered to fragments, which are hurled down upon the panic-stricken multitude below.<p><span class= "bld">And cut</span> . . .--Rather, <span class= "ital">and dash them in pieces upon the head of all of them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - &sect; 6<span class="accented">. The fifth vision displays the Lord standing by the altar and</span> commanding the destruction of the temple (ver. 1). No one shall escape this judgment, flee whither he will (vers. 2-4); for God is Almighty (vers. 5, 6). Their election shall not save the guilty Israelites; still they shall not be utterly destroyed (vers. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw the Lord.</span> It is now no longer a mere emblem that the prophet sees, but actual destruction. He beholds the majesty of God, as <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Upon</span> (or, by) <span class="cmt_word">the altar;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the altar of burnt offering at Jerusalem, Where, it is supposed, the whole nation, Israelites and Judaeans, are assembled for worship. It is natural, at first sight, to suppose that the sanctuary of the northern kingdom is the scene of this vision, as the destruction of idolatry is here emblemized; but more probably Bethel is not meant, for there were more altars than one there (<a href="/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>), and one cannot imagine the Lord standing by the symbol of the calf worship. <span class="cmt_word">Smite</span>. The command is mysteriously addressed to the destroying angel (comp. <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>, etc.; <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The lintel of the door;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">cardinem</span> (Vulgate); better, <span class="accented">the chapiter</span> (<a href="/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the capital of the columns. The word <span class="accented">kaphtor</span> is used in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, etc., for the knop or ornament on the golden candlesticks; here the idea is that the temple receives a blow on the top of the pillars which support it sufficient to cause its overthrow. The LXX. rendering arises from a confusion of two Hebrew words somewhat similar. <span class="cmt_word">The posts;</span> <span class="accented">the thresholds</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the base. The knop and the threshold imply the total destruction from summit to base. <span class="cmt_word">Cut them in the head, all of them;</span> rather, <span class="accented">break them</span> [<span class="accented">the capital and the thresholds</span>] <span class="accented">to pieces upon the head of all.</span> Let the falling building cover them with its ruins. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">avaritia enim in capite omnium</span>, confounding two words. Jerome had the same Hebrew reading, as he translates, <span class="accented">quaetus eorum, avaritia</span>, as if giving the reason for the punishment. The overthrown temple presents a forcible picture of the destruction of the theocracy. <span class="cmt_word">The last of them</span> (<a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>); <span class="accented">the remnant</span>; any who escape the fall of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">He that fleeth,</span> etc. All hope of escape shall be cut off. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">standing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5324.htm">Strong's 5324: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take one's stand, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">beside</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the altar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;miz&#183;b&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
