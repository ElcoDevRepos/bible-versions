The "Pride of Jacob" can be understood as a reference to God Himself, as He is the true glory and pride of Israel. In biblical context, oaths were binding and sacred, often invoking something of great significance. The use of "Jacob" refers to the patriarch whose descendants became the nation of Israel, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and His people. This phrase underscores God's authority and the certainty of His declarations.<p><b>I will never forget any of their deeds.</b><br>This statement is a declaration of divine judgment. The context of Amos is a time of social injustice and religious hypocrisy in Israel. God, through Amos, is addressing the sins of the Israelites, particularly their exploitation of the poor and corruption. The phrase "never forget" implies that God is fully aware of their actions and that there will be consequences. This reflects the biblical principle that God is just and holds people accountable for their actions. It also connects to other scriptures where God remembers both the righteous and the wicked (e.g., <a href="/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).

Just as <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind,&#8221; God&#8217;s sworn word stands beyond dispute.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a> reminds us that God underscores His promises &#8220;with an oath&#8221; to show their absolute certainty.<p>&#8226; Because the Lord&#8217;s character is perfectly truthful (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>), His oath is not a concession to human doubt but a gracious confirmation of inevitable reality.<p>&#8226; In Amos, this solemn declaration sets the weighty tone: judgment is not a possibility; it is a settled decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the Pride of Jacob</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Pride of Jacob&#8221; points to the LORD Himself, the true glory of Israel&#8212;echoing <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>, &#8220;The Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier in <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>, God swears &#8220;by His holiness.&#8221; Here He swears &#8220;by the Pride of Jacob,&#8221; stressing that He, the covenant God of the patriarchs, is both witness and guarantor.<p>&#8226; The phrase also exposes Israel&#8217;s misplaced confidence. Their national pride had shifted from their covenant God to their own prosperity (cf. <a href="/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). By invoking the title, God reminds them who alone is worthy of boasting (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus, the oath appeals to the highest authority in existence&#8212;God&#8217;s own holy character&#8212;and simultaneously indicts a people who had forgotten that very glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will never forget any of their deeds</b><p>&#8226; The promise is sobering: none of Israel&#8217;s unjust actions will slip past divine memory. <a href="/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a> echoes, &#8220;He will now remember their iniquity and call their sins to account.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;never forget&#8221; is not passive recollection but active reckoning. <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a> portrays books opened, confirming that every deed faces perfect review.<p>&#8226; Amos has catalogued those deeds&#8212;trampling the needy (8:4), rigging scales (8:5), buying the poor for sandals (8:6). Each injustice is etched into the record awaiting judgment.<p>&#8226; Yet the certainty of divine memory also implies hope for those who repent. <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a> promises that when the wicked forsake their ways, the Lord &#8220;will abundantly pardon.&#8221; Unrepented sin is remembered; forgiven sin is removed &#8220;as far as the east is from the west&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God binds His own name to an oath, reminding Israel that He is their true glory and that every unrepented deed stands recorded before Him. His unchanging character guarantees that judgment on injustice is sure, yet His very faithfulness offers mercy to any who turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Excellency of Jacob.--</span>In the previous use of this remarkable expression (<a href="/amos/6-8.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, said the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.">Amos 6:8</a>) Jehovah is said to abhor it, but here He swears by it. The "excellency" which He abhorred was the miserable substitute which they had made for His great Name.
