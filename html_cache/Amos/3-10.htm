Despite being God's chosen people, they have become so entrenched in their sinful ways that they have lost the ability to discern right from wrong. This echoes the condition described in <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, where good is called evil and evil good. The phrase suggests a willful ignorance, as they have rejected the teachings and commandments of God. This spiritual blindness is a result of persistent disobedience and idolatry, which has dulled their conscience and understanding.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The authority of this statement is underscored by the declaration coming directly from the LORD. It emphasizes that this is not merely a human observation but a divine pronouncement. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that authenticates the message as coming from God Himself, similar to the declarations found throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8-9</a>. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate judge of human actions.<p><b>They store up violence and destruction in their citadels.</b><br>This phrase paints a vivid picture of the societal corruption and the accumulation of injustice within Israel. The "citadels" refer to fortified places, often the centers of power and wealth, indicating that the leaders and those in authority are complicit in these acts. The imagery of storing up violence and destruction suggests a deliberate and ongoing accumulation of sin, much like treasures stored in a vault. This is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18-19</a> about the consequences of greed and violence. The phrase also foreshadows the impending judgment and destruction that will come upon Israel as a result of their actions, aligning with the prophetic warnings of destruction found in other parts of Amos, such as <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver messages of judgment to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Amos to declare His judgment against Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which had fallen into idolatry and social injustice, prompting God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/citadels.htm">Citadels</a></b><br>Fortified structures or strongholds in cities, symbolizing places of power and wealth where the leaders of Israel stored their ill-gotten gains.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/violence_and_destruction.htm">Violence and Destruction</a></b><br>The sinful behaviors and consequences of Israel's leaders, who oppressed the poor and engaged in corrupt practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_righteousness.htm">Understanding Righteousness</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "right" (yashar) implies straightness or uprightness.

<a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This ignorance is not intellectual but moral; they &#8220;know&#8221; the Law yet refuse to live by it, echoing <a href="/psalms/36-1.htm">Psalm 36:1-3</a>, where sin whispers deceitfully in a man&#8217;s heart until he &#8220;no longer fears God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase also signals impending judgment: when knowledge of right is lost, justice from God swiftly follows (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>&#8226; These words underscore divine authority; the message is not Amos&#8217;s opinion but God&#8217;s unassailable verdict (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3, 6, 9</a>).<p>&#8226;

Violence and destruction are treated like treasures, revealing a twisted value system: instead of sowing righteousness they bank on cruelty (<a href="/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Such stored-up sin invites stored-up wrath; <a href="/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a> warns, &#8220;You have stored up treasure in the last days,&#8221; and <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a> links the same imagery to divine judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in their citadels</b><p>&#8226;

Trusting in walls and wealth is futile; Obadiah 3 shows Edom boasting in high dwellings only to be brought low, while <a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a> notes that a rich man&#8217;s wealth is &#8220;a high wall in his imagination.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God will penetrate every fortress; <a href="/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a> immediately announces an enemy who &#8220;will topple your strongholds,&#8221; proving that no citadel can shelter unrepentant sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a> reveals a people so steeped in sin that righteousness feels alien. God Himself announces the charge, leaving no room for debate. The nation&#8217;s wealth is built on violence, and their fortified palaces merely warehouse the evidence. Because they have stockpiled injustice, they are about to reap the just response of a holy God. The verse stands as both a historical indictment of Israel and a timeless warning: when a society normalizes wrongdoing and trusts in material defenses, divine judgment is inevitable unless repentance intervenes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Know not to do right.--</span>Not merely have lost the perception of what is and what is not right, <span class= "ital">but</span> are indifferent to such distinctions.
