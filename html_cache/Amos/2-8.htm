Altars were meant for worship and sacrifice to God, but the people were using them for personal comfort and indulgence. This behavior reflects a disregard for the holiness of God&#8217;s commands. In the ancient Near East, altars were central to religious life, and lying down beside them suggests a casual, irreverent attitude towards worship. This can be compared to the warning in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>, where God expresses disdain for empty rituals.<p><b>on garments taken in pledge</b><br>The taking of garments in pledge refers to the practice of holding a debtor's cloak as collateral for a loan, as described in <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>. The law required that such garments be returned by evening, as they were often the only covering the poor had. The Israelites' failure to return these garments shows a lack of compassion and justice, violating the spirit of the law. This exploitation of the poor is condemned throughout the prophets, such as in <a href="/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>And in the house of their God</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Israelites were committing these acts within places of worship, which were supposed to be dedicated to God. The term "house of their God" suggests a syncretism where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with pagan practices. This is reminiscent of the idolatry condemned in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-31</a>, where Jeroboam set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan.<p><b>they drink wine obtained through fines</b><br>The wine mentioned here was acquired through unjust fines imposed on the poor, highlighting the corruption and greed of the leaders. This exploitation is a direct violation of the covenantal laws meant to protect the vulnerable, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>. The consumption of such wine in a religious setting further underscores the hypocrisy and moral decay of the society.
