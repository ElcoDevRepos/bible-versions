The reference to these cities serves as a powerful reminder of God's capacity for judgment against sin and rebellion. Sodom and Gomorrah were known for their extreme wickedness, and their destruction by fire and brimstone became a symbol of divine retribution. By comparing Israel to these cities, the text underscores the severity of Israel's sin and the seriousness of God's warnings. This also highlights the historical reality of God's past judgments, serving as a warning to the Israelites of the consequences of their continued disobedience.<p><b>and you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze</b><br>The imagery of a firebrand, or a burning stick, snatched from a blaze suggests a narrow escape from complete destruction. This metaphor indicates that although Israel faced severe judgment, they were spared total annihilation by God's mercy. The concept of being "snatched" implies divine intervention and grace, suggesting that God provided opportunities for repentance and redemption. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, where Joshua the high priest is described as a "brand plucked from the fire," symbolizing God's deliverance and mercy.<p><b>yet you did not return to Me</b><br>Despite the warnings and acts of mercy, Israel's failure to return to God highlights their stubbornness and spiritual blindness. The call to "return" is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing repentance and restoration of the covenant relationship with God. This phrase reflects the persistent unfaithfulness of Israel, despite God's repeated calls for repentance. It echoes the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for His people to turn back to Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a> and <a href="/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14:1-2</a>.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase affirms the authority and authenticity of the message, emphasizing that it is not merely the prophet's words but a divine pronouncement. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that underscores the seriousness and certainty of the message. It serves as a reminder that the warnings and judgments are not arbitrary but are rooted in the character and will of God. This declaration invites the audience to respond with reverence and obedience, recognizing the sovereignty of God over their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and repentance to the northern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Ancient cities known for their wickedness and subsequently destroyed by God as a demonstration of His judgment (Genesis 19).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often characterized by idolatry and social injustice during the time of Amos.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who calls His people to repentance and righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/firebrand.htm">Firebrand</a></b><br>A burning stick pulled from the fire, symbolizing Israel's narrow escape from complete destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment_and_mercy.htm">God's Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>God&#8217;s judgment is real and severe, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

This is no vague misfortune; it is deliberate judgment, just as earlier in the chapter He sent famine, drought, blight, mildew, plague, and war (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6&#8211;10</a>). &#8226; <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a> shows how the northern kingdom eventually fell under the same divine hand. &#8226; <a href="/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a> speaks of an &#8220;enemy surrounding the land&#8221; as another act of overthrow. Each calamity was designed to jolt the nation awake.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah</b><p>The benchmark for sudden, fiery destruction is <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>, where &#8220;the LORD rained down fire and brimstone.&#8221; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50-40.htm">Jeremiah 50:40</a> both cite Sodom and Gomorrah as cautionary tales for later generations. By invoking them, God is saying, &#8220;I treated you with the severity reserved for the worst rebellion&#8212;yet I left you standing.&#8221; Even Jesus employs the same comparison in <a href="/luke/17-29.htm">Luke 17:29-30</a> when warning of final judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze</b><p>Picture a half-burned stick jerked from the flames at the last second. <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a> echoes this image: &#8220;Is not this man a brand plucked from the fire?&#8221; Jude 23 urges believers to &#8220;save others, snatching them out of the fire.&#8221; In every case the imagery stresses mercy in the midst of wrath: spared, smoking, but alive. Israel&#8217;s continued existence was itself proof of God&#8217;s rescuing hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet you did not return to Me</b><p>Five times in this chapter the refrain sounds (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6, 8, 9, 10, 11</a>). Every fresh disaster was a mercy-laden invitation to repent, but the nation chose stubbornness. <a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a> laments the same hard heart: &#8220;They made their faces harder than rock.&#8221; <a href="/hosea/7-10.htm">Hosea 7:10</a> notes that pride kept Ephraim from returning. God&#8217;s patience is staggering, yet not endless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>The closing signature underscores authority and finality. When the prophets append these words (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), they are not offering suggestions; they are delivering the very verdict of heaven. To disregard such a declaration is to reject the Lord Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a> portrays a God who judges decisively yet spares mercifully. Israel had already felt Sodom-like shocks and had been pulled back from total ruin &#8220;like a firebrand snatched from a blaze.&#8221; These acts were meant to drive the people to heartfelt repentance, but they refused. The verse therefore stands as both a record of divine mercy and a sober warning: continued rebellion in the face of such grace leaves no excuse when the final judgment falls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Overthrown.</span>--Another awful calamity, an earthquake, is referred to, and perhaps a volcanic eruption.
