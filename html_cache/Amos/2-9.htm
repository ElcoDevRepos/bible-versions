The Amorites were a powerful Canaanite people who occupied the land before the Israelites. God's destruction of the Amorites is a reminder of His sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land. This act of divine intervention underscores God's role as a warrior on behalf of His people, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>though his height was like that of the cedars</b><br>The comparison to cedars highlights the formidable nature of the Amorites. Cedars, particularly those from Lebanon, were known for their great height and strength, symbolizing the Amorites' imposing presence and power. This imagery is used to convey the seemingly insurmountable challenge they posed to Israel, yet God was able to overcome them, demonstrating His superior power.<p><b>and he was as strong as the oaks</b><br>Oaks are another symbol of strength and endurance. This phrase further emphasizes the might and resilience of the Amorites, suggesting that they were deeply entrenched and difficult to defeat. The use of natural imagery to describe the Amorites' strength serves to magnify the miraculous nature of their defeat by God's hand, reinforcing the idea that no earthly power can withstand God's will.<p><b>Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below</b><br>This phrase signifies a complete and total destruction of the Amorites. The "fruit above" and "roots below" indicate that God eradicated both the visible and hidden aspects of their power and influence. This thorough destruction ensured that the Amorites could not recover or pose a future threat to Israel. It also serves as a metaphor for God's ability to address both the surface issues and the deeper, underlying problems in the lives of His people. This comprehensive victory is a testament to God's thoroughness in executing judgment and fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages to the northern kingdom of Israel.

He singles out the Amorites&#8212;iconic Canaanite warriors who once dominated the land (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The emphasis on &#8220;I&#8221; underlines covenant faithfulness. As in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, &#8220;The LORD will fight for you,&#8221; the Lord took the battlefield position, clearing the way for His people (<a href="/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement confronts Israel&#8217;s current complacency. Forgetting past grace leads to present rebellion; remembering fuels obedience (<a href="/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though his height was like that of the cedars</b><p>&#8226; Cedars of Lebanon were ancient symbols of towering grandeur (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). Describing Amorite height this way recalls the intimidating report of the spies who felt &#8220;like grasshoppers&#8221; beside the giants of the land (<a href="/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s past triumph over what looked humanly impossible assures His people that no present foe is too large (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison also highlights the distance between appearance and reality: seeming strength collapses when the Lord steps in (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he was as strong as the oaks</b><p>&#8226; Oaks suggest endurance and deep-rooted strength (<a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>). The Amorites&#8217; military entrenchment in the hill country of Judah and Ephraim (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34-35</a>) felt immovable.<p>&#8226; By pairing &#8220;cedars&#8221; with &#8220;oaks,&#8221; the Lord addresses both height (outward impressiveness) and depth (entrenched power). Neither dimension withstands divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-8</a> contrasting cursed shrubs and blessed trees).<p>&#8226; Present readers are reminded that human fortresses&#8212;political, cultural, or personal&#8212;are no match for God&#8217;s sovereign will (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below</b><p>&#8226; The double action pictures total eradication&#8212;branches and offspring (&#8220;fruit above&#8221;) as well as heritage and future (&#8220;roots below&#8221;).

Their cities, armies, and dynasties were wiped out, leaving no regrowth.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the verse signals the completeness of divine justice. When repentance is rejected, God&#8217;s judgment is thorough (<a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). Conversely, in Christ, salvation is just as comprehensive&#8212;He uproots sin&#8217;s penalty and breaks its fruit in our lives (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a> recalls God&#8217;s past victory over the seemingly invincible Amorites to expose Israel&#8217;s ingratitude and warn against complacency.
