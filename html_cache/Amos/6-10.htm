The act of burning bodies indicates a severe plague or disaster, as burial was the customary practice. Burning was often reserved for extreme cases, such as in times of pestilence or when bodies were too numerous to bury. This reflects the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about judgment due to Israel's sins (<a href="/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>).<p><b>he will call to one inside, &#8220;Is anyone else with you?&#8221;</b><br>The inquiry suggests a scene of desolation and fear. The relative's question indicates the expectation of finding more victims, highlighting the widespread devastation. This also reflects the breakdown of community and family structures, as survivors are scarce.<p><b>&#8220;None,&#8221; that person will answer.</b><br>The response underscores the totality of the calamity. The absence of survivors points to the thoroughness of God's judgment. This echoes the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah about the consequences of Israel's disobedience (<a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11-12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/9-21.htm">Jeremiah 9:21</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; the relative will retort,</b><br>The command for silence suggests a deep reverence or fear. In the context of judgment, silence can be a response to the overwhelming presence of God's holiness and wrath. It may also indicate a cultural practice of mourning or a fear of invoking further divine wrath.<p><b>&#8220;for the name of the LORD must not be invoked.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects a fear of speaking God's name in a context of judgment, possibly to avoid further provocation of His anger. It highlights the seriousness of the situation and the recognition of God's sovereignty and holiness. The prohibition against invoking God's name in vain is rooted in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>), emphasizing the sacredness of His name.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/relative.htm">Relative</a></b><br>This person is responsible for the grim task of burning the bodies, indicating a time of great calamity and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Represents the place of death and desolation, a symbol of the judgment that has come upon the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_name_of_the_lord.htm">The Name of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred name of God, which the relative instructs not to invoke, highlighting the severity of the situation and the fear of further judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_severity_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Severity of God's Judgment</a></b><br><a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a> illustrates the seriousness of God's judgment on Israel.

The verse drives home the completeness of divine discipline, the collapse of human confidence, and the reverent fear that arises when a people finally recognize the seriousness of misusing God&#8217;s holy name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The prophet gives an instance of the terror and misery in that common calamity.

This is the same person as the kinsman. the butler; but tot some reason, either from the number of deaths, or from the pestilence, or from the distance of the burying place, which would be out of the city and inaccessible in the blockade, he cannot lay the body in the brave, and is forced to take and burn it. Though the Jews generally buried dead bodies, cremation was sometimes used, both in honour or emergency (<a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) and in punishment (<a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The bones;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the corpse, as in <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>; and <a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>; Keil.

It is too late to call upon God now; it is the time of vengeance. We rejected him in life; we may not cry to him in death. St. Jerome refers the prohibition to the hardness of heart and unbelief of the people, who even in all this misery will not confess the name of the Lord. Keil says, "It indicates a fear lest, by the invocation of the name of God, his eye should be drawn towards this last remaining one, and he also should fall a victim to the judgment of death." Others again think that the notion in the mind of the impious speaker is that Jehovah is the Author of all their calamities, and that he is impatient at the very mention of his name. The simplest explanation is the first, or a modification of it The person addressed is about to pray or to call on God in his distress. "Be silent," says the speaker; "we can no longer appeal to Jehovah as the covenant God; by naming him we call to his remembrance how we have broken the covenant, violated our relation to him; therefore provoke him not further by making mention of his name." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when the relative</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
