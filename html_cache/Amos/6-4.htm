Ivory was a rare and expensive material, often imported from distant lands, indicating significant wealth and trade connections. Archaeological findings in Samaria have uncovered ivory carvings, supporting the historical context of such luxury. The use of ivory in furniture suggests a focus on comfort and indulgence, contrasting with the call for justice and righteousness in the prophetic tradition. This opulence is condemned as it reflects a disregard for the poor and needy, aligning with the broader biblical theme of social justice found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a> and <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>.<p><b>and lounge upon your couches</b><br>The image of lounging suggests idleness and complacency, a lifestyle of ease that neglects the pressing issues of justice and righteousness. In the cultural context, couches were symbols of leisure and status, often used during banquets and feasts. This behavior is criticized by Amos as it reflects a self-indulgent lifestyle disconnected from the covenantal responsibilities of caring for the marginalized. The prophets frequently warned against such complacency, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9-11</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, where neglect of the poor is equated with sin.<p><b>You dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall</b><br>This phrase underscores the excessive consumption and indulgence in fine foods, which were typically reserved for special occasions or sacrifices. Lambs and calves were considered delicacies, and their consumption by the wealthy highlights a disregard for moderation and the needs of others. In the historical context, such feasting was often associated with pagan practices and idolatry, which the prophets condemned. The imagery here contrasts with the biblical ideal of stewardship and sharing resources, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a> and <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>.

Here, select lambs are consumed any day of the week.<p>&#8226; Such constant feasting echoes the revelry condemned in <a href="/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>: &#8220;Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away understanding.&#8221;<p>When the appetite rules, discernment withers.

Making that luxury routine exposed callous disregard for those in need.<p>&#8226; While these elites gorged themselves, the poor &#8220;sold themselves for a pair of sandals&#8221; (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Their banquets paralleled Belshazzar&#8217;s feast on the eve of Babylon&#8217;s fall (<a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1-4</a>), a party oblivious to God&#8217;s impending judgment.<p>Their unchecked indulgence hastened the moment when the LORD would &#8220;turn your feasts into mourning&#8221; (<a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a> condemns the ruling class&#8217;s lavish lifestyle, not because material blessings are evil, but because comfort had bred complacency, injustice, and spiritual apathy. Ivory beds, lounging couches, daily lamb, and grain-fed calves symbolize a people so absorbed in luxury that they ignored God&#8217;s covenant demands. The verse warns every generation: unchecked affluence, detached from compassion and obedience, invites divine judgment just as surely today as it did in Amos&#8217;s day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Of ivory</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, inlaid with that material.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That lie upon beds of ivory;</span> couches inlaid with ivory (see note on Amos 3:15) at meals.
