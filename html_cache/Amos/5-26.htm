The term "king" indicates the reverence and authority they attributed to this idol, which was contrary to their covenant with Yahweh. Historically, the Israelites were influenced by surrounding nations, often leading to syncretism. This reflects a period of spiritual decline where they replaced God's kingship with that of a false god, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>and Kaiwan your star god</b><br>Kaiwan, also known as Chiun in some translations, is associated with the worship of celestial bodies, particularly the planet Saturn. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of astrology and star worship, which was prevalent among Israel's neighbors. The Israelites' engagement in such practices was a direct violation of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, which warns against worshiping the host of heaven. This idolatry signifies a departure from the worship of the Creator to the creation, a theme Paul addresses in <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>.<p><b>the idols you made for yourselves</b><br>This phrase highlights the self-made nature of these idols, emphasizing human effort in creating objects of worship. It underscores the futility and absurdity of idolatry, as these gods were crafted by human hands and thus powerless (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The act of making idols reflects a deeper spiritual issue: the rejection of God's sovereignty and the pursuit of self-determined spirituality. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel's idolatry leads to judgment and exile, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages to the northern kingdom of Israel.

The connection with the context, the meaning of some of the terms, and whether the reference is to past, present, or future, are questions which have roused much controversy. We need not here recapitulate the various opinions which have been held. It will be sufficient to state what seems to be the simplest and most probable explanation of the passage. But we must not omit to mention first the explanation adopted by Ewald, Schrader, Farrar, Konig, and others, viz. that this verse refers to the punitive deportation which was to be the people's lot, when they should take their shrines and images with them into captivity. "So shall ye take (into exile) Sakkuth your king," etc. But the punishment is foretold in ver. 27; and this verse contrasts their idol worship with the neglected worship of Jehovah (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_word">But ye have borne;</span> <span class="accented">and ye bare</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">portastis</span> (Vulgate). Ye offered me no pure worship in the wilderness, seeing that ye took false gods with you, and joined their worship with, or substuted it for, mine. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of your Moloch;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">tabernaculum Moloch vestro</span> (Vulgate). The Hebrew word rendered "tabernacle" (<span class="accented">sikkuth</span>). which is found nowhere else, has been variously explained. Aquila gives <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>: Theodotion, "vision," reading the whole sentence thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Many moderns render, "stake," "column," or "shrine." Others suppose it to be equivalent to <span class="accented">Sakkuth</span>, an Assyrian name for Molech (or Adar); but this is very uncertain (see 'Studien und Kritiken.' 1874, p. 887), sad the parallelism requires the word to be an appellative and not a proper name. It most probably means "shrine," a portable shrine, like those spoken of in <a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a> in connection with the worship of Diana. The Syriac and Arabic versions call it "tent," and thus the reproach stands forth emphatically that, instead of, or in conjunction with, the true tabernacle, they bore aloft, as if proud of their apostasy, the tabernacle of a false god. Such shrines were used by the Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2:63, where see Rawlinson's note) and Diod. Sic. (1:97). Many such may be seen in the Egyptian room of the British Museum. Keil quotes Drumann, 'On the Rosetta Inscription,' p. 211, "These were small chapels, generally gilded and ornamented with flowers and in other ways, intended to hold a small idol when processions were made, and to be carried or driven about with it." Hence we must look to Egypt as the source of this idolatry. <span class="cmt_word">Moloch</span>, though sanctioned by the LXX. and St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>), is a mistranslation. De Rossi, indeed, mentions that one Hebrew manuscript gives <span class="accented">Moloch</span>, but the received reading is <span class="accented">Melkekem</span>, which is confirmed by Symmachus and Theodotion, who have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Syriac. The translation, therefore, should run, "Ye took up the shrine of your king," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of him whom ye made your king in the place of Jehovah, meaning some stellar divinity. <span class="cmt_word">And Chiun your images;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fec;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "and the star of your god Raephan "(Septuagint); <span class="accented">et imaginem idolorum vestrorum</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the kiyyun of your images.</span> The parallelism again requires us to take this unknown word as an appellative; and according to its probable derivation, its meaning is "pedestal," or "framework," that on which the image stood. The Greek rendering is, as Keil thinks, owing to a false reading of the unpointed text, in old Hebrew <span class="accented">kaph</span> and <span class="accented">resh</span> being easily confounded, and <span class="accented">vau</span> and <span class="accented">pe</span>. Theodotion considered the word a common noun, translating it by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is probably a mere coincidence that in some Assyrian inscriptions the name <span class="accented">Kairan</span> occurs as that of a deity, who is identified with Saturn; that the Egyptians (from whom the Israelites must have derived the notion) ever acknowledged such a deity is quite unproved. St. Stephen merely quotes the <span class="accented">Textus Receptus</span> of his day, which was close enough to the original for his argument. <span class="cmt_word">The star of your god.</span> These words are in loose apposition with the preceding, and are equivalent to "your star god," or the star whom ye worship as god. Whether some particular star is meant, or whether the sun is the deity signified, cannot be determined, although the universal prevalence of the worship of sun gods in Egypt makes the latter supposition very probable.
