In ancient times, having "clean teeth" implied a lack of food, as there was nothing to eat that would dirty the teeth. This judgment from God was a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience and idolatry. The cities, representing centers of population and influence, were targeted to emphasize the widespread nature of the judgment. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where God warned Israel of famine as a consequence of disobedience.<p><b>and all your towns with lack of bread</b><br>The "lack of bread" further emphasizes the severity of the famine. Bread was a staple food in ancient Israel, and its absence signifies a dire situation. This judgment was not limited to major cities but extended to all towns, indicating a comprehensive and inescapable divine action. The scarcity of bread is reminiscent of the curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-17.htm">Deuteronomy 28:17</a>, where God warns of the consequences of turning away from Him. This also foreshadows the spiritual famine mentioned in <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>, where there would be a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.<p><b>yet you did not return to Me</b><br>Despite the severe judgments, the people of Israel failed to repent and return to God. This highlights the stubbornness and hardness of their hearts. The call to "return" is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing God's desire for repentance and restoration. This phrase echoes the call to repentance found in <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>, where God invites His people to return with all their hearts. The lack of response from Israel underscores their spiritual blindness and rebellion.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>The declaration by the LORD underscores the authority and finality of the message. It is a reminder that these judgments are not random acts of nature but deliberate actions from God, who is sovereign over all creation. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that authenticates the message as coming directly from God. It serves as a solemn reminder of God's justice and the seriousness of His call to repentance. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant relationship with Israel, where He consistently calls His people back to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver messages of judgment to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and social injustice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is calling His people to repentance through the prophet Amos.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_israel.htm">Cities of Israel</a></b><br>The urban centers where the people experienced the consequences of their disobedience, such as famine and lack of resources.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A divine judgment used by God to prompt Israel to return to Him, symbolized by "cleanness of teeth" due to lack of food.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_discipline.htm">Divine Discipline</a></b><br>God uses circumstances, such as famine, to discipline His people and draw them back to Himself.

The verse thus warns that persistent disregard for God&#8217;s corrective hand will only heighten accountability, while also affirming that every act of discipline is motivated by His desire for a restored relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Cleanness of teeth</span> is, by the poetic parallelism, identified with the want of bread, the former phrase being a graphic representation of one of the ghastly aspects of famine; clean, sharp, prominent teeth projecting from the thin lips.
