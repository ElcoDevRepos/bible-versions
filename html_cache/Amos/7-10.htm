Bethel was one of the two locations where Jeroboam I set up golden calves for worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>), leading Israel into idolatry. As a priest at Bethel, Amaziah was likely aligned with the state-sponsored religious practices that opposed the true worship of Yahweh. His role suggests a conflict between the established religious order and the prophetic message of Amos, who was calling for repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel</b><br>Jeroboam II was the king of Israel during Amos's prophetic ministry. His reign was marked by economic prosperity and territorial expansion (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>), but also by social injustice and religious corruption. By sending a message to Jeroboam, Amaziah was attempting to protect the status quo and suppress Amos's message, which threatened the king's authority and the nation's complacency. This reflects the tension between political power and prophetic truth.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Amos has conspired against you</b><br>Amaziah accuses Amos of conspiracy, a serious charge implying treason or rebellion against the king. This accusation distorts Amos's prophetic mission, which was not political insurrection but a divine call to repentance. The charge of conspiracy highlights the misunderstanding and rejection of prophetic voices by those in power, a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in the lives of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>).<p><b>in the midst of the house of Israel.</b><br>The phrase "in the midst of the house of Israel" indicates that Amos's message was delivered openly and directly to the people of Israel. This public proclamation underscores the urgency and importance of his message. The "house of Israel" refers to the northern kingdom, which had strayed from the covenant with God. Amos's presence and message in their midst serve as a direct confrontation to their spiritual and moral failings.<p><b>The land cannot bear all his words,</b><br>Amaziah's statement that "the land cannot bear all his words" suggests that Amos's prophecies were seen as intolerable and threatening to the social and political stability of Israel. This reflects the discomfort and resistance often faced by prophets who speak God's truth to a wayward people. The land's inability to bear Amos's words can be seen as a metaphor for the people's unwillingness to accept divine correction, similar to the rejection of other prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>) and Jesus Christ, who was also rejected by His own (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The priest of Bethel, representing the religious establishment of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

The chief priest of the Temple, with the characteristic exaggeration of fear and anger, accuses Amos of treason against the house of Jeroboam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">This bold prophecy, no longer conceived in general terms or referring to distant times, but distinct and personal, arouses the animosity of the priestly authorities at Bethel, who accuse Amos before the king, and warn him to leave the country without more words, or to fear the worst.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amaziah the priest of Bethel.</span> Amaziah ("the Lord is strong"), the chief of the idol priests at Bethel, a crafty and determined man, hearing this prophecy against the royal house, takes it up as a political matter, and makes a formal accusation against Amos with the view of silencing him. <span class="cmt_word">Hath conspired against thee.</span> Probably some of the Israelites had been convinced by the prophet's words, and had joined themselves to him; hence Amaziah speaks of "a conspiracy" (<a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>) against the king. Or very possibly the story was fabricated in order to accentuate the charge against Amos. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the house of Israel.</span> In the very centre of the kingdom, where his treasonable speeches would have the greatest effect. The land, personified, cannot endure such language, which is calculated to disturb its peace, and is quite contrary to its ideas and hopes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/7-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Amaziah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;ma&#7779;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_558.htm">Strong's 558: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amaziah -- 'Yah is mighty', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Bethel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1008.htm">Strong's 1008: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bethel -- 'house of God', a city in Ephraim, also a place in southern Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
