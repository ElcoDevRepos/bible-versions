Amos, a shepherd and fig tree farmer from Tekoa, was called by God to prophesy to the Northern Kingdom of Israel. His role as a prophet is significant because it shows that God can call anyone, regardless of their social status or occupation, to deliver His message.<p><b>&#8220;Lord GOD,</b><br>The use of "Lord GOD" reflects a deep reverence and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and authority. The Hebrew term used here is "Adonai Yahweh," emphasizing both God's lordship and His covenant relationship with Israel. This dual title underscores the seriousness of Amos's plea and the recognition of God's power to enact or withhold judgment.<p><b>please stop!</b><br>Amos intercedes on behalf of Israel, asking God to relent from His planned judgment. This reflects the role of a prophet not only as a messenger but also as an intercessor. It parallels the intercessory roles of figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>), who also pleaded with God to spare His people.<p><b>How will Jacob survive,</b><br>"Jacob" is a reference to the nation of Israel, named after the patriarch Jacob, whose descendants formed the twelve tribes. This plea highlights the vulnerability of Israel and the impending danger they face due to their sins. It reflects a deep concern for the survival of God's chosen people, despite their waywardness.<p><b>since he is so small?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Israel's perceived weakness and insignificance in the face of divine judgment. Historically, Israel was a relatively small nation compared to the surrounding empires like Assyria and Egypt. The imagery of smallness conveys a sense of helplessness and the need for divine mercy. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of God using the weak and humble to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and repentance to Israel.
