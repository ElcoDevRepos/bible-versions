The promise includes God's commitment to be with His people, to guide them, and to make them a nation set apart for His purposes. This covenant is foundational, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God calls Israel His treasured possession. The reference to Egypt serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and deliverance, emphasizing His unchanging nature. The historical context of the Exodus is crucial, as it was a defining moment for Israel, shaping their identity and relationship with God. This promise is echoed throughout the Old Testament, reinforcing God's enduring commitment to His people.<p><b>And My Spirit remains among you;</b><br>The presence of God's Spirit among the Israelites signifies His ongoing guidance and support. In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God often represents His power and presence, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>) and the empowerment of leaders like Moses and Joshua. This assurance of God's Spirit is a source of comfort and strength, especially during times of rebuilding and renewal, such as the post-exilic period when Haggai prophesied. Theologically, this points to the New Testament promise of the Holy Spirit dwelling within believers, as seen in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a> and <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>, highlighting continuity in God's plan for His people.<p><b>do not be afraid.&#8221;</b><br>This command addresses the fears and uncertainties faced by the Israelites as they worked to rebuild the temple amidst opposition and limited resources. Fear is a common theme in Scripture, often countered by God's reassurance of His presence and power. In <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, God similarly tells His people not to fear, for He is with them. This encouragement is vital for maintaining faith and perseverance. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament message of peace and courage found in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, where Jesus tells His disciples not to let their hearts be troubled or afraid.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haggai.htm">Haggai</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile, encouraging them to rebuild the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and later returned from Babylonian exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, which was being rebuilt during Haggai's ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>The presence of God that remained with the Israelites, providing assurance and courage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promise to be with His people is consistent throughout history, from the Exodus to the rebuilding of the temple.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit of God is a source of strength and courage, enabling believers to overcome fear and accomplish God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_obedience.htm">Courage in Obedience</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to rebuild the temple without fear, we are called to pursue God's purposes with confidence in His presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_of_god's_promises.htm">Continuity of God's Promises</a></b><br>The promises made to the Israelites are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers, assuring us of God's unchanging nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_fear.htm">Overcoming Fear</a></b><br>Fear is a natural response, but God's presence and promises empower us to face challenges with faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Haggai_2_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Haggai 2:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Haggai_2_5_Trust_in_God_s_presence.htm">How does Haggai 2:5 encourage us to trust in God's abiding presence today?

By recalling that historic rescue, He underlines that:<p>&#8226;&#8195;His covenant faithfulness did not lapse with generations; the same Lord who opened the Red Sea is speaking now.<p>&#8226;&#8195;The pledge involved both deliverance and dwelling: &#8220;I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;He had promised to be present in their midst (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-13</a>). Rebuilding the temple in Haggai&#8217;s day was not about erecting a mere structure; it was about renewing visible fellowship with the God who never broke His word (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-10</a>).<p>By anchoring their current task in an ancient promise, the Lord assures the remnant that their labor is part of a story He Himself began&#8212;and will complete.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And My Spirit remains among you</b><p>The people may have felt small compared to the earlier glory of Solomon&#8217;s temple, yet God says His Spirit is still there. Key implications:<p>&#8226;&#8195;Continuity of Presence: Just as the cloud and fire led Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), so the Spirit guides and empowers them now (<a href="/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Sufficiency of Power: Human resources were limited, but &#8220; &#8216;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,&#8217; says the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Covenant Assurance: The indwelling Spirit signals God&#8217;s unbroken commitment (<a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11-14</a>). Later, Christ would echo the same reality to His church: &#8220;Surely I am with you always&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>What mattered most was not the size of the project but the presence of the Spirit. That truth transforms discouragement into confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not be afraid</b><p>Because covenant promise and abiding Spirit are already in place, fear has no rightful hold. Notice how &#8220;do not be afraid&#8221; consistently flows from God&#8217;s presence:<p>&#8226;&#8195;Joshua heard it when facing fortified Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5-9</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Hezekiah heard it when Assyria threatened Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/19-6.htm">2 Kings 19:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;The disciples heard it when Jesus stilled the storm (<a href="/matthew/14-27.htm">Matthew 14:27</a>).<p>Fear shrinks when God is near. For the remnant, opposition, scarcity, and memories of past glory could have paralyzed them. Yet the Lord calls them to focus on His steadfast word and Spirit, not on intimidating circumstances. <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5-6</a> echoes the same pattern for believers today: &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8230; The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a> links past redemption, present empowerment, and future confidence. The God who once split the sea still stands with His people, His Spirit actively present. Because His covenant promise is unbreakable and His Spirit unmovable, fear becomes unnecessary and obedience becomes possible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/haggai/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">According to the word.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with the word.</span> The clause is connected with the closing words of <a href="/haggai/2-4.htm" title="Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, said the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land, said the LORD, and work: for I am with you, said the LORD of hosts:">Haggai 2:4</a>. Jehovah is present with them, and so is His Promise made by solemn covenant in the days of old.<p><span class= "bld">So my spirit.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and my spirit.</span> Besides such promises of God's abiding favour as <a href="/context/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45-46</a>, they have among them the abiding presence of His Holy Spirit. Having these, let them not be afraid. The evidence of the Divine Presence was the mission of inspired prophets, such as Haggai and Zechariah, and the Targum and the Rabbis are perhaps right in referring the words "and my spirit" exclusively to the "spirit of <span class= "ital">prophecy.</span>" It may be noticed that the later Jews held that the Holy Spirit left the Church after the deaths of Zechariah and Malachi.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the word that I covenanted.</span> The Hebrew is simply, "the word that I," etc. Hence some have connected it with the verb "do" in the preceding verse, the intervening words being parenthetical. But there is intended no injunction respecting the observation of the old covenant, but a consolatory message under present despondency. Others take it with the verb that fallows: "the word and my Spirit remain among you." but it is best to leave the clause in the abrupt fashion in which it is introduced: "(Here is, here stands) the word that I covenanted with you." If anything is supplied, we might insert, "I will confirm." The promise of present help is confirmed by the remembrance of God's former covenant with Israel, that they should be his peculiar people and possess the right of access to him and a claim on his help (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45, 46</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>). This clause is entirely omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">So my Spirit remaineth among you;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and my Spirit abode among you.</span> But the clause refers to God's presence among them now, which was shown by the revelations made to the prophets, as Haggai and Zechariah, and which exhibits itself in his providential ordering of events, the removal of obstacles, the furthering of the good work. Wordsworth notes that "Christ was with the ancient Church in the wilderness (see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-9.htm">1 Corinthians 10:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>); and now, when the eternal <span class="accented">Word</span> became incarnate, and when the <span class="accented">Holy Spirit</span> was sent to be <span class="accented">in the midst</span> of God's faithful people, then this prophecy was fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">Fear ye not.</span> If God be for us, who can be against us?"
