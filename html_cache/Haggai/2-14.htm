His role is to encourage the rebuilding of the temple, which had been neglected. This response comes after a series of questions posed to the priests about ceremonial cleanliness, highlighting the importance of purity in worship and service to God.<p><b>&#8220;So it is with this people and this nation before Me, declares the LORD</b><br>The phrase "this people and this nation" refers to the returned exiles of Judah. Despite their return to the land, they are still seen as unclean before God due to their neglect of His commands, particularly the rebuilding of the temple. The use of "declares the LORD" emphasizes the divine authority behind Haggai's message, underscoring that it is not merely a human opinion but a divine pronouncement.<p><b>and so it is with every work of their hands;</b><br>The "work of their hands" refers to their daily activities and efforts, including their attempts to rebuild their lives and the temple. The implication is that their efforts are tainted by their spiritual impurity. This echoes the broader biblical theme that without obedience and holiness, human efforts are in vain (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>).<p><b>whatever they offer there is defiled.</b><br>The offerings, likely referring to sacrifices and other religious acts, are considered defiled because they come from impure hearts. This reflects the Old Testament principle that God desires obedience and purity over ritual sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). The defilement of their offerings serves as a reminder of the need for internal transformation and genuine repentance, pointing forward to the ultimate purification through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers the perfect sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haggai.htm">Haggai</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to encourage the Israelites to rebuild the temple after their return from Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The returned exiles who were tasked with rebuilding the temple but had become complacent and focused on their own homes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Haggai to address the spiritual condition of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/defilement.htm">Defilement</a></b><br>The state of being impure or unclean, which in this context refers to the spiritual impurity of the people affecting their offerings and work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_holiness.htm">The Importance of Holiness</a></b><br>God desires purity in our worship and actions.

They who come before the Holy One should themselves be holy. Neither the altar nor the Holy Land imparted sanctity by any intrinsic virtue of their own, but entailed upon all an obligation to personal holiness (Wordsworth).
