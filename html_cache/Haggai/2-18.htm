In the context of Haggai, the prophet calls the people to pay attention to their actions and the consequences that follow. This is a pivotal moment for the Israelites, as they are urged to reflect on their past disobedience and the resulting hardships. The call to "consider" is a recurring theme in Haggai, urging the people to evaluate their spiritual priorities and align them with God's will.<p><b>from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month</b><br>This specific date corresponds to the Jewish calendar, likely falling in late November or early December. It marks a significant point in the rebuilding of the temple, a project that had been delayed due to external opposition and internal apathy. The precision of the date underscores the historical accuracy and the importance of this moment in Israel's history. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the need for the people to respond in obedience.<p><b>the day the foundation of the LORD&#8217;s temple was laid</b><br>The laying of the temple's foundation is a critical event, symbolizing a new beginning for the Israelites. It represents the restoration of worship and the re-establishment of God's presence among His people. The temple is central to Jewish identity and religious life, serving as the place where sacrifices are made and God's glory dwells. This moment also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant with Israel and His promise to dwell among them.<p><b>consider carefully</b><br>The repetition of this phrase reinforces the call to introspection and deliberate action. It serves as a warning and an encouragement to the Israelites to remain faithful and committed to the task of rebuilding the temple. This call to careful consideration is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>, which advises believers to ponder the path of their feet. It highlights the importance of aligning one's actions with God's purposes and being attentive to His guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haggai.htm">Haggai</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to encourage the Israelites to rebuild the temple after their return from Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerubbabel.htm">Zerubbabel</a></b><br>The governor of Judah, a key leader in the rebuilding of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The high priest at the time, working alongside Zerubbabel in the temple reconstruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Judah who returned from exile and were tasked with rebuilding the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_foundation.htm">The Temple Foundation</a></b><br>The physical and spiritual foundation of the temple, symbolizing the renewal of worship and commitment to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reflection.htm">The Importance of Reflection</a></b><br>Haggai urges the people to "consider" their ways and the significance of the day.

The Temple had been founded fifteen years before, in the second month of the second year of Cyrus (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm" title="And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.">Ezra 3:10</a>). The work of building had been carried on intermittently till within two years of the present time. It had then been entirely suspended, and had only been actively taken in hand after Haggai's address in the sixth month of this year. The force of the passage is sufficiently plain if we render as above. "In order to make the blessings to be announced in <a href="/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a> appear in strong contrast to the distress pictured in <a href="/context/haggai/2-16.htm" title="Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the fat press for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.">Haggai 2:16-17</a>, the prophet repeats the injunction of <a href="/haggai/2-15.htm" title="And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of the LORD:">Haggai 2:15</a>, but with a larger range of retrospect. The whole period back to the time when the foundation of the Temple was laid in the reign of Cyrus was more or less one of distress on account of the unfaithfulness of the people; for between that time and the present all the efforts that had been made to complete the work were spasmodic and feeble" (McCurdy). The rendering "even to the day" is quite allowable, though the construction is certainly rare.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">On their obedience the blessings of nature shall again be theirs.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider now from this day and upward</span> (see note on ver. 15.) For "upward" Jerome has here <span class="accented">in futurum</span>, though he translated the same word <span class="accented">supra</span> in ver. 15. Such a rendering is allowable, and affords a good sense, the prophet directing the people's attention to the happy prospect in the future announced in ver. 19.

The prophet bids the people consider the period from the present, <span class="cmt_word">the four and twentieth day of the ninth month</span>, when this prophecy was uttered (ver. 10), to the other limit explanatory of the term "upward" or "backward." <span class="cmt_word">Even from the day that the foundation,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">since the day that</span>, etc. This is obviously the same period as that named in ver. 15, after the foundation was completed, but before "stone was laid upon stone" of the superstructure (comp. <a href="/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/haggai/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Consider carefully</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#238;&#183;m&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
