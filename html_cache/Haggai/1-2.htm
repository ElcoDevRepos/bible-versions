It is a reminder of His authority and ability to accomplish His purposes. This phrase introduces a divine message, underscoring the importance and urgency of the communication. The use of "LORD of Hosts" is frequent in prophetic literature, highlighting God's control over history and His role as a divine warrior (<a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;These people say:</b><br>The phrase "These people" indicates a degree of divine displeasure. Instead of referring to them as "My people," God distances Himself, reflecting their spiritual apathy and disobedience. This echoes the language used in other prophetic books where God addresses Israel's unfaithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, <a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>).<p><b>&#8216;The time has not yet come:</b><br>This reflects the people's procrastination and misplaced priorities. Despite returning from exile and experiencing God's deliverance, they delay rebuilding the temple. Historically, the Jews returned from Babylonian captivity around 538 BC, but by 520 BC, the temple still lay in ruins. This delay contrasts with the urgency God places on His dwelling place, as seen in the construction of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>).<p><b>to rebuild the house of the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and God's presence among His people. The temple's reconstruction was crucial for restoring proper worship and covenant relationship. The people's neglect of the temple symbolizes their spiritual neglect. The temple is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God among men (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The rebuilding of the temple also connects to prophecies of restoration and future glory (<a href="/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haggai.htm">Haggai</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to the people of Judah after their return from Babylonian exile.

It is not stated on what grounds the people based this assumption; but probably they palliated their indifference to religion by a pretended dread of Persian hostility.

that the Persians were adverse to the undertaking; that the unfruitful season rendered them unable to engage in such a great work; and that the very fact of these difficulties existing showed that God did not favour the design. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/haggai/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">that this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1435;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
