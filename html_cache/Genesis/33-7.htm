Leah, as Jacob's first wife, approaches Esau with her children, demonstrating humility and respect. Bowing down is a cultural gesture of submission and honor, common in ancient Near Eastern customs. This act signifies a desire for reconciliation and peace. Leah's children, who are part of the twelve tribes of Israel, represent the future nation of Israel, highlighting the importance of this moment in biblical history.<p><b>and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down</b><br>Joseph, though a child at this time, is significant as he later becomes a central figure in Genesis, foreshadowing his future role in Egypt. Rachel, Jacob's favored wife, approaches last, indicating her special status in Jacob's family. The act of bowing down by Rachel and Joseph also signifies respect and submission, aligning with the cultural practices of the time. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, where Joseph, who later saves his family, prefigures Jesus Christ as the savior of humanity. The order of approach reflects the familial hierarchy and Jacob's affection, with Rachel and Joseph being the most beloved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is the sister of Rachel and mother to several of Jacob's children.
