In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, the father's blessing was a significant and binding act, often seen as prophetic and determinative of the future. Esau's approach to Isaac underscores the importance of the paternal blessing in the cultural and religious context of the time.<p><b>&#8220;Do you have only one blessing, my father?</b><br>Esau's question reveals his desperation and the gravity of the situation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, blessings were not just well-wishes but were believed to carry real power and authority. The singularity of the blessing suggests its unique and irrevocable nature, as seen in the earlier narrative where Jacob deceitfully receives the blessing intended for Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a>). This reflects the belief that once a blessing was given, it could not be retracted or duplicated.<p><b>Bless me too, O my father!&#8221;</b><br>Esau's plea for a blessing, despite the circumstances, shows his deep desire for his father's favor and the benefits that accompany it. This request highlights the emotional and spiritual significance of the blessing, which was not merely about material inheritance but also about identity and destiny. The repetition of "my father" emphasizes the personal relationship and Esau's longing for paternal approval and love.<p><b>Then Esau wept aloud.</b><br>Esau's weeping indicates profound sorrow and loss, marking a pivotal moment in his life. This emotional response is a testament to the weight of the blessing and the consequences of its absence. The weeping also foreshadows the future enmity between Esau's descendants, the Edomites, and Jacob's descendants, the Israelites. In <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16-17</a>, Esau's loss is used as a warning against trading spiritual inheritance for temporary satisfaction, highlighting the enduring spiritual lessons from this narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, known for selling his birthright to his brother Jacob for a meal.

He wants what has been lost, yet without repentance over despising his birthright.<p>- Isaac can grant a secondary word (<a href="/genesis/27-39.htm">Genesis 27:39-40</a>), but it will not reverse God&#8217;s election. Compare Balaam&#8217;s inability to curse Israel when God had determined blessing (<a href="/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>).<p>- The appeal shows that even unbelief can recognize blessing&#8217;s value, echoing those who will say, &#8220;Lord, Lord&#8221; yet never truly knew Him (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Esau wept aloud</b><p>- The loud weeping underlines permanent loss&#8212;similar to later cries in Scripture where repentance is too late, such as the foolish virgins shut out of the wedding feast (<a href="/matthew/25-10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>).<p>- Tears alone are not repentance; Esau&#8217;s sorrow is for consequences, not for sin, matching Paul&#8217;s description of &#8220;worldly grief&#8221; that &#8220;produces death&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p>- His cry nonetheless moves Isaac to speak, illustrating parental compassion even when spiritual realities are fixed (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-38.htm">Genesis 27:38</a> captures Esau&#8217;s anguished realization that the covenant blessing has irrevocably passed to Jacob. His urgent questions, repeated plea, and loud weeping spotlight the cost of earlier contempt for spiritual privilege. The verse warns that opportunities to receive God&#8217;s favor are not endlessly elastic; once His word is spoken, it stands. It urges us to value the blessings found in Christ now, before tears of regret replace the joyful assurance reserved for those who embrace God&#8217;s promises in faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Hast thou but one blessing?</span>--Only one son could inherit the spiritual prerogatives of the birthright, and the temporal lordship which accompanied it.
