He was around 140 years old at this point, emphasizing the longevity of the patriarchs. This age underscores the faithfulness and patience required in his walk with God. The cultural context of the time revered elders, associating age with wisdom and divine favor. Abraham's life journey, from Ur to Canaan, reflects a life of obedience and faith, setting a precedent for future generations. His age also signifies the nearing of the transition of covenantal blessings to the next generation, specifically through Isaac.<p><b>and the LORD had blessed him in every way</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the comprehensive nature of God's blessings upon Abraham. These blessings include material wealth, social status, and spiritual promises. Abraham's wealth is evidenced by his large flocks, herds, and servants, as seen in previous chapters. The blessing also extends to his family, with the birth of Isaac as the child of promise. Spiritually, Abraham is the recipient of the Abrahamic Covenant, which includes the promise of land, descendants, and being a blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This covenant is foundational for the entire biblical narrative, pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ, through whom all nations would indeed be blessed. The phrase reflects God's faithfulness to His promises and sets the stage for the continuation of His plan through Isaac.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

God never hides the realities of aging; He highlights them to show His faithfulness across a lifetime.<p>- Earlier milestones help us feel the weight of this moment: at seventy-five Abraham left Haran (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), at eighty-six Ishmael was born (<a href="/genesis/16-16.htm">Genesis 16:16</a>), at ninety-nine God reaffirmed His covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>).

Abraham&#8217;s gray hairs underline God&#8217;s sustained care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and well along in years</b><p>- The phrase intensifies the first statement. Abraham is not just elderly; he is &#8220;well along,&#8221; past the normal span of strength (cf. <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>).<p>- This detail prepares us for the next events&#8212;finding a wife for Isaac&#8212;not by Abraham&#8217;s vigor but by God&#8217;s provision.<p>- In the broader narrative, God repeatedly works through human weakness: Sarah&#8217;s barrenness (<a href="/genesis/18-11.htm">Genesis 18:11</a>), Moses&#8217; slow speech (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>), Paul&#8217;s thorn (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).
