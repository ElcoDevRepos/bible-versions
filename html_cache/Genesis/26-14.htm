In the ancient Near East, wealth was often measured by the size of one's livestock and the number of servants. This abundance reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac's father, that his descendants would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The accumulation of flocks and herds indicates not only material wealth but also social status and influence. In a pastoral society, such resources were essential for survival and prosperity.<p><b>that the Philistines envied him.</b><br>The Philistines were a significant group in the region, often in conflict with the Israelites. Their envy of Isaac's prosperity suggests a tension between the two groups. This envy can be seen as a precursor to the later conflicts between the Philistines and the Israelites, as seen in the stories of Samson and David. Envy is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to strife and conflict, as seen in the story of Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>) and Joseph and his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>). The Philistines' envy also underscores the idea that God's blessings upon His chosen people can provoke jealousy among others, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the central figure in this passage.
