The act of pulling back the hand signifies a reversal of expectations. In the cultural context of the time, the firstborn son held significant rights and privileges, including a double portion of the inheritance and leadership of the family. The initial emergence of Zerah's hand, marked with a scarlet thread, indicated he would be the firstborn. However, the pulling back of the hand symbolizes a divine intervention that alters human plans, a recurring theme in biblical narratives.<p><b>and his brother came out</b><br>Perez's emergence as the firstborn, despite Zerah's initial appearance, highlights the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing leaders and fulfilling His purposes. This event foreshadows other biblical instances where the younger is chosen over the elder, such as Jacob over Esau and David over his brothers. It underscores the idea that God's plans often defy human expectations and societal norms.<p><b>she said, &#8220;You have broken out first!&#8221;</b><br>Tamar's exclamation acknowledges the surprising turn of events. The phrase "broken out" can be seen as a metaphor for overcoming obstacles or breaking through barriers, which is significant in the context of Perez's lineage. Perez becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ, illustrating how God can bring about His redemptive purposes through unexpected means and people.<p><b>So he was named Perez.</b><br>The name "Perez" means "breach" or "breakthrough," reflecting the circumstances of his birth. Naming in the biblical context often carries prophetic significance, indicating character or destiny. Perez's lineage is crucial in the biblical narrative, as he is listed in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This connection emphasizes the theme of redemption and God's ability to work through flawed human situations to bring about His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/perez.htm">Perez</a></b><br>The son of Tamar and Judah, whose name means "breach" or "breakthrough" in Hebrew.
