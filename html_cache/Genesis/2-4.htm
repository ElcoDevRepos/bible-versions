It serves as a literary marker throughout Genesis, indicating a new narrative or genealogy. The focus here is on the creation of the heavens and the earth, emphasizing the comprehensive scope of God's creative work. This account is distinct from the first chapter of Genesis, which provides a more general overview of creation. The heavens and the earth encompass all of creation, highlighting God's sovereignty over the entire universe.<p><b>when they were created</b><br>The use of the word "created" underscores the divine act of bringing the universe into existence. This aligns with the Hebrew verb "bara," used in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, which is reserved for God's creative activity. It implies an intentional and purposeful act, distinguishing God's creation from any naturalistic or accidental processes. The creation narrative sets the stage for understanding the world as a product of divine will and design, rather than random chance.<p><b>in the day</b><br>The term "day" here is understood as a period of time rather than a literal 24-hour day. In the context of Genesis, "day" can refer to an era or a specific phase in God's creative process. This usage is consistent with other parts of Scripture where "day" signifies a longer period, such as in <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a> and <a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>. The phrase emphasizes the unity and completeness of God's creative work, encapsulating the entire process in a singular divine act.<p><b>that the LORD God made them</b><br>The use of "LORD God" combines the divine names Yahweh (LORD) and Elohim (God), highlighting both the personal and powerful aspects of God's nature. Yahweh is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His relationship with His creation and His people. Elohim, on the other hand, underscores His might and sovereignty. This duality reflects the theological depth of God's character, as both transcendent and immanent. The phrase "made them" reiterates God's active role in creation, affirming His authority and intentionality in forming the heavens and the earth. This sets the foundation for understanding God's ongoing relationship with His creation, as seen throughout the rest of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heavens_and_the_earth.htm">The Heavens and the Earth</a></b><br>Refers to the entirety of creation, emphasizing the scope of God's creative work.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The term "LORD God" combines "Yahweh" (YHWH) and "Elohim," highlighting both the personal and powerful nature of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of God bringing the universe into existence, focusing here on the specific account of the heavens and the earth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority and creator of all things.

Others have supposed that the events recorded in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a> to <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a> took place in the course of twenty-four hours, and suppose that this is proved by what is said in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a>, that the earth and heavens, with Adam and the garden, were all made in one day, before the end of which they suppose that he fell. This view, like that which in Genesis 1 interprets each creative day of a similar period, really amounts to this: that the narrative of Holy Scripture is to be forced to bend to an arbitrary meaning put upon a single word, and drawn not from its meaning in Hebrew, but from its ordinary use in English. More correctly, we might venture to say that the use of the word <span class= "ital">day </span>in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a> is a Divine warning against so wilful a method of exposition. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the generations</span> is the usual heading for the different sections into which the Book of Genesis is divided (vial. <a href="/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10, 27</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-12.htm">Genesis 25:12, 19</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>). Misled by the LXX., who render <span class="accented">toldoth</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, Ranks, Title, Havernick, Tuch, Ewald, and Stahelin disconnect the entire verse from the second section, which says nothing about the origination of the heavens and the earth, and append it to the preceding, in which their creation is described. Ilgen improves on their suggestion by transferring it to the commencement of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, as an appropriate superscription. Dreschler, Vaihingel Bohlen, Oehler, Macdonald, <span class="accented">et alii</span> divide the verse into two clauses, and annex the former to what precedes, commencing the ensuing narrative with the latter. All of these proposals are, however, rendered unnecessary by simply observing that <span class="accented">toldoth</span> (from <span class="accented">yaladh</span>, to bear, to beget; hence begettings, procreations, evolutions, developments) does not describe the antecedents, but the consequents, of either thing or Person (Rosen., Keil, Kalisch). <span class="accented">The toldoth</span> of Noah are not the genealogical list of the patriarch's ancestry, but the tabulated register of his posterity; and so the generations <span class="cmt_word">of the heavens and the earth</span> refer not to their original production (Gesenius), but to their onward movements from creation downwards (Keil). Hence with no incongruity, but with singular propriety, the first half of the present verse, ending with the words <span class="cmt_word">when they were created</span>, literally, <span class="accented">in tier creation</span>, stands at the commencement of the section in which the forward progression of the universe is traced. The point of departure in this subsequent evolution of the material heavens and earth is further specified as being <span class="cmt_word">in the day that the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">made the earth and the heavens</span>; not the heavens and the earth, which would have signified the universe (cf. on Genesis 1:1), and carried hack the writer s thought to the initial act of creation; but the earth and the atmospheric firmament, which indicates the period embracing the second and (possibly) the third creative days as the <span class="accented">terminus aguo</span> of the generations to be forthwith recorded. Then it was that the heavens and the earth in their development took a clear and decided step forward in the direction of man and the human family (was it in the appearance of vegetation?); and in this thought perhaps will be found the key to the significance of the new name for the Divine Being which is used exclusively throughout the present section - <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah Elohim</span>. From the frequency of its use, and the circumstance that it never has the article, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah</span> may be regarded as the proper Personal name of God. Either falsely interpreting <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a> and <a href="/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, or following some ancient superstition (mysterious names of deities were used generally in the East; the Egyptian Hermes had a name which (Cic. 'de Natura Deorum,' 8, 16) durst not be uttered: Furst), the later Hebrews invested this <span class="accented">nomen</span> <span class="accented">tetra</span>. <span class="accented">grammaton</span> with such sanctity that it might not bepronounced (Philo, Vit. <span class="accented">Mosis</span>, 3:519, 529). Accordingly, it was their custom to write it in the sacred text with the vowel points of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, or, if that preceded, Elohim. Hence considerable doubt now exists as to its correct pronunciation. Etymologically viewed it is a future form of <span class="accented">havah</span>, an old form of <span class="accented">hayah</span>; uncertainty as to what future has occasioned many different suggestions as to what constituted its primitive vocalization. According to the evidence which scholars have collected, the choice lies between <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jahveh (Gesenius, Ewald, Reland, Oehler, Macdonald, the Samaritan), <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yehveh or Yeheveh (Furst, W. L. Alexander, in Kitto's 'Cyclopedia'), and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jehovah (Michaelis, Meyer, Stier, Hoelmann, Tregelles, Murphy). Perhaps the preponderance of authority inclines to the first; but the common punctuation is not so indefensible as some writers allege. Gesenius admits that it more satisfactorily accounts for the abbreviated syllables <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> than the pronunciation which he himself favors. Murphy thinks that the substitution of Adonai for Jehovah was facilitated by the agreement of their vowel points. <span class="accented">The locus classicus</span> for its signification is <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, in which God defines himself as "I am that I am," and commands Moses to tell the children of Israel that <span class="accented">Ehyeh</span> had sent him. Hengstenberg and Keil conclude that absolute self-existence is the essential idea represented by the name (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4, 8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">vd</span>. Furst, 'Lex. sub nora.'). Baumgarten and Delitzsch, laying stress on its future form, regard it as = the Becoming One, with reference to the revelation, rather than the essence, of the Divine nature. Macdonald, from the circumstance that it was not used till after the fall, discovers a pointing forward to Jehovah <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in connection with redemption. Others, deriving from a hiphil future, take it as denoting "<span class="accented">he</span> who causes to be, the Fulfiller," and find in this an explanation of <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a> (Exell). May not all these ideas be more or less involved in the fullness of the Divine name? As distinguished from Elohim, <span class="accented">Deus omnipotens</span>, the mighty One, Jehovah is the absolute, self-existent One, who manifests himself to man, and, in particular, enters into distinct covenant engagements for his redemption, which he in due time fulfils. In the present section the names are conjoined partly to identify Jehovah with Elohim, and partly because the subject of which it treats is the history of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] the account</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;wl&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8435.htm">Strong's 8435: </a> </span><span class="str2">Descent, family, history</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the heavens</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
