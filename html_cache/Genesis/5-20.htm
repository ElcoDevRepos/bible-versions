The long lifespans recorded in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, including Jared's 962 years, are often seen as indicative of the pre-Flood world, where conditions may have been different, allowing for extended longevity. This period is characterized by a closer proximity to the original creation, possibly resulting in fewer genetic mutations and a more pristine environment. Jared's lifespan is the second longest recorded in the Bible, after Methuselah, which underscores the antediluvian era's unique characteristics. Theologically, these long lifespans can be seen as a testament to God's original design for humanity, which was intended for eternal life before the fall. <p><b>and then he died</b><br>The phrase "and then he died" is a recurring refrain in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, emphasizing the reality of death as a consequence of sin, as introduced in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. Despite the long lifespans, the inevitability of death underscores the fulfillment of God's warning to Adam and Eve that death would result from disobedience. This phrase serves as a somber reminder of the fallen state of humanity and the need for redemption. In the broader biblical narrative, it points forward to the hope of resurrection and eternal life through Jesus Christ, who conquers death.
