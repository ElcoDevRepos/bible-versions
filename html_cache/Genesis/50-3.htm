The forty days mentioned here align with historical records of Egyptian mummification practices, which typically took around 40 days to complete. This period was necessary for the drying and preservation of the body using natron, a naturally occurring salt. The number forty is also significant in biblical terms, often symbolizing a period of testing or completion, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</b><br>The seventy days of mourning reflect the high regard in which Joseph was held in Egypt. This period of mourning was customary for Egyptian royalty, indicating Joseph's elevated status. The number seventy is significant in the Bible, often representing completeness or a full measure, as seen in the seventy elders of Israel (<a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>) and the seventy years of Babylonian captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). This extended mourning period underscores the deep respect and affection the Egyptians had for Joseph, who had saved them from famine and served as a powerful leader. It also foreshadows the eventual mourning for Jesus Christ, who, like Joseph, was a savior to his people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt.

That span matches the standard Egyptian practice; mummification normally lasted about 40 days, after which the body was ready for wrapping and placement in the coffin (<a href="/genesis/50-26.htm">Genesis 50:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Forty is often a period of preparation or completion in Scripture&#8212;rain during the Flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Moses on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). Here it marks the complete, orderly care given to Jacob&#8217;s body, underscoring Joseph&#8217;s respect for his father and God&#8217;s providence over every detail of Jacob&#8217;s promised return to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s involvement echoes the later attention given to Jesus&#8217; body (<a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-40</a>); both receive honor despite being far from their ultimate resting places at the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Required to complete the embalming</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights that this was not a hasty effort but the full, recognized procedure. Joseph employs &#8220;the physicians in his service&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-2.htm">Genesis 50:2</a>), not pagan priests, showing he honors Egyptian expertise without compromising faith.<p>&#8226; The thorough treatment fulfills Jacob&#8217;s earlier request not to be buried in Egypt but in the cave of Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-32</a>). Preservation ensured safe transport&#8212;foreshadowing Israel&#8217;s own preservation until the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The care points to the dignity of the human body as God&#8217;s creation (<a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>) and anticipates resurrection hope (<a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days</b><p>&#8226; Seventy nearly equals the 72-day state mourning observed for a Pharaoh. The nation&#8217;s grief shows how highly Jacob&#8212;and by extension Joseph&#8212;was esteemed (<a href="/genesis/47-5.htm">Genesis 47:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Public lament signals God&#8217;s promise to make Abraham&#8217;s offspring a blessing to the nations being tasted already (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). Even a pagan culture pauses to honor the patriarch through whom famine relief had come (<a href="/genesis/41-53.htm">Genesis 41:53-57</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare shorter biblical mourning periods: thirty days for Aaron (<a href="/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>) and Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>). The longer Egyptian period magnifies Jacob&#8217;s adopted royal stature while he never relinquishes his pilgrim identity (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; This nationwide sorrow sets the stage for Israel&#8217;s later affliction when &#8220;a new king arose who did not know Joseph&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>). God&#8217;s people move from favor to bondage, yet both circumstances rest under His sovereign timing (<a href="/acts/7-17.htm">Acts 7:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/50-3.htm">Genesis 50:3</a> records more than funeral details; it testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness. Forty days of careful embalming fulfilled Egyptian custom and preserved Jacob for burial in the promised land. Seventy days of national mourning proclaimed the honor God granted His servant and previewed Israel&#8217;s influence in the world. The verse reassures believers that in life, death, and every transition, the Lord directs events exactly, keeping every promise to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Forty days.</span>--Herodotus (ii. 86) describes the process of embalming as occupying seventy days, but he was speaking of what he saw at Thebes, whereas Memphis was the Egyptian capital in Joseph's time; and the mummies of Thebes are, we are told, far more perfectly preserved than those of Memphis. Diodorus agrees very nearly with the periods mentioned here, saying (i. 91) that the embalming took somewhat more than thirty days, and the mourning for a king seventy-two. The usual period of mourning among the Israelites was thirty days (<a href="/numbers/20-29.htm" title="And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.">Numbers 20:29</a> : <a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm" title="And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>). Probably, therefore, the forty days spent in the embalming were included in the "threescore and ten days," during which the Egyptians mourned for Jacob.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned</span> (literally, <span class="accented">wept</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for him threescore and ten days</span> - i.e. the whole period of mourning, including the forty days for embalming, extended to seventy days, a statement which strikingly coincides with the assertion of Diodorus Siculus (1:72), that the embalming process occupied about thirty days, while the mourning continued seventy-two days; the first number, seventy, being seven decades, or ten weeks of seven days, and the second 12 x 6 = 72, the duodecimal calculation being also used in Egypt (<span class="accented">vide</span> Wilkinson in Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 121; and in ' Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians: vol. 3. p. 471, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>, ed. 1878). The apparent discrepancy between the accounts of Genesis and Herodotus will disappear if the seventy days of the Greek historian, during which the body lay in antrum, be viewed as the entire period of mourning (Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 68; Sir G.
