Bread was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and life. Abraham's offer reflects his generosity and respect for his guests, who are later revealed to be divine messengers. This act of hospitality is reminiscent of Jesus' feeding of the multitudes, where bread also plays a central role (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<p><b>so that you may refresh yourselves.</b><br>The concept of refreshment here implies physical nourishment and rest, which were essential for travelers in the harsh desert environment. This phrase can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual refreshment, akin to Jesus' invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."<p><b>This is why you have passed your servant&#8217;s way.</b><br>Abraham acknowledges the providential nature of the encounter, seeing it as an opportunity to serve. This reflects a biblical theme where God orchestrates events for His purposes, as seen in Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where what was meant for evil, God used for good.<p><b>After that, you may continue on your way.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates Abraham's respect for his guests' journey and mission. It underscores the transient nature of their visit, which parallels the transient nature of life and the Christian journey towards a heavenly home, as described in <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;you may do as you have said.&#8221;</b><br>The guests' agreement signifies acceptance of Abraham's hospitality, which is a significant moment of divine-human interaction. This acceptance can be seen as a foreshadowing of God's acceptance of human offerings and worship, as long as they are given with a sincere heart, similar to the widow's offering in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
