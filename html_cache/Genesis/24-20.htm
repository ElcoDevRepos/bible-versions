In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, hospitality was a highly valued virtue. Rebekah's actions demonstrate her willingness to serve and her industrious nature. The trough was a common feature in ancient wells, designed to hold water for animals. This act of emptying her jar quickly suggests her efficiency and readiness to help, reflecting the qualities that would make her a suitable wife for Isaac.<p><b>and ran back to the well to draw water</b><br>Rebekah's running indicates her enthusiasm and commitment to the task. Wells were central to community life in ancient times, often located outside the city gates. Drawing water was typically a woman's task, and it required physical strength and endurance. Her repeated trips to the well show her dedication and strength, qualities that are commendable and align with the <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a> description of a virtuous woman.<p><b>until she had drawn water for all his camels</b><br>Camels are known to drink large quantities of water, especially after a long journey. A single camel can drink up to 20-30 gallons of water. Abraham's servant had ten camels, indicating that Rebekah's task was not only labor-intensive but also time-consuming. This detail underscores her generosity and willingness to go above and beyond what was expected. Her actions can be seen as a foreshadowing of the abundant blessings that would come through her lineage, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, who offers living water to all (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A young woman of great character and hospitality, Rebekah is the daughter of Bethuel and becomes the wife of Isaac.
