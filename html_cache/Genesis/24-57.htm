In the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern societies, family decisions were often made collectively, reflecting the patriarchal and communal nature of the society. This decision-making process underscores the importance of family consent in marriage arrangements.<p><b>&#8220;We will call the girl</b><br>The term "girl" refers to Rebekah, who is the central female figure in this narrative. In the historical context, women were often not consulted in marriage decisions, making this instance notable. It highlights a moment of agency for Rebekah, which is significant given the patriarchal norms of the time. This also foreshadows Rebekah's future role as a matriarch in the lineage of Israel.<p><b>and ask her opinion.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is significant as it shows respect for Rebekah's personal choice, which is somewhat atypical for the era. It reflects a level of respect and consideration for her will, aligning with the biblical theme of free will and personal agency. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, where the invitation to follow God's will is extended, but the response is left to individual choice. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God often invites individuals to participate in His plans, respecting their freedom to choose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>- A young woman from the family of Bethuel, chosen to be Isaac's wife.

Their words here show a willingness to cooperate with what they have recognized as God&#8217;s plan, echoing earlier patriarchal decisions that yielded to divine direction (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>; 22:12).<p>&#8226; Their agreement follows the servant&#8217;s insistence on leaving immediately (24:56). It highlights how God&#8217;s purposes often move past human hesitation, as seen with Moses&#8217; family releasing him for service (<a href="/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18</a>) and Elisha promptly following Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-20.htm">1 Kings 19:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; By speaking together, the family models unity&#8212;a recurring biblical ideal (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>; <a href="/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will call the girl</b><p>&#8220;We will call the girl&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-57.htm">Genesis 24:57</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Call&#8221; implies summoning Rebekah into the decision. Scripture frequently places God&#8217;s call alongside human response (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing the girl by name yet referring to her as &#8220;the girl&#8221; underscores her youth but not insignificance. God consistently elevates the seemingly small (<a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Inviting her presence reflects respect for her personhood within family authority. Similar moments appear when David is sent for before anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>) and when Esther is summoned before the king&#8217;s court (<a href="/esther/2-14.htm">Esther 2:14&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ask her opinion</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and ask her opinion.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-57.htm">Genesis 24:57</a>)<p>&#8226; Seeking Rebekah&#8217;s consent aligns with the biblical picture of marriage as covenant, not coercion (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Her forthcoming answer, &#8220;I will go&#8221; (24:58), mirrors the faith-filled responses of Abraham (12:4) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>), showing that obedience springs from willing hearts.<p>&#8226; The family&#8217;s approach honors the dignity of choice, foreshadowing New Covenant calls to voluntary faith (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By valuing her voice, Scripture underscores that God works through individual decisions, weaving them into His sovereign plan (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-57.htm">Genesis 24:57</a> reveals a family that, having acknowledged God&#8217;s leading, now invites Rebekah&#8217;s own participation.
