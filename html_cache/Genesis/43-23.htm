In the broader narrative, this moment foreshadows the eventual reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers. The steward, likely an Egyptian, speaks words of peace, which is significant given the brothers' fear of retribution. This phrase highlights the theme of divine providence and the unfolding of God's plan, even through foreign intermediaries.<p><b>&#8220;Do not be afraid.&#8221;</b><br>Fear is a recurring theme in the story of Joseph and his brothers. The brothers are anxious about their previous encounter in Egypt and the money found in their sacks. The steward's words echo God's frequent reassurance to His people throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God tells Israel not to fear because He is with them. This phrase serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen people.<p><b>&#8220;Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure that was in your sacks.&#8221;</b><br>The steward acknowledges the God of the Hebrews, which is significant in a polytheistic Egyptian context. This acknowledgment suggests Joseph's influence in his household and possibly his witness to the Egyptians. The reference to "the God of your father" connects the brothers to the covenantal promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing God's faithfulness across generations. The treasure in the sacks symbolizes God's provision and blessing, reminiscent of the Israelites' future experiences of divine provision, such as manna in the wilderness.<p><b>&#8220;I received your silver.&#8221;</b><br>This statement clarifies that the return of the silver was intentional and not an oversight. It underscores the theme of integrity and justice, as Joseph ensures that his brothers are not wrongfully accused of theft. The silver, a recurring element in Joseph's story, also alludes to the price for which Joseph was sold into slavery, drawing a parallel between past injustices and present redemption.<p><b>Then he brought Simeon out to them.</b><br>Simeon's release is a pivotal moment, symbolizing the beginning of restoration and reconciliation within the family. Simeon had been held as a guarantee for the brothers' return with Benjamin, highlighting the themes of sacrifice and redemption. This act prefigures the ultimate reconciliation that will occur when Joseph reveals his identity. Simeon's release can also be seen as a type of Christ, who liberates those bound by sin and restores them to fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_steward.htm">The Steward</a></b><br>An Egyptian servant in charge of Joseph's household, who reassures Joseph's brothers about the silver in their sacks.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who are returning to Egypt with Benjamin to buy more grain and are concerned about the silver found in their sacks.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>One of Joseph's brothers who was held in Egypt as a guarantee for the return of the others with Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph has risen to power and where his brothers have come to buy grain during the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_your_father.htm">God of your father</a></b><br>Refers to the God of Jacob, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant and faithfulness to the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in the events of our lives, even when we do not understand them.

His calm assurance signals that no punishment is coming, countering their dread from <a href="/genesis/43-18.htm">Genesis 43:18</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses a simple word of wellness to settle troubled hearts. In <a href="/2_kings/4-26.htm">2 Kings 4:26</a> Elisha tells Gehazi to ask, &#8220;Are you well?&#8221;&#8212;the same Hebrew idea of &#8220;shalom,&#8221; a wholeness only God secures (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s household servant, though Egyptian, becomes the mouthpiece of peace. God can use anyone&#8212;even those outside the covenant line&#8212;to announce His favor (<a href="/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>; <a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Do not be afraid.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Fear dominated the brothers since they first found their silver returned (<a href="/genesis/42-28.htm">Genesis 42:28</a>). The steward&#8217;s words echo God&#8217;s recurring command to His people: &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, all).<p>&#8226; This assurance reaches beyond the steward&#8217;s authority; it points to God&#8217;s own character. When the Lord speaks peace, His people can rest, even when circumstances remain unclear (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure that was in your sacks.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The steward attributes the mysterious silver to &#8220;your God,&#8221; acknowledging the covenant name and lineage (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>; 31:42; 48:15). Joseph has evidently testified about his God within the household (<a href="/genesis/39-3.htm">Genesis 39:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling the money a &#8220;treasure,&#8221; he reframes what the brothers saw as incriminating evidence into a gracious gift. <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> reminds us that &#8220;every good and perfect gift is from above.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase connects generations&#8212;&#8220;the God of your father&#8221;&#8212;underscoring that the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness spans family lines (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I received your silver.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Literally, the steward says he &#8220;came to have&#8221; their payment. Joseph had paid it himself (<a href="/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>). From the brothers&#8217; perspective, the debt is settled.<p>&#8226; This points to substitutionary grace: someone else covers the cost, though the recipients did nothing to earn it (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s strategy also tests their honesty (<a href="/genesis/44-1.htm">Genesis 44:1-2</a>). The brothers must face truth without bribery or manipulation, trusting God&#8217;s providence instead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he brought Simeon out to them.</b><p>&#8226; Simeon&#8217;s release proves the steward&#8217;s words and Joseph&#8217;s goodwill (<a href="/genesis/42-24.htm">Genesis 42:24</a>). Physical liberation follows verbal assurance&#8212;faith becomes sight (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows a greater Deliverer who frees captives (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).

An Egyptian steward calms fearful hearts, credits God for unexpected provision, confirms that all debt is paid, and restores the captive brother. The verse teaches that the Lord&#8217;s peace displaces fear, His gifts cancel debt, and His faithfulness spans generations, preparing the way for reconciliation long before it is fully realized.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Your God . . . --</span>Either Joseph had instructed his steward what to say, or he had trained his household generally in the truths of his religion.
