Sarah, who had been barren for many years, now experiences the joy of motherhood. Her words reflect a personal testimony of God's faithfulness. In the broader biblical narrative, Sarah's voice here is important as it highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant promise to Abraham, which is central to the unfolding story of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;God has made me laugh,</b><br>The laughter here is one of joy and amazement, contrasting with Sarah's earlier laughter of doubt in <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a> when she first heard the promise of a son. This transformation from doubt to joy underscores the theme of God's power to bring about the impossible. The name Isaac, which means "he laughs," is a direct reflection of this moment, symbolizing the joy and fulfillment of God's promise. This laughter can also be seen as a type of the joy that comes with the fulfillment of God's promises in Christ, who brings ultimate joy and salvation.<p><b>and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.&#8221;</b><br>Sarah anticipates that her joy will be shared by others, indicating the communal nature of God's blessings. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God's work in the lives of individuals often has implications for the community. The laughter of others can be seen as a recognition of God's miraculous intervention. This communal joy prefigures the joy of the nations in the New Testament, where the good news of Jesus Christ is shared and celebrated by all who hear it. The laughter also serves as a testimony to God's faithfulness and power, encouraging others to trust in His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac.

Joy was uppermost in her mind, but women do not laugh for joy at the birth of a child. Doubtless she called to mind the feelings with which she listened to the announcement of her bearing a son, made by those whom she then regarded as mere passing wayfarers (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>), but whom she had now long known to be the messengers of God.

Deeper feelings would come afterwards, and the acknowledgment that that which was contrary to nature was wrought by Him whom nature must obey; but surprise is uppermost in the little poem in which Sarah gives utterance to her first feelings:--<p>Who would have said unto Abraham<p>Sarah suckleth sons?<p>For I have borne a son to his old age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarah said,</span> - the spiritual elevation of her soul being indicated by the poetical form of her speech.
