Shechem, a Hivite prince, approaches his father, Hamor, indicating the patriarchal structure of the society. This reflects the cultural norm where family heads played a crucial role in arranging marriages. The Hivites were one of the Canaanite tribes, and their interactions with the Israelites are significant throughout the Old Testament. The involvement of Hamor suggests a formal and serious intention, as marriage alliances were often used to strengthen political and social ties.<p><b>&#8220;Get me this girl as a wife.&#8221;</b><br>Shechem's demand reflects a sense of entitlement and urgency, which is consistent with his previous actions in the narrative. The phrase "get me" indicates a lack of respect for Dinah's autonomy, highlighting the patriarchal and transactional nature of marriages at the time. This request follows Shechem's violation of Dinah, which adds a layer of complexity and tension to the narrative. The term "girl" underscores Dinah's youth and vulnerability. This situation sets the stage for the subsequent conflict between the sons of Jacob and the people of Shechem, illustrating the broader theme of familial honor and retribution. The request for marriage after such an act also reflects the cultural practices where marriage could be seen as a means to rectify or legitimize a prior wrongdoing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The son of Hamor, a Hivite prince, who desires to marry Dinah after defiling her.
