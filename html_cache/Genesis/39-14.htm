Potiphar's wife calling the servants indicates her attempt to gather witnesses to support her false accusation against Joseph. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient societies where servants were often privy to the private affairs of their masters. The presence of servants also highlights the social dynamics and power imbalances within the household.<p><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221; she said</b><br>The use of "Look" serves as an attention-grabbing device, emphasizing the urgency and seriousness of her claim. It suggests an attempt to manipulate the perception of the servants by framing the situation dramatically. This aligns with the narrative technique of using direct speech to convey immediacy and emotional intensity.<p><b>&#8220;this Hebrew has been brought to us</b><br>Referring to Joseph as "this Hebrew" underscores his outsider status in Egyptian society. The term "Hebrew" is often used in the Old Testament to denote a foreigner or someone from the lineage of Eber, an ancestor of Abraham. This highlights the ethnic and cultural tensions present in the narrative, as Joseph's identity is used against him. It also foreshadows the broader theme of Israel's eventual enslavement in Egypt.<p><b>to make sport of us</b><br>The phrase "to make sport of us" implies mockery or humiliation. Potiphar's wife accuses Joseph of intending to demean or ridicule the household, which is a serious charge in a culture that valued honor and reputation. This accusation is a strategic move to portray Joseph as a threat to the social order and to justify her actions against him.<p><b>He came to me so he could sleep with me</b><br>This false accusation of attempted rape is a pivotal moment in the narrative. It reflects the recurring biblical theme of sexual temptation and integrity, as seen in other stories such as David and Bathsheba. Joseph's resistance to Potiphar's wife is a testament to his moral character and fear of God, contrasting with the deceit and manipulation of Potiphar's wife.<p><b>but I screamed as loud as I could</b><br>The claim of screaming is intended to provide evidence of resistance and to paint Joseph as the aggressor. In ancient legal contexts, a woman's scream could be used as a defense to prove non-consent. This detail is crucial for Potiphar's wife to establish her innocence and to shift the blame onto Joseph. It also serves to heighten the drama and tension in the narrative, setting the stage for Joseph's unjust imprisonment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, known for his integrity and faithfulness to God.
