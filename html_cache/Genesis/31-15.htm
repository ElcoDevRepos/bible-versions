This sentiment reflects the broader theme of familial estrangement found throughout Genesis, such as the separation between Isaac and Ishmael or Jacob and Esau. Culturally, daughters were often seen as part of their father's household until marriage, but here, they feel like strangers. This phrase highlights the tension between Laban and his daughters, which is a microcosm of the larger conflict between Laban and Jacob. The idea of being regarded as outsiders can also be seen in the New Testament, where believers are described as aliens and strangers in the world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<p><b>Not only has he sold us,</b><br>This phrase refers to the ancient Near Eastern practice of dowry, where a bride price was paid by the groom to the bride's family. Rachel and Leah feel as though their father has treated them as commodities rather than family members. This reflects the transactional nature of many marriages in the ancient world, where women often had little say in their marital arrangements. The selling of daughters can be contrasted with the New Testament depiction of the Church as the Bride of Christ, where the relationship is based on love and sacrifice rather than transaction (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>but he has certainly squandered what was paid for us.</b><br>Laban's misuse of the bride price indicates his lack of integrity and poor stewardship. In biblical terms, stewardship is a significant theme, with parables such as the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>) emphasizing the importance of managing resources wisely. Laban's squandering of the bride price can be seen as a failure to honor his obligations to his daughters, contrasting with God's faithfulness and provision. This misuse of resources also foreshadows the eventual departure of Jacob and his family from Laban's household, as God calls them to return to the Promised Land, a place of divine provision and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel_and_leah.htm">Rachel and Leah</a></b><br>The daughters of Laban, who express their feelings of being treated as outsiders by their father.
