In the context of Genesis, it suggests a group distinct from humans, possibly fallen angels. This interpretation is supported by <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> and <a href="/job/2.htm">Job 2:1</a>, where "sons of God" clearly refers to angelic beings. Some conservative scholars also consider the "sons of God" to be the godly lineage of Seth, contrasting with the ungodly line of Cain.<p><b>saw that the daughters of men</b><br>The "daughters of men" are generally understood to be human women, specifically from the lineage of Cain. This phrase highlights the interaction between the divine or semi-divine beings and human beings, which was contrary to God's intended order. The emphasis on "saw" suggests a visual attraction, which is a recurring theme in the Bible where sight leads to temptation and sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a> with Eve.<p><b>were beautiful</b><br>The beauty of the daughters of men is noted as a significant factor in the sons of God's decision to take them as wives. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where physical beauty can lead to moral and spiritual compromise, as seen in the stories of Samson and Delilah (Judges 16) and David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11). The focus on physical appearance rather than spiritual qualities often leads to negative consequences.<p><b>and they took as wives</b><br>This phrase indicates a formal union, suggesting that these were not mere acts of lust but involved marriage. However, the marriages were not sanctioned by God, as they were unions between beings of different natures. This act of taking wives parallels the later Israelite warnings against intermarriage with pagan nations, which could lead to idolatry and turning away from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p><b>whomever they chose</b><br>The phrase implies a disregard for divine guidance or moral considerations, highlighting the autonomy and rebellion of the "sons of God." This choice reflects a self-centered decision-making process, similar to the autonomy exercised by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. It underscores the theme of human (or semi-divine) rebellion against God's established order, which is a precursor to the judgment that follows in the narrative of the Flood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_god.htm">Sons of God</a></b><br>This term has been interpreted in various ways, including as angels, descendants of Seth, or rulers.

St. Jude, <a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>, and St. Peter, 2 Ep., <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>, seem to favour this interpretation, possibly as being the translation of the LXX. according to several MSS. But even if this be their meaning, which is very uncertain, they use it only as an illustration; and a higher authority says that the angels neither marry nor are given in marriage. The third, and most generally accepted interpretation in modern times, is that the sons of the Elohim were the Sethites, and that when they married for mere lust of beauty, universal corruption soon ensued. But no modern commentator has shown how such marriages could produce "mighty men . . . men of renown;" or how strong warriors could be the result of the intermarriage of pious men with women of an inferior race, such as the Cainites are assumed to have been.<p>The Jewish interpreters, who well understood the uses of their own language, are right in the main point that the phrase "sons of the Elohim" conveys no idea of moral goodness or piety.
