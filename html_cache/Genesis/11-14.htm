The age of 30 is significant in biblical terms, often representing maturity and readiness for responsibility. This age is also seen in the lives of other biblical figures, such as Joseph, who began his service to Pharaoh at 30, and David, who became king at 30. The mention of age underscores the importance of lineage and the continuation of God's covenant promises through specific family lines.<p><b>he became the father of Eber</b><br>Eber is an important figure as he is considered the ancestor of the Hebrews. The name "Eber" is etymologically linked to the term "Hebrew," suggesting a connection to the identity of the Israelite people. This genealogical note highlights the continuity of God's plan through specific individuals and families.
