Joseph, now a powerful figure in Egypt, is addressing his brothers who do not recognize him. The term "servants" reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where those in power often referred to others in subservient terms. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Joseph tests his brothers' integrity and repentance.<p><b>&#8216;Unless your younger brother comes down with you,</b><br>Joseph's demand for Benjamin to come to Egypt is a test of his brothers' honesty and familial loyalty. Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, holds a special place in Jacob's heart, especially after the presumed loss of Joseph. This request is significant as it forces the brothers to confront their past actions against Joseph. The geographical reference to "coming down" indicates the journey from Canaan to Egypt, which is southward and downhill.<p><b>you will not see my face again.&#8217;</b><br>In ancient cultures, seeing someone's face, especially a ruler's, was a sign of favor and acceptance. Joseph's statement underscores the seriousness of his demand and the potential consequences of non-compliance. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and revelation of Joseph's identity. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of Christ, where seeing the face of God is contingent upon reconciliation and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah plays a significant role in this chapter as he pleads with Joseph for the release of Benjamin.

Joseph&#8217;s threat therefore equates refusal with starvation and banishment.<p>- The phrase prefigures the ultimate judgment theme: without fulfilling God&#8217;s conditions, one is barred from His presence (<a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p>- By agreeing to the demand, Judah and his brothers reveal a changed heart, willing to stand in the gap for Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/43-8.htm">Genesis 43:8-9</a>; 44:33-34), mirroring the substitutionary role later seen in Christ&#8217;s sacrifice (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>; <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-23.htm">Genesis 44:23</a> captures Joseph&#8217;s non-negotiable command that Benjamin must appear, a test crafted to expose his brothers&#8217; repentance and protect their family. The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s word is fixed, obedience proves sincerity, and access to His presence hinges on meeting the conditions He establishes&#8212;ultimately pointing to the One who fulfills those conditions on our behalf.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But you said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
