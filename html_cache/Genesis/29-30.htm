In the cultural context of the time, marriage was often solidified through physical union. Jacob's desire to marry Rachel was initially thwarted by Laban's deception, which led to Leah becoming his first wife. This act of sleeping with Rachel signifies the fulfillment of Jacob's original intent to marry her, highlighting the importance of love and personal choice in marriage, even within the constraints of ancient customs.<p><b>and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah</b><br>Jacob's preferential love for Rachel over Leah is a recurring theme in the narrative. This favoritism sets the stage for familial tensions and rivalries, particularly between the sisters and later among their children. The Bible often records the consequences of favoritism, as seen in the stories of Joseph and his brothers. This preference also reflects the human tendency to value personal attraction and emotional connection, which can lead to discord when not balanced with fairness and compassion.<p><b>So he worked for Laban another seven years</b><br>Jacob's additional seven years of labor for Laban underscores the theme of perseverance and commitment. Despite being deceived, Jacob honors his agreement, demonstrating integrity and patience. This period of service can be seen as a time of character development for Jacob, who himself had previously deceived his brother Esau. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting that this extended period was part of God's plan to refine Jacob. This also foreshadows the Israelites' later servitude in Egypt and their eventual deliverance, drawing a parallel between Jacob's personal journey and the larger narrative of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob is a central patriarch in the biblical account.
