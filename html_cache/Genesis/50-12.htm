It reflects the importance of honoring one's parents, a principle deeply rooted in the cultural and religious practices of the time. This act of obedience is consistent with the commandment later given in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, "Honor your father and your mother." The sons' actions also demonstrate unity among the brothers, which contrasts with their earlier discord, such as the selling of Joseph into slavery.<p><b>as he had charged them.</b><br>Jacob's charge to his sons was to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, which he had purchased as a burial site for his family (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-32</a>). This cave is located in Hebron, in the land of Canaan, and holds significant ancestral importance as the burial place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah. The fulfillment of Jacob's request underscores the importance of burial customs and the connection to the Promised Land, which God had sworn to give to Abraham and his descendants. This act of fulfilling Jacob's charge can be seen as a type of Christ, who also fulfilled the will of His Father, as seen in <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, "For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, Jacob is the father of the twelve sons who become the leaders of the twelve tribes of Israel.
