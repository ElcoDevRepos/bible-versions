The use of "completed" indicates that nothing was left unfinished, reflecting God's omnipotence and intentionality. This completion is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus declares, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), signifying the completion of His redemptive work. The heavens and the earth encompass all of creation, highlighting the scope of God's creative power. The phrase also sets the stage for the Sabbath rest, which follows in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, underscoring the importance of rest and reflection after work.<p><b>in all their vast array.</b><br>The term "vast array" suggests the complexity and diversity of creation, from the celestial bodies to the myriad forms of life on earth. This phrase invites reflection on the order and beauty inherent in creation, which is a testament to God's wisdom and creativity. The "vast array" can also be seen as a precursor to the diversity within the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where each part has a unique role and purpose. The phrase underscores the interconnectedness of all creation, which is a theme that runs throughout the Bible, reminding believers of their responsibility to steward the earth wisely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_earth.htm">Heavens and Earth</a></b><br>Refers to the entire universe created by God.

For the great object of this hymn of creation is to give the sanction of the Creator to the Sabbath. Hence the ascribing of rest to Him who wearies not, and hence also the description of the several stages of creation as days. Labour is, no doubt, ennobled by creation being described as work done by God; but the higher purpose of this Scripture was that for which appeal is made to it in the Fourth Commandment, namely, to ennoble man's weekly rest. Among the Accadians, Mr. Sayce says (<span class= "ital">Chald. Genesis. </span>p. 89), the Sabbath was observed--so ancient is its institution--but it was connected with the sun, moon, and five planets, whence even now the days of the week take their titles, though the names of Scandinavian deities have been substituted in this country for some of their old Latin appellations. Here every idolatrous tendency is guarded against, and the Sabbath is the institution of the One Almighty God.<p><span class= "bld">The host of them.</span>--The word translated <span class= "ital">host </span>does not refer to military arrangement, but to numbers gathered in crowds. This crowded throng of heaven sometimes means the angels, as in <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19</a>; oftener the stars. Here it is the host both of heaven and earth, and signifies the multitudes of living creatures which people the land, and seas, and air.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished.</span> Literally, and finished were the heavens and the earth, the emphatic position being occupied by the verb. With the creation of man upon the sixth day the Divine Artificer's labors were brought to a termination, and his work to a completion. The two ideas of cessation and perfection are embraced in the import of <span class="accented">calais</span>. Not simply had Elohim paused in his activity, but the Divine idea of his universe had been realized. The finished world was a cosmos, arranged, ornamented, and filled with organized, sentient, and rational beings, with plants, animals, and man; and now the resplendent fabric shone before him a magnificent success - "lo! very good."
