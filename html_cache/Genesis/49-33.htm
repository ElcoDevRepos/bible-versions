This moment is significant as it sets the stage for the future of the nation of Israel. The blessings and prophecies reflect the character and future of each tribe. This act of blessing is a common patriarchal practice, seen also with Isaac blessing Jacob and Esau. It underscores the importance of the spoken word and the belief in its power to shape destiny.<p><b>he pulled his feet into the bed</b><br>This phrase indicates Jacob's readiness for death. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the act of gathering one's feet into the bed symbolizes a peaceful acceptance of death. It reflects a sense of completion and readiness to depart from this life. Jacob's actions here are deliberate and dignified, showing his control over his final moments, a privilege often associated with the righteous.<p><b>and breathed his last</b><br>Jacob's death marks the end of an era for the patriarchs. His passing is significant as it transitions the narrative from the patriarchal stories to the formation of the nation of Israel. The phrase "breathed his last" is a common biblical expression for death, emphasizing the cessation of life and the return of the spirit to God, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>.<p><b>and he was gathered to his people</b><br>This phrase suggests a belief in an afterlife or a continued existence with one's ancestors. It implies a reunion with those who have gone before, such as Abraham and Isaac. This expression is used throughout the Old Testament to denote death, indicating a cultural understanding of death as a gathering or joining with one's forebears. It reflects the hope of continuity and community beyond death, a theme that resonates with the Christian hope of eternal life and reunion with the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the patriarch of the twelve tribes of Israel.
