In Egyptian culture, dreams were often seen as omens or communications from the gods, and a troubled spirit indicated a need for interpretation.

This sets the stage for Joseph, who relies on God for interpretation, contrasting the wisdom of Egypt with the wisdom of God.<p><b>Pharaoh told them his dreams</b><br>Pharaoh's willingness to share his dreams with his advisors underscores the urgency and importance he placed on understanding them. Dreams were considered significant in Egyptian culture, often influencing decisions and policies.

So, too, the "wise men" were men educated and trained, but probably the profession of magic, of divination, and astrology was that which gained for them wealth and honour, and not the possession of whatever real science existed at that time in Egypt.
