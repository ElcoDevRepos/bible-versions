This reflects Jacob's desire to ensure that his relationship with Esau is fully restored. The use of "please" indicates humility and earnestness in his approach.<p><b>If I have found favor in your sight,</b><br>This phrase echoes the language of seeking grace or favor, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. It reflects Jacob's hope that his actions and offerings will be accepted by Esau, similar to how individuals seek favor from God. This mirrors the language used in <a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>, where Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.<p><b>then receive this gift from my hand.</b><br>The act of giving a gift was a significant gesture in ancient times, often symbolizing the desire for peace and goodwill. Jacob's offering can be seen as a peace offering, reminiscent of the sacrificial system where offerings were made to atone and reconcile. This act also prefigures the ultimate gift of reconciliation through Jesus Christ.<p><b>For indeed, I have seen your face,</b><br>Seeing someone's face in biblical terms often implies a personal encounter or relationship. Jacob's statement can be compared to the priestly blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the Lord's face shining upon someone signifies blessing and favor. This encounter with Esau is a pivotal moment of reconciliation for Jacob.<p><b>and it is like seeing the face of God,</b><br>Jacob's comparison of Esau's face to the face of God is profound, suggesting that the reconciliation with his brother is a divine experience. This can be linked to Jacob's earlier encounter with God at Peniel (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>), where he saw God face to face. It underscores the theme of divine intervention and blessing in human relationships.<p><b>since you have received me favorably.</b><br>The favorable reception by Esau is a testament to the transformation in their relationship, which can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and bless Jacob. This acceptance is a type of the grace believers receive through Christ, who reconciles humanity to God. The theme of reconciliation is central to the gospel message, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who wrestled with God and was renamed Israel.

The passage teaches that genuine repentance seeks restitution, grace received is grace reflected, and reconciled relationships mirror God&#8217;s own welcoming face.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">For therefore I have seen thy face.</span>--The latter half of the verse would more correctly be translated, <span class= "ital">inasmuch as I have seen thy face as one seeth the face of Elohim, and thou hast received me graciously. </span>To the Hebrew the thought of God was not terrifying, and so the vision of God's face was the sight of something good and glorious. There is much of Oriental hyperbole in comparing the sight of Esau to the beholding of the face of Deity, but it clearly conveyed the idea that Esau was using his power as generously and lovingly as is the wont of God; and God was so much nearer to the Hebrew in those simple days than he is to men now that science has revealed to them the immensity of His attributes, that there was no irreverence in the comparison.<p>The behaviour of Esau is very generous. He wished to spare his brother so large a present, and therefore leads the conversation to it, knowing, of course, what was the meaning of the five herds, as their drivers had delivered to him Jacob's message. To have refused it, however, would have been a mark of hostility, especially as Jacob represented it as the gift of an inferior for the purpose of obtaining the favour of one from whom he had feared danger. But Esau expostulates with his brother. He too was rich, and Jacob should keep what was his own. But Jacob still urges its acceptance as the proof of goodwill, magnifies the value of Esau's favour, and declares that by God's goodness he has still abundance, even after giving his brother so princely a present. It is called "blessing" because it was considered lucky to receive a gift, and of all good-luck God was the giver.

Hence Jacob with greater urgency renews his entreaty that Esau would not decline his proffered gift, saying, <span class="cmt_word">Take, I pray thee, my blessing</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my present, the word signifying, as in <a href="/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>, a gift by which one seeks to express good will) <span class="cmt_word">that is brought to thee</span>; - or, which has been caused to come to thee, adding, as a special reason to induce him to accept - <span class="cmt_word">because God hath dealt graciously with me,</span> - Elohim, it has been thought, is used here and in ver. 5 by Jacob instead of Jehovah, either "<span class="accented">to</span> avoid reminding Esau of the blessing of Jehovah which had occasioned his absence" (Delitzsch, Keil), or, " because Jehovah was exalted far above the level of Esau's superficial religion" Hengstenberg); but it is just possible that by its employment Jacob only wished to acknowledge the Divine hand in the remark- able prosperity which had attended him in Haran - <span class="cmt_word">and because I have enough</span> - literally, <span class="accented">there is to</span> me all, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. everything I can wish (Murphy), all things as the heir of the promise (Keil). The expression is stronger than that used by Esau (ver. 9), and is regarded by some (Ainsworth) as indicating a more contented spirit than that evinced by Esau. <span class="cmt_word">And he urged him</span>. In Eastern countries the acceptance of a gift is equivalent to the striking of a covenant of friendship. If your present be received by your superior yon may rely on his friendship; if it be declined you have everything to fear. It was on this ground that Jacob was so urgent in pressing Esau to accept his present (cf. A. Clarke <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And he took it,</span> and so gave Jacob an assurance of his complete reconciliation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/33-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">insisted,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
