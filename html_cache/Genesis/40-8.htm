The context here is Joseph's imprisonment in Egypt, where he encounters Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker. Dreams in this culture were not just personal experiences but were often believed to have implications for the future or for the community. The fact that both men had dreams on the same night suggests a divine orchestration, setting the stage for Joseph's role in God's plan.<p><b>&#8220;but there is no one to interpret them.&#8221;</b><br>In Egyptian culture, professional dream interpreters were common, often serving in the royal court. The cupbearer and baker's statement highlights their isolation and the absence of these professionals in prison. This sets the stage for Joseph, who, unlike the Egyptian magicians, attributes the ability to interpret dreams to God. This moment underscores the limitations of human wisdom and the need for divine insight.<p><b>Then Joseph said to them,</b><br>Joseph's response is immediate and confident, reflecting his faith and trust in God. Despite his own unjust circumstances, Joseph remains attentive to the needs of others, demonstrating his character and leadership qualities. This interaction is pivotal, as it eventually leads to his rise to power in Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interpretations belong to God?</b><br>Joseph's rhetorical question emphasizes the sovereignty of God over all things, including the mysteries of dreams. This statement is a declaration of monotheism in a polytheistic culture, asserting that true wisdom and understanding come from the one true God. It also foreshadows Joseph's role as a prophet-like figure, through whom God reveals His plans.<p><b>Tell me your dreams.&#8221;</b><br>Joseph invites the men to share their dreams, positioning himself as a vessel through which God can work. This act of faith and service is a turning point in Joseph's life, leading to his eventual release and rise to power. It also prefigures the role of Jesus Christ, who invites humanity to bring their burdens to Him, offering divine insight and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers and ended up in Egypt.

Their admission, &#8220;We both had dreams,&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>a) spotlights God&#8217;s sovereign use of dreams for revelation, just as He did with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12-16</a>), Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12-15</a>), and later with Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>).<p>- Dreams in Scripture aren&#8217;t random nighttime images; they can be divine messages requiring discernment. Compare <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, where the Lord says, &#8220;I speak with him in dreams,&#8221; affirming that God sometimes chooses this medium to guide His purposes.<p>- Practical implication: when God speaks, He does so intentionally and coherently, never by accident (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But there is no one to interpret them</b><p>- Their anxiety flows from the absence of an interpreter. In Egyptian culture, professional &#8220;dream readers&#8221; existed (<a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>). Yet in the prison, such experts are unavailable.<p>- Scripture often shows human wisdom reaching its limits (<a href="/daniel/2-10.htm">Daniel 2:10-11</a>). The cupbearer and baker thus feel stranded&#8212;an acknowledgment that purely human resources cannot unlock divine mysteries (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>- This tension prepares the stage for God&#8217;s servant to step forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Don&#8217;t interpretations belong to God?</b><p>- Joseph&#8217;s question is both correction and confession. He declares the exclusive prerogative of the Lord: &#8220;interpretations belong to God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>b).<p>- Other passages echo this truth: <a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>, &#8220;There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries,&#8221; and <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.&#8221;<p>- Joseph&#8217;s statement guards against self-glory. Unlike pagan diviners, he refuses credit, pointing all recognition to the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p>- Application bullet points:<p>&#8226; Seek God first when facing unclear circumstances (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust that divine wisdom surpasses every human method (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell me your dreams</b><p>- Having acknowledged God as the true interpreter, Joseph invites them to speak. This shows confident faith: he expects God to act through him (<a href="/hebrews/11-22.htm">Hebrews 11:22</a>).<p>- Joseph positions himself as a conduit, much like Samuel who said, &#8220;Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-9.htm">1 Samuel 3:9-10</a>).<p>- The invitation also illustrates compassionate ministry. Even in confinement, Joseph serves others, foreshadowing Christ who came &#8220;not to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p>- Note the blend of humility and boldness: humility in relying on God; boldness in acting once reliance is clear (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a> teaches that while people may sense divine communication, only God supplies the true meaning. Human expertise falters, but the Lord reveals mysteries through faithful servants who humbly depend on Him. Joseph&#8217;s response models how believers today should handle ambiguity: recognize God&#8217;s sovereign voice, reject self-reliance, and step forward in obedient confidence to serve others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">There is no interpreter.</span>--In Egypt it was the business of men trained for the purpose, called in <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm" title="And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.">Genesis 41:8</a>, <span class= "ital">magicians </span>and <span class= "ital">wise men, </span>to interpret dreams, and to such the butler and baker could have no access from their prison.
