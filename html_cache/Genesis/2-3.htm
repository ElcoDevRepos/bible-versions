Here, God sets apart the seventh day as special, indicating its importance. This blessing is not just a verbal declaration but an impartation of divine favor and purpose. The seventh day, later known as the Sabbath, becomes a recurring theme throughout Scripture, symbolizing rest and completion. In <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, the Sabbath is instituted as a day of rest for the Israelites, reflecting God's rest after creation. The blessing of the seventh day also foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.<p><b>and sanctified it</b><br>To sanctify means to set apart as holy. By sanctifying the seventh day, God distinguishes it from the other days of creation. This act of sanctification establishes a pattern for humanity to follow&#8212;a rhythm of work and rest. The sanctification of the Sabbath is a precursor to the holiness required of God's people, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God calls His people to be holy as He is holy. The sanctification of the day also points to the future sanctification of believers through Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>because on that day He rested</b><br>God's rest is not due to fatigue but signifies the completion and satisfaction of His creative work. This rest serves as a model for humanity, emphasizing the importance of rest and reflection. The Hebrew word for rest, "Shabbat," is the root for the word Sabbath, indicating cessation from labor. This rest is a divine pause, allowing for contemplation and appreciation of creation. It also prefigures the eternal rest promised to believers, as described in <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, where the faithful rest from their labors.<p><b>from all the work of creation</b><br>The phrase underscores the totality and perfection of God's creative acts. Everything necessary for life and sustenance was completed in six days, highlighting God's omnipotence and wisdom. This completion of creation sets the stage for humanity's stewardship of the earth, as outlined in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. The work of creation is a testament to God's power and serves as a foundation for understanding His ongoing relationship with the world. It also points to the new creation in Christ, where believers are made new (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>that He had accomplished</b><br>The use of "accomplished" indicates the intentionality and purposefulness of God's actions. Creation was not a random act but a deliberate and orderly process. This accomplishment reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to bring His plans to fruition. The completion of creation is a reminder of God's faithfulness and the assurance that He will accomplish His purposes in history, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate accomplishment of redemption through Jesus Christ, who declared, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), signifying the completion of His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who completed His work of creation and set apart the seventh day as holy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventh_day.htm">Seventh Day</a></b><br>The day God blessed and sanctified, marking the completion of creation and the institution of rest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The work that God completed, which includes the heavens, the earth, and all living things.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_rest.htm">The Principle of Rest</a></b><br>God established a pattern of work and rest, highlighting the importance of rest in our lives.

As afterwards Mount Sinai was sanctified (<a href="/exodus/19-23.htm">Exodus 19:23</a>), or, for the time being, invested with a sacred character as the residence of God; and Aaron and his sons were sanctified, or consecrated to the priestly office (<a href="/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>); and the year of Jubilee was sanctified, or devoted to the purposes of religion (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), so here was the seventh day sanctified, or instituted in the interests of holiness, and as such proclaimed to be a holy day. <span class="cmt_word">Because that in it he had</span> <span class="cmt_word">rested from all his work which God had created and made</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">created to make</span>, the exact import of which has been variously explained.

Calvin, Ainsworth, Bush, <span class="accented">et alii</span> take the second verb <span class="accented">emphatice</span>, as intensifying the action of the first, and conveying the idea of a perfect creation. Kalisch, Alford, and others explain the second as <span class="accented">epexegetic</span> of the first, as in the similar phrases, "spoke, saying, literally, spoke to speak" (<a href="/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and "<span class="accented">labor</span>ed to do" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>). Onkelos, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">quod Dens creavit ut faceret</span>), Calvin, Tayler Lewis, etc. understand the infinitive in a <span class="accented">relic</span> sense, as expressive of the purpose for which the heavens and the earth were at first created, viz., that by the six days' work they might be fashioned into a cosmos. It has been observed that the usual concluding formula is not appended to the record of the seventh day, and the reason has perhaps been declared by Augustine: "Dies autem septimus sine vespera eat, nee habet occasum, quia sanctificasti eum ad permansionem sempiternam" ('Confess.,' 13:36). But now what was this seventh day which received Elohim's benediction? On the principle of interpretation applied to the creative days, this must be regarded as a period of indefinite duration, compounding to the human era of both Scripture and geology. But other Scriptures (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-12.htm">Deuteronomy 5:12</a>, etc.) show that the Hebrews were enjoined by God to observe a seventh day rest in imitation of himself. There are also indications that sabbatic observance was not unknown to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27, 28</a>), to the antediluvians (<a href="/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6-12</a>), and to Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>). Profane history likewise vouches for the veracity of the statement of Josephus, that "there is not any city of the Grecians, nor any of the barbarians, nor any nation whatsoever, whither our custom of resting on the seventh day hath not come" ('Contra Apionem,' 2:40). The ancient Persians, Indians, and Germans esteemed the number seven as sacred. By the Greeks and Phoenicians a sacred character was ascribed to the seventh day. The Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity were acquainted with the hebdomadal division of time. Travelers have detected traces of it among the African and American aborigines. To account for its existence among nations so widely apart, both chronologically and geographically, recourse has been had to some violent hypotheses; as, e.g., to the number of the primary planets known to the ancients (Humboldt), the division of a lunar month into four nearly equal periods of seven days (Ideler, Baden Powell, etc.), Jewish example (Josephus). Its true genesis, however, must be sought for in the primitive observance of a seventh day rest in accordance with Divine appointment. Precisely as we reason that the early and widespread prevalence of sacrifice can only be explained by an authoritative revelation to the first parents of the human family of such a mode of worship, so do we conclude that a seventh day sabbath must have been prescribed to man in Eden. The question then arises, Is this sabbath also referred to in the Mosaic record of the seventh day? The popular Belief is that the institution of the weekly sabbath alone is the subject spoken of in the opening verses of the present chapter; and the language of <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> may at first sight appear to warrant this conclusion. A more careful consideration of the phraseology employed by Moses, how ever, shows that in the mind of the Hebrew lawgiver there existed a distinction between God's seventh day and man's sabbath, and that, instead of identifying the two, he meant to teach that the first was the reason of the second; as thus - "In six days God made.... and rested on the seventh day; where fore God blessed the (weekly) sabbath day, and hallowed it." Here it is commonly assumed that the words are exactly parallel to those in <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, and that the sabbath in Exodus corresponds to the seventh day of Genesis. But this is open to debate. The seventh day which God blessed in Eden was the first day of human life, and not the seventh day; and it is certain that God did not rest from his labors on man's seventh day, but on man's first. We feel inclined then to hold with Luther that in <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> Moses says nothing about man's day, and that the seventh day which received the Divine benediction was God's own great aeonian period of sabbatic rest. At the same time, for the reasons above specified, believing that a weekly sabbath was pre scribed to man from the beginning, we have no difficulty in assenting to the words of Tayler Lewis: "'And God blessed the seventh day.' Which seventh day, the greater or the less, the Divine or the human, the aeonian or the astronomical? Both, is the easy answer; both, as commencing at the same time, so far as the one connects with astronomical time; both, as the greater including the less; both, as being (the one as represented, the other as typically representing) the same essence and idea." It does not appear necessary to refute the idea that the weekly sabbath had no existence till the giving of the law, and that it is only here proleptically referred to by Moses.
