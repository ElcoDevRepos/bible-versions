This journey highlights Joseph's obedience and trust in his father, despite the animosity his brothers held against him. The brothers' location in Dothan, a significant distance from Hebron, suggests a deliberate move away from their father's oversight, possibly indicating their rebellious nature. This moment foreshadows the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams, where his brothers' actions set the stage for God's providential plan.<p><b>they stripped him of his robe</b><br>The act of stripping Joseph of his robe symbolizes the brothers' deep-seated jealousy and resentment. The robe, a gift from Jacob, represented Joseph's favored status and the special love his father had for him. By removing it, the brothers sought to strip Joseph of his identity and the favor he held. This act of violence is a precursor to the suffering and trials Joseph would endure, paralleling the suffering of Christ, who was also stripped of his garments before His crucifixion.<p><b>the robe of many colors he was wearing</b><br>The robe of many colors, often interpreted as a richly ornamented tunic, signifies the unique position Joseph held in his family. This garment set him apart, not only as Jacob's favorite but also as a symbol of authority and future leadership. The robe's removal is a pivotal moment, marking the beginning of Joseph's journey from favored son to a position of power in Egypt. This event can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though stripped of His earthly glory, was exalted to a position of authority and honor. The robe also connects to the theme of garments throughout Scripture, symbolizing righteousness, identity, and divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

href="/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17-18</a>), Joseph arrives with a servant&#8217;s heart, unaware of hostility brewing.<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates a greater parallel: &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>), hinting that Joseph&#8217;s experience will foreshadow Christ&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence overrules the setting&#8212;Shechem then Dothan&#8212;so Joseph will be exactly where divine purpose intends (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they stripped him of his

53:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing the robe removes the visible reminder of favoritism, yet it cannot remove God&#8217;s favor resting on Joseph (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the robe of many colors he was wearing</b><p>&#8226; This distinctive garment, first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>, symbolized Jacob&#8217;s special love
