The mention of sons being born to Shem highlights the continuation of the human race post-flood and the fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). Shem's lineage is particularly important as it leads to the Semitic peoples, including the Israelites. This phrase sets the stage for the genealogies that follow, emphasizing the importance of family lines in biblical narratives.<p><b>the older brother of Japheth</b><br>This phrase indicates the birth order among Noah's sons, which is relevant for understanding the distribution of nations and peoples. Japheth's descendants are traditionally associated with the peoples of Europe and parts of Asia. The mention of Shem as the older brother may imply a position of prominence or responsibility, which is consistent with the biblical theme of the elder sibling often having a significant role, though not always the primary blessing, as seen in the stories of Esau and Jacob or Manasseh and Ephraim.<p><b>Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber</b><br>Eber is a significant figure as he is considered the ancestor of the Hebrews. The term "Hebrew" is derived from Eber, and this connection is crucial for understanding the identity of the Israelites. This lineage underscores the importance of Shem's descendants in the biblical narrative, as they lead to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the patriarchs of Israel. The genealogical link to Eber also highlights the continuity of God's covenant promises through specific family lines, ultimately leading to the coming of Jesus Christ, who is traced back to Shem through the genealogies in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shem.htm">Shem</a></b><br>The son of Noah, considered the ancestor of the Semitic peoples.

But just as the Semitic Asshur expelled a Hamite race from Assyria, so another branch of this conquering family occupied Elymais.
