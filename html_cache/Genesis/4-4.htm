The "best portions" indicate that Abel gave God the choicest parts, demonstrating his faith and devotion. This act of giving the firstborn is a precursor to the later Mosaic Law, where the firstborn of the flock was considered sacred and set apart for God (<a href="/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>). The firstborn also symbolizes the best and the most valuable, showing Abel's willingness to sacrifice what was most precious to him. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "firstborn over all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>) and the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), representing the ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</b><br>The Lord's favor on Abel and his offering highlights the importance of the heart's condition in worship. Unlike Cain, whose offering was not accepted, Abel's was received because it was given in faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>). This distinction underscores the biblical principle that God values the attitude and faith behind the offering more than the offering itself. The favor shown by God can be seen as a foreshadowing of the grace that believers receive through faith in Jesus Christ. This passage also sets a precedent for the concept of divine approval based on faith and righteousness, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, culminating in the New Testament teachings on salvation by faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abel.htm">Abel</a></b><br>The second son of Adam and Eve, a shepherd who offered a sacrifice to God from the firstborn of his flock.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>Abel's older brother, a farmer who also made an offering to God, but it was not accepted.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who evaluates the offerings of Cain and Abel, showing favor to Abel's offering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offering.htm">The Offering</a></b><br>Abel's offering consisted of the best portions of the firstborn of his flock, indicating a sacrifice of quality and priority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>The act of offering sacrifices to God, which leads to God favoring Abel's offering over Cain's.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_worship.htm">The Heart of Worship</a></b><br>Abel's offering was accepted because it was given with a sincere heart and faith.

"The sacrifice was accepted for the man, and not the man for the sacrifice" (Ainsworth); but still "without a doubt the words of Moses imply that the matter of Abel's offering was more excellent and suitable than that of Cain's," and one can hardly entertain a doubt that this was the idea of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews" (Prof. Lindsay, 'Lectures on Hebrews,' Edin. 1867). Abel's sacrifice was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, fuller than Cain's; it had more in it; it had faith, which was wanting in the other. It was also offered in obedience to Divine prescription. The universal prevalence of sacrifice rather points to Divine prescription than to man's invention as its proper source. Had Divine worship been of purely human origin, it is almost certain that greater diversity would have prevailed in its forms. Besides, the fact that the mode of worship was not left to human ingenuity under the law, and that will-worship is specifically condemned under the Christian dispensation (<a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>), favors the presumption that it was Divinely appointed from the first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">while Abel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1448;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;he&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
