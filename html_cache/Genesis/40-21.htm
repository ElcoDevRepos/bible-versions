The role of the cupbearer was significant in ancient Egypt, as he was responsible for serving drinks to the Pharaoh and ensuring they were not poisoned. This restoration signifies a return to favor and trust, reflecting the importance of loyalty and reliability in royal courts. The act of restoration can be seen as a type of resurrection or redemption, prefiguring the ultimate restoration and redemption found in Jesus Christ.<p><b>so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand</b><br>The act of placing the cup in Pharaoh's hand symbolizes the cupbearer's reinstated authority and trust. This action is a daily, intimate interaction with the Pharaoh, indicating a close relationship and the cupbearer's essential role in the royal household. The imagery of the cup can also be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the cup during the Last Supper, symbolizing His blood and the new covenant.

Joseph had interpreted the dream exactly three days earlier (<a href="/genesis/40-12.htm">Genesis 40:12-13</a>), and the fulfillment testifies to God&#8217;s precise control over events. Just as later God would turn Pharaoh&#8217;s heart toward Joseph in <a href="/bsb/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, here He guides the same monarch to reverse the cupbearer&#8217;s sentence. The restoration proves that when God speaks, even the mightiest earthly authority must align with His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the chief cupbearer</b><p>A cupbearer was more than a royal waiter. He tasted the wine to guard the king&#8217;s life, carried confidential access, and often advised the throne&#8212;much like Nehemiah centuries later (<a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>). To lose such a post meant disgrace and distance from power; to regain it meant renewed honor. <a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a> highlights how cupbearers reflected a monarch&#8217;s glory. In Joseph&#8217;s story, the cupbearer will become a pivotal link between the dungeon and the palace (<a href="/genesis/41-9.htm">Genesis 41:9-13</a>), showing how God uses unlikely people to open doors for His servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his position</b><p>The phrase underscores a complete reinstatement&#8212;rank, privileges, trust, and proximity. Scripture repeatedly shows God returning people to places they thought forever lost: Job received double after his trial (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>), and the Lord &#8220;seats them with princes&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>). Likewise, the cupbearer is not merely pardoned; he is fully restored, illustrating that divine redemption goes beyond forgiveness to renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that he once again placed the cup</b><p>Restoration had a purpose: active, daily service. &#8220;Now it is required of stewards that they be found faithful&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>), and the cupbearer&#8217;s first test of faithfulness was simply to resume the task God had given him. <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a> reminds us that faithfulness in small duties positions us for larger responsibilities. Every time the cup touched Pharaoh&#8217;s lips, it silently affirmed God&#8217;s faithfulness in fulfilling Joseph&#8217;s words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand</b><p>The cupbearer&#8217;s hand met the king&#8217;s hand&#8212;symbolizing renewed intimacy and complete trust. In <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a> Pharaoh will place a ring on Joseph&#8217;s hand; here he receives a cup from the servant&#8217;s hand. Both scenes show how God weaves human hands into His sovereign plan. The &#8220;cup&#8221; also points forward to Jesus&#8217; reference to &#8220;My cup&#8221; in <a href="/matthew/20-23.htm">Matthew 20:23</a>, hinting that cups can signify destiny and trust under higher authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/40-21.htm">Genesis 40:21</a> records more than a royal personnel change. It displays God&#8217;s sovereignty over rulers, His ability to restore fully, His use of seemingly minor officials to advance His purposes, and His call to faithful service once restoration comes. The cupbearer&#8217;s reinstatement sets the stage for Joseph&#8217;s rise and reminds us that when God promises, He performs&#8212;down to the last detail of a cup placed in a king&#8217;s hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
