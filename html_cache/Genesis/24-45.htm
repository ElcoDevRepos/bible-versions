The servant's prayer was a silent one, indicating that God hears the prayers of the heart, not just those spoken aloud. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. It also underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to orchestrate events according to His will, as seen throughout the narrative of Genesis.<p><b>there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder</b><br>Rebekah's appearance at the well is significant, as wells were central to community life in ancient Near Eastern culture, serving as gathering places and sources of life-sustaining water. Her carrying a jar on her shoulder indicates her role and responsibilities within her family, reflecting the customs of the time. This moment is a divine appointment, orchestrated by God, and parallels other biblical instances where women at wells play pivotal roles, such as Rachel (Genesis 29) and the Samaritan woman (John 4). Rebekah's introduction here foreshadows her importance in the Abrahamic lineage.<p><b>and she went down to the spring and drew water</b><br>The act of drawing water is a humble task, yet it is through this simple act that God's plan begins to unfold. The spring, or well, symbolizes a place of provision and blessing, often associated with God's faithfulness and sustenance. This scene echoes the provision of water in the wilderness for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>) and the living water offered by Jesus (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>). Rebekah's willingness to serve by drawing water demonstrates her character and suitability as Isaac's wife, aligning with the servant's prayer for a sign of kindness and hospitality.<p><b>So I said to her, &#8216;Please give me a drink.&#8217;</b><br>The servant's request for a drink is a test of Rebekah's hospitality and kindness, qualities highly valued in the cultural context of the time. Hospitality was a sacred duty in the ancient Near East, and this request serves as a practical test of Rebekah's character. Her response would reveal her willingness to go beyond the expected, reflecting the servant's prayer for a sign. This interaction prefigures the New Testament teaching of serving others, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, where providing a drink to the thirsty is an act of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, often identified as Eliezer, is tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.
