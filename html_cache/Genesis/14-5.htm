It suggests a period of subjugation and tribute by the local kings to Chedorlaomer, which is significant in understanding the political landscape of the time. The number fourteen can also be seen as a double of seven, a number often associated with completeness or divine order in the Bible.<p><b>Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him</b><br>Chedorlaomer was the king of Elam, a region located in present-day southwestern Iran. His alliance with other kings, including those of Shinar, Ellasar, and Goiim, demonstrates the political alliances and coalitions common in the ancient Near East. This coalition reflects the power dynamics and the need for smaller kingdoms to band together for military campaigns. Chedorlaomer's leadership in this alliance indicates his prominence and influence.<p><b>went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-karnaim</b><br>The Rephaites were a group of ancient people known for their size and strength, often associated with giants in biblical texts. Ashteroth-karnaim is located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. This victory over the Rephaites signifies the military prowess of Chedorlaomer's coalition and their ability to conquer formidable foes. The Rephaites are mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20-21</a>, where they are described as a people as great and numerous as the Anakim.<p><b>the Zuzites in Ham</b><br>The Zuzites, also known as the Zamzummim, were another group of people living in the region. The location "Ham" is less clearly identified but is thought to be in the vicinity of the Transjordan area. The defeat of the Zuzites further emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Chedorlaomer's campaign, as he systematically subdued various tribes and peoples.<p><b>the Emites in Shaveh-kiriathaim</b><br>The Emites were a people described in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a> as great, numerous, and tall, like the Anakim. Shaveh-kiriathaim is believed to be located in the region of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. The mention of these specific locations and peoples highlights the extensive reach of Chedorlaomer's military campaign. The Emites' defeat is part of the broader narrative of conquest and control in the region, setting the stage for the subsequent events involving Abram and Lot.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kedorlaomer.htm">Kedorlaomer</a></b><br>A king of Elam who led a coalition of kings in battle.
