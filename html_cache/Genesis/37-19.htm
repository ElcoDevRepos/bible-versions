Joseph was known for his dreams, which he shared with his family, indicating that he would one day rule over them. These dreams are recorded earlier in <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>. The term "dreamer" is used here with a tone of mockery and disdain, reflecting the brothers' jealousy and resentment. Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered significant, sometimes seen as divine messages. Joseph's dreams were prophetic, foreshadowing his future rise to power in Egypt and the eventual fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham's descendants.<p><b>they said to one another.</b><br>This indicates a collective sentiment among the brothers, highlighting their unity in opposition to Joseph. The brothers' conspiracy against Joseph is a pivotal moment in the narrative, setting the stage for his eventual sale into slavery and subsequent rise to power in Egypt. This phrase also reflects the theme of sibling rivalry, a recurring motif in Genesis, seen in the stories of Cain and Abel, Isaac and Ishmael, and Jacob and Esau. The brothers' actions, driven by jealousy and hatred, contrast with Joseph's later forgiveness and reconciliation, illustrating themes of redemption and divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the son of Jacob and Rachel.
