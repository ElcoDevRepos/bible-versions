Rivers in the Bible often represent life, abundance, and divine blessing. The river flowing out of Eden can be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit, who flows from God to bring life and nourishment to His creation. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>, where a river of the water of life flows from the throne of God and the Lamb, symbolizing eternal life and divine presence.<p><b>to water the garden</b><br>The purpose of the river is to irrigate the Garden of Eden, ensuring its fertility and beauty. This reflects God's care and provision for His creation, ensuring that the garden remains a place of abundance and life. The garden can be seen as a type of the Kingdom of God, where God provides for His people and sustains them. The concept of God as a provider is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd who leads His people to green pastures and still waters.<p><b>and from there it branched into four headwaters:</b><br>The river's division into four headwaters suggests a spreading out of God's blessing and provision to the whole earth. The number four often symbolizes universality in the Bible, representing the four corners of the earth. This branching out can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Gospel spreading to all nations, as Jesus commanded in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>. The four rivers mentioned later in the passage (Pishon, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates) have been subjects of much debate regarding their geographical and historical identification, but they symbolize the reach and influence of God's provision and presence throughout the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eden.htm">Eden</a></b><br>A region created by God, symbolizing a place of divine provision and presence.

The tenses, too, are present, as if the main features of the country remained unchanged: "a river goeth forth from Eden, and thence outside of it is parted, and becometh four main streams." The idea is that of a stream rising in Eden, and flowing through the Paradise, and at some distance outside of it divided into four great rivers. This has made many suppose that the site of Paradise was in the Persian Gulf, in a region now submerged; and the Babylonian legends actually place it there, at Eridu, at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. The two other rivers they suppose to have been the Indus and the Nile, represented by the two coasts of the Persian Gulf. Sir H. Rawlinson suggests the Babylonian province of Gan-duniyas, where four rivers may be found; but in neither case could the ark have floated against the current of the flood up to the highlands of Armenia. We must add that many authors of note have regarded the whole as symbolical, among whom is the famous Syriac writer, Bar-Hebraeus, who regards it as a description of the human body.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The precise locality of Eden is indicated by its relation to the great watercourses of the region. <span class="cmt_word">And a river</span> (literally, a flowing water, applicable to large oceanic floods - <a href="/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>; <a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> - as well as to narrow streams) <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> (literally, going out) <span class="cmt_word">of Eden to water the garden.</span> To conclude from this that the river had its source within the limits of the garden is to infer more than the premises will warrant. Nothing more is implied in the language than that a great watercourse proceeded through the district of Eden, and served to irrigate the soil. Probably it intersected the garden, thus occasioning its remarkable fecundity and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">And from thence</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> either on emerging from which, or, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;</span> in its secondary sense, outside of, or at a distance from which) <span class="cmt_word">it was parted</span> (literally, divided itself), <span class="cmt_word">and became into four heads.</span> <span class="accented">Roshim</span>, from <span class="accented">rosh</span>, that which is highest; either principal waters, arms or branches (Taylor Lewis, Alford), or beginnings of rivers, indicating the sources of the streams (Gesenius, Keil, Macdonald, Murphy). If the second of these interpretations be adopted, Eden must be looked for in a spot where some great flowing water is subdivided into four separate streams; if the former be regarded as the proper exegesis, then any great river which is first formed by the junction of two streams, and afterwards disperses its waters in two different directions, will meet the requirements of the case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a river</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;h&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
