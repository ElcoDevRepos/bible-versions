Water was a precious resource, especially in arid regions, and providing it demonstrated care and respect. This act reflects Abraham's character as a hospitable and righteous man, aligning with the biblical emphasis on hospitality (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>). The provision of water also symbolizes spiritual cleansing and refreshment, foreshadowing the living water offered by Christ (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>).<p><b>that you may wash your feet</b><br>Foot washing was a customary practice in biblical times due to the dusty and dirty conditions of travel. It was a sign of welcome and respect, often performed by servants. This act of humility and service prefigures Jesus washing the disciples' feet (<a href="/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5-15</a>), illustrating themes of servanthood and purification. It also signifies the cleansing from sin, a recurring biblical theme (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>).<p><b>and rest yourselves under the tree</b><br>The tree likely refers to a terebinth or oak, common in the region and providing necessary shade in the hot climate. Resting under a tree symbolizes peace and refuge, reminiscent of the Tree of Life in Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>) and the future rest promised in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).
