Sarai's decision to give Hagar to Abram was in line with these customs. However, Sarai's statement reflects her frustration and sense of betrayal. The phrase "may the wrong done to me be upon you" indicates that Sarai holds Abram responsible for the resulting discord, highlighting the patriarchal structure where the husband was seen as the head of the household and responsible for its harmony.<p><b>I delivered my servant into your arms,</b><br>This phrase underscores Sarai's active role in the decision to give Hagar to Abram. It reflects the legal and social customs of the time, where a wife could offer her maidservant to her husband to bear children on her behalf. This act was meant to secure an heir and ensure the continuation of the family line. The phrase "into your arms" suggests a transfer of authority and responsibility, as Hagar was still considered Sarai's servant despite bearing Abram's child.<p><b>and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt.</b><br>Hagar's change in attitude upon becoming pregnant is significant. In the ancient world, fertility was highly valued, and a woman's status could be elevated by bearing children. Hagar's contempt for Sarai likely stems from her newfound status as the mother of Abram's child, which she may have perceived as elevating her above Sarai. This shift in dynamics introduces tension and conflict, illustrating the complexities of surrogate arrangements and the emotional turmoil they can cause.<p><b>May the LORD judge between you and me.&#8221;</b><br>Sarai's appeal to the LORD as judge reflects her faith and reliance on divine justice. In the biblical narrative, invoking God's judgment is a serious matter, indicating that Sarai feels deeply wronged and seeks divine intervention to resolve the conflict. This appeal also underscores the covenant relationship between God and Abram's family, as they look to God for guidance and resolution. The invocation of the LORD's judgment highlights the moral and ethical dimensions of the situation, suggesting that human actions are ultimately accountable to divine standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarai.htm">Sarai</a></b><br>The wife of Abram, later known as Sarah.

Sarai&#8217;s final appeal to God acknowledges that only the Lord can untangle sinful choices and deliver true justice.
