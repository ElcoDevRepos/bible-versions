He is a patriarch in the lineage of the Israelites and is often seen as a type of Christ, representing obedience and submission to God's will. His life is marked by God's promises and blessings, which are passed down from Abraham.<br><br>Settled: The act of settling indicates a temporary or semi-permanent residence. In the context of the nomadic lifestyle of the patriarchs, settling in a place often involved establishing a camp or community. This decision reflects obedience to God's guidance, as Isaac was instructed to stay in the land rather than go to Egypt during a famine.<br><br>Gerar: Gerar is a Philistine city located in the Negev region, south of Canaan. It is significant in the biblical narrative as a place where both Abraham and Isaac interacted with the Philistine king, Abimelech. Archaeological evidence suggests that Gerar was a well-established city during the time of the patriarchs, with a strategic location for trade and agriculture. The presence of Isaac in Gerar highlights the ongoing interactions and tensions between the Israelites and the Philistines, which are a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This setting also foreshadows future conflicts and alliances between these groups.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of the Israelites.
