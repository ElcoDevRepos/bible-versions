The seven thin, ugly cows represent seven years of famine that will follow seven years of abundance. In ancient Egypt, cattle were a symbol of wealth and prosperity, making the image of thin, ugly cows particularly striking as a representation of scarcity and hardship. This interpretation highlights the cyclical nature of agricultural societies, where periods of plenty are often followed by times of need. The number seven is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing completeness or divine perfection, suggesting that the famine will be a complete and divinely ordained period of testing.<p><b>and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind</b><br>The seven worthless heads of grain further emphasize the severity of the coming famine. Grain was a staple food in Egypt, and its failure would have dire consequences. The east wind, known as the "khamsin" in the region, is a hot, dry wind that can devastate crops. This natural phenomenon is used here to illustrate the divine orchestration of events, as God uses natural elements to fulfill His purposes. The imagery of scorched grain connects to other biblical instances where God uses environmental conditions to execute His will, such as the plagues in Exodus.<p><b>they are seven years of famine</b><br>The repetition of the phrase underscores the certainty and seriousness of the prophecy. Famine was a common and feared occurrence in the ancient Near East, often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or a test of faith. This period of famine would serve as a test for Egypt and a means for God to elevate Joseph to a position of power, ultimately preserving the lineage of Israel. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where Joseph's role as a savior of his people prefigures Christ's ultimate salvation. The famine also sets the stage for the migration of Jacob's family to Egypt, a pivotal moment in the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who is interpreting Pharaoh's dreams in Egypt.

He is connecting the thin cows and the scorched grain to the earlier dream elements, underscoring that both dreams carry one united message from God (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>). Just as in <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15&#8211;16</a> Peter receives a repeated vision to secure the point, Pharaoh&#8217;s two dreams double-underline divine certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them</b><p>These gaunt animals vividly picture scarcity:<p>&#8226; Their appearance follows the fat cows (<a href="/genesis/41-3.htm">Genesis 41:3&#8211;4</a>), showing that famine will interrupt prosperity&#8212;much like how the drought followed Elijah&#8217;s prediction after years of rain (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; They devour the healthy cattle yet remain thin, portraying a hunger that consumes every reserve (compare <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, where bread is rationed yet never satisfies).<p>The realism of the dream affirms God&#8217;s concern for Egypt&#8217;s future, reminding us that &#8220;the LORD does nothing without revealing His plan&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are seven years</b><p>Joseph states the symbolic equivalence plainly: the cows represent years. Scripture often uses numbered symbols this way&#8212;the seven circuits around Jericho equaled seven days of marching (<a href="/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3&#8211;4</a>). Here, seven years sets a defined limit; God both begins and ends seasons (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-2</a>). The literal time frame encourages Pharaoh to act, as Noah acted when told exactly when the flood would start (<a href="/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind</b><p>The second image confirms the first. Grain, not animals, touches Egypt&#8217;s agricultural heart:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Worthless&#8221; shows the crops have no yield, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>, &#8220;You will sow much seed&#8230;but harvest little, because locusts will consume it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The &#8220;east wind&#8221; in Scripture often brings judgment or desolation (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>). Just as <a href="/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a> pictures ships shattered by an east wind, Egypt&#8217;s food supply will be shattered by this withering blast.<p>Pairing cattle with grain covers both livestock and harvest, signaling a comprehensive crisis (<a href="/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8212;they are seven years of famine</b><p>Joseph finally names the threat: famine.<p>&#8226; The repetition of &#8220;seven years&#8221; locks the duration; nothing can shorten or extend it apart from God (<a href="/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a> later confirms two of those years have passed).<p>&#8226; The coming scarcity contrasts sharply with the preceding abundance (<a href="/genesis/41-29.htm">Genesis 41:29-30</a>). Just as Joseph later stores grain during the good years (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>), believers are urged to &#8220;redeem the time&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>) during seasons of blessing.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s forewarning is mercy; through Joseph, He provides a plan of salvation for many nations (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>), foreshadowing Christ who secures eternal rescue (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a> reveals that God translates Pharaoh&#8217;s troubling dream into a clear prophecy: seven specific, approaching years of devastating famine will follow seven years of plenty. The thin cows and scorched grain graphically portray the severity and total reach of the coming hardship. By declaring both its certainty and its limited span, the Lord invites wise preparation, proving yet again that His sovereign warnings carry redemptive purpose for those who listen and respond.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/41-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moreover, the seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;e&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
