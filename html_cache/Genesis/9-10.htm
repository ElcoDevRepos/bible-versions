It reflects the biblical theme of God's care for all creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>, which speaks of God's compassion over all He has made. The covenant with Noah is a precursor to the ultimate redemption of creation, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>, where creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay.<p><b>the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth</b><br>This enumeration highlights the diversity of life preserved through the flood. It mirrors the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates various kinds of animals. The mention of specific categories of animals underscores the comprehensive nature of God's covenant, ensuring the survival and flourishing of all forms of life. This reflects God's original command in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> for humanity to steward and care for the earth and its creatures.<p><b>every living thing that came out of the ark</b><br>This phrase signifies the new beginning for all life post-flood. The ark serves as a type of Christ, providing salvation and deliverance from judgment. Just as Noah and the animals were saved through the ark, believers find salvation in Christ. The emergence from the ark symbolizes a fresh start, akin to the new creation believers experience in Christ, as described in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.<p><b>every living thing that came out of the ark</b><br>The repetition of this phrase emphasizes the continuity of life and God's faithfulness in preserving His creation. It also points to the historical reality of the flood narrative, which is supported by various flood legends across cultures, suggesting a shared memory of a cataclysmic event. The ark's resting place on the mountains of Ararat (<a href="/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>) is a geographical marker that has intrigued archaeologists and explorers seeking evidence of the flood's historicity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.

He preserves what He formed on Day Five and Six (<a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Later Scripture echoes this inclusive care: &#8220;In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the creatures that crawl on the ground&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul reminds us that all creation &#8220;waits in eager expectation&#8221; for full restoration (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-22</a>).<p>The scope is universal&#8212;God&#8217;s rainbow pledge covers the planet and its inhabitants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that was with you</b><p>The phrase anchors the covenant to Noah&#8217;s personal experience:<p>&#8226;

Jesus later pointed to birds as proof of the Father&#8217;s ongoing provision (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The covenant means the skies will never again empty from a global flood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the livestock</b><p>Domesticated animals are named next:<p>&#8226;

Kell in loco). Kalisch thinks the language applies only to the animals of Noah's time, and not to those of a later age, on the ground that "the destiny of the animals is everywhere connected with that of the human race;" but this is equivalent to their being included in the covenant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
