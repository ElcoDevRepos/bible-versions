This moment occurs after the Lord promises Abraham that Sarah will bear a son. Her laughter reflects a common human response to seemingly impossible promises. In biblical context, laughter often signifies doubt or surprise, as seen in other instances like <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>, where Abraham also laughs at the promise of a son. This internal laughter contrasts with the joy and fulfillment that comes later when the promise is fulfilled with the birth of Isaac, whose name means "he laughs."<p><b>saying, &#8220;After I am worn out</b><br>Sarah refers to her advanced age and the physical decline associated with it. At this point, she is around 90 years old, well past the typical childbearing age. This phrase highlights the human perspective of limitations and the natural impossibility of the situation. It underscores the miraculous nature of God's promise, as He often works beyond human limitations to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other biblical narratives like the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a>.<p><b>and my master is old</b><br>Sarah refers to Abraham as "my master," reflecting the cultural norms of respect and hierarchy within marriage during that time. Abraham is about 100 years old, further emphasizing the improbability of the promise from a human standpoint. This phrase also points to the patriarchal structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where the husband was the head of the household. The use of "master" aligns with <a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>, where Sarah's respect for Abraham is commended.<p><b>will I now have this pleasure?&#8221;</b><br>The "pleasure" Sarah refers to is the joy and fulfillment of bearing a child, a significant desire and honor for women in ancient cultures. Childbearing was often seen as a woman's primary role and a source of social status. This question reflects her doubt and surprise at the possibility of experiencing such joy at her age. The fulfillment of this promise is a testament to God's faithfulness and power, as He brings joy and fulfillment in unexpected ways, foreshadowing the joy of salvation and the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, who brings ultimate fulfillment and joy to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham, who is advanced in age and has been barren.

God answers not by scolding but by reaffirming, &#8220;Is anything too difficult for the LORD?&#8221; (18:14). The verse thus invites us to trade hidden doubt for open trust, knowing that the same God who turned Sarah&#8217;s disbelief into joyous laughter still keeps every promise, no matter how unlikely it appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Sarah laughed.</span>--See Note on <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm" title="Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?">Genesis 17:17</a>.
