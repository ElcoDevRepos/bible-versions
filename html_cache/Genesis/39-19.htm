Potiphar's wife falsely accuses Joseph of attempting to assault her. This phrase highlights the power dynamics in ancient Egypt, where a servant's word held little weight against that of a master's wife. The cultural context shows the vulnerability of slaves and servants, who had limited rights and were often at the mercy of their owners' decisions. This situation foreshadows the trials and injustices that Joseph will face, yet it also sets the stage for God's providential plan in his life.<p><b>saying, &#8220;This is what your slave did to me,&#8221;</b><br>The accusation made by Potiphar's wife is a direct attack on Joseph's character and integrity. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such an accusation could lead to severe punishment or even death for a slave. This reflects the broader biblical theme of false accusations and the suffering of the righteous, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like David and Daniel. Joseph's experience here can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also falsely accused and suffered unjustly, yet remained faithful to God's purpose.<p><b>he burned with anger.</b><br>Potiphar's reaction of anger is immediate and intense, reflecting the seriousness of the accusation. In the historical context, a master's honor and household reputation were of utmost importance, and any perceived threat to that could provoke a strong response. This anger, however, does not lead to Joseph's execution, which suggests that Potiphar may have had some doubts about his wife's story or recognized Joseph's integrity. This moment is pivotal in Joseph's life, as it leads to his imprisonment, which ultimately becomes a stepping stone in God's plan for him to rise to power in Egypt. This aligns with the biblical theme of God using trials and suffering to bring about His greater purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, known for his integrity and faithfulness to God.

The verse warns of the destructive power of false testimony and impulsive anger, yet it also sets the stage for God&#8217;s sovereign plan to elevate Joseph despite human injustice, fulfilling promises seen later in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner</span> (literally, <span class="accented">according to these words</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</span> A papyrus consisting of nineteen pages of ten lines of hieratic writing (purchased from Madame D'Orbiney, and presently in the British Museum), belonging probably to the nineteenth dynasty, contains a tale of two brothers, in which incidents occur very similar to those here narrated. While the two are ploughing in the field, the elder sends the younger brother, who appears to have acted in the capacity of general superintendent, to fetch seed from the house. "And the younger brother found the wife of the elder sitting at her toilet.".... "And she spoke to him, saying, What strength there is in thee! Indeed I observe thy vigor every day. Her heart knew him She seized upon him, and said to him, Come, let us lie down for an instant. Better for thee... beautiful clothes." "The youth became like a panther with fury on account of the shameful discourse which she had addressed to him. And she was alarmed exceedingly."... "Her husband returned home at evening, according to his daily wont. He came to the house, and he found his wife lying as if murdered by a ruffian." Inquiring the reason of her distress, he is answered as Potiphar was answered by his deceitful spouse.
