Achbor, meaning "mouse," is a name also found in <a href="/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>, suggesting a possible connection or commonality in naming practices. The death of Baal-hanan marks a transition in leadership, a common theme in Genesis, reflecting the transient nature of human authority compared to God's eternal sovereignty.<p><b>Hadad reigned in his place</b><br>Hadad is a name associated with a storm god in ancient Near Eastern cultures, particularly among the Arameans and Canaanites. This reflects the syncretism present in Edomite culture, where local and foreign deities were often worshipped. The transition of power to Hadad signifies the continuation of Edomite leadership, which is significant in the broader narrative of Israel's relationship with Edom, a nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.<p><b>His city was named Pau</b><br>Pau is a location whose exact identification remains uncertain, though it is believed to be in the region of Edom. The naming of cities after leaders or significant figures was a common practice, reflecting the leader's influence or the city's importance during their reign. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the naming of cities after the patriarchs or significant events.<p><b>and his wife&#8217;s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred</b><br>Mehetabel, meaning "God makes happy," suggests a theophoric element, indicating the presence of Yahweh worship or acknowledgment among the Edomites. Matred, meaning "pushing forward," could imply a lineage of ambition or prominence. The mention of women in genealogies, though less common, highlights their importance in lineage and inheritance, as seen in other biblical accounts like Ruth and Esther.<p><b>the daughter of Me-zahab</b><br>Me-zahab, meaning "waters of gold," could symbolize wealth or prosperity, possibly indicating the family's status or the region's resources. This name might also suggest a connection to the natural resources of Edom, known for its mineral wealth. The genealogical detail underscores the importance of heritage and lineage in biblical narratives, often used to establish legitimacy and divine favor, as seen in the genealogies of Jesus in Matthew and Luke.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal-hanan.htm">Baal-hanan</a></b><br>The son of Achbor, who was a king of Edom.
