Laban's involvement is significant as he later becomes a central figure in the story of Jacob. The mention of both brother and mother highlights the familial structure and decision-making process in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where family consent was crucial in marriage arrangements. This reflects the patriarchal society where male relatives often had a say in such matters.<p><b>&#8220;Let the girl remain with us ten days or so.</b><br>The request for Rebekah to stay for "ten days or so" indicates a customary period for farewells and preparation for a bride's departure. This time would allow the family to celebrate, prepare, and emotionally adjust to the separation. The number ten can symbolize completeness or a full cycle in biblical numerology, suggesting a complete farewell. This request also shows the family's attachment to Rebekah and their desire to delay her departure, which can be seen as a natural emotional response.<p><b>After that, she may go.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "after that, she may go" indicates the family's eventual consent to the marriage and Rebekah's journey to become Isaac's wife. This reflects the cultural practice of arranged marriages, where the bride's family ultimately agrees to the union. The willingness to let her go aligns with God's providential plan, as Rebekah's marriage to Isaac is part of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants. This moment foreshadows the obedience and faith seen in Rebekah, paralleling the journey of faith that believers are called to undertake.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
