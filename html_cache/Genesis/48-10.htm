Similar to Isaac's failing eyesight in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>, this detail underscores the human frailty of the patriarchs. It also sets the stage for the significant blessing that follows, emphasizing the importance of spiritual insight over physical sight. The mention of Israel, formerly Jacob, reflects his transformation and the fulfillment of God's promises to him as the father of the twelve tribes.<p><b>he could hardly see.</b><br>The inability to see clearly is symbolic of the need for spiritual discernment. In biblical literature, physical blindness often parallels spiritual insight, as seen in the story of Saul's conversion in <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>. This moment foreshadows the spiritual blessings that Israel is about to bestow upon Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which will have lasting implications for the tribes of Israel.<p><b>Joseph brought his sons to him,</b><br>Joseph's action of bringing his sons to Israel signifies the continuation of the Abrahamic covenant through the next generation. This act is reminiscent of the patriarchal blessings passed from Abraham to Isaac and from Isaac to Jacob. It also highlights Joseph's role as a preserver of his family's legacy, despite his Egyptian status. The presence of Ephraim and Manasseh in this scene underscores the integration of Joseph's Egyptian-born sons into the Israelite heritage.<p><b>and his father kissed them and embraced them.</b><br>The gesture of kissing and embracing is a sign of affection and acceptance, reflecting the deep familial bonds and the importance of kinship in ancient Near Eastern culture. This act of love and blessing is reminiscent of the prodigal son's return in <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>, where the father embraces his son. It signifies the passing of the covenantal promise and the inclusion of Ephraim and Manasseh into the lineage of Israel, foreshadowing their future roles as tribes within the nation of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob, who is now old and nearly blind, is preparing to bless his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's son, who has risen to a position of power in Egypt, brings his sons to receive a blessing from their grandfather.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim_and_manasseh.htm">Ephraim and Manasseh</a></b><br>The sons of Joseph, who are about to receive a significant blessing from their grandfather, Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where this event takes place, as Jacob and his family have moved there during the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/blessing_ceremony.htm">Blessing Ceremony</a></b><br>A significant event where Jacob imparts a blessing to his grandsons, which has implications for their future and the future of the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_blessings.htm">The Importance of Blessings</a></b><br>In biblical times, blessings were not just well-wishes but carried prophetic and spiritual significance.

The Word is candid about aging: &#8220;When Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>) and &#8220;At that time Eli, whose eyesight had grown dim, was lying in his usual place&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>). God does not hide human frailty, yet He still works powerfully through His servants. Jacob&#8217;s failing eyes contrast sharply with his clear spiritual vision of God&#8217;s promises, much like Paul later says, &#8220;Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226; The Bible presents aging realistically, reminding us that earthly decline does not limit divine purpose.<p>&#8226; Physical weakness can highlight God&#8217;s strength, as seen in the lives of Isaac, Jacob, and even Moses, whose &#8220;eye was not dim&#8221; by God&#8217;s special grace (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He could hardly see</b><p>The repetition underscores how limited Jacob&#8217;s natural vision has become. Yet his insight into God&#8217;s covenant remains vibrant. Soon he will prophetically bless Ephraim and Manasseh, demonstrating that spiritual clarity surpasses physical capacity. This mirrors Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>). Jacob&#8217;s lack of sight will even set the stage for the surprising crossing of his hands (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>), echoing earlier reversals such as when the younger Jacob received Isaac&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/bsb/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>).<p>Key points:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plans are not hindered by human limitation.<p>&#8226; True sight is the ability to perceive God&#8217;s purposes, not merely physical vision (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph brought his sons to him</b><p>Joseph takes deliberate action, honoring both his father and his sons by ushering them into the presence of the patriarch. Earlier, he hastened to his father&#8217;s side when told, &#8220;Your father is ill&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1</a>). This reflects the biblical pattern of bringing children to receive blessing&#8212;parents brought little ones to Jesus so He might touch them (<a href="/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13&#8211;16</a>). Joseph&#8217;s act also fulfills Jacob&#8217;s prior wish: &#8220;I never expected to see your face again, and now God has let me see your offspring as well&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/48-11.htm">Genesis 48:11</a>).<p>Practical observations:<p>&#8226; Spiritual leadership involves guiding the next generation to the place of blessing.<p>&#8226; Family faith is meant to be intergenerational, as seen in Abraham &#8594; Isaac &#8594; Jacob &#8594; Joseph &#8594; Ephraim & Manasseh (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His father kissed them and embraced them</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s affectionate welcome conveys acceptance, love, and covenant inclusion. In <a href="/genesis/45-15.htm">Genesis 45:15</a> Joseph &#8220;kissed all his brothers and wept over them,&#8221; showing reconciliation; here, Jacob&#8217;s embrace marks adoption: &#8220;Now your two sons&#8230; will be reckoned as mine&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>). Similar scenes of paternal compassion appear when the prodigal returns and &#8220;his father&#8230; ran to him, embraced him, and kissed him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>). The gesture readies Ephraim and Manasseh to receive the blessing that will make them tribal patriarchs in Israel (<a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>).<p>Highlights:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant is conveyed in an atmosphere of tangible love, not mere ritual.<p>&#8226; The embrace points to our own adoption in Christ: &#8220;See what great love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God!&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/48-10.htm">Genesis 48:10</a> paints a tender, multi-layered picture: a frail Jacob with fading eyesight, yet vibrant faith; a faithful son bringing his boys for a patriarchal blessing; and an affectionate grandfather embracing the next generation. Physical decline cannot hinder God&#8217;s promises, spiritual vision outshines natural sight, and covenant love flows through family relationships to secure a future for God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">the eyes of Israel were dim</span> (literally, <span class="accented">heavy</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for age</span>, so that he could not see.
