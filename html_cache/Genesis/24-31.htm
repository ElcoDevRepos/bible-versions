This phrase echoes the Abrahamic covenant where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also foreshadows the blessing of the nations through Abraham's lineage, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>said Laban.</b><br>Laban, Rebekah's brother, plays a significant role in the narrative. His character is later developed in Genesis, particularly in his interactions with Jacob. Here, Laban's words and actions are initially hospitable, but his future dealings reveal a more complex character. This introduction sets the stage for understanding his later behavior.<p><b>Why are you standing out here?</b><br>This question underscores the cultural expectation of hospitality in the ancient Near East. It was customary to invite travelers into one's home, especially those who were perceived to be under divine favor. The question also implies urgency and a desire to extend immediate hospitality, reflecting the values of the time.<p><b>I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.</b><br>Laban's preparation indicates readiness and willingness to accommodate both the servant and his animals, highlighting the importance of hospitality. The mention of camels is significant; camels were valuable assets, suggesting Abraham's wealth and the servant's importance. This preparation also symbolizes the provision and care God extends to His people, paralleling how Christ prepares a place for believers (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Brother of Rebekah, son of Bethuel.
