The absence of Abel's response suggests a one-sided dialogue, possibly indicating Cain's deceitful intentions. The narrative follows the offerings made by both brothers, where God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's, leading to Cain's anger and jealousy. This moment foreshadows the tragic outcome of their relationship, reflecting the destructive power of sin and envy.<p><b>&#8220;Let us go out to the field.&#8221;</b><br>The field represents a secluded place away from the presence of others, symbolizing isolation and vulnerability. In ancient agrarian societies, fields were common settings for labor and interaction, but here it becomes a place of betrayal. The invitation to the field may imply premeditation, as Cain seeks a private location to carry out his plan. This setting contrasts with the earlier scene of worship, moving from a place of divine interaction to one of human conflict.<p><b>And while they were in the field,</b><br>The narrative shifts to the field, emphasizing the transition from intention to action. The field, a place of potential growth and life, becomes a site of death and destruction. This setting underscores the theme of sin's pervasive impact on creation, as the ground itself will later be cursed due to Cain's actions. The phrase also highlights the vulnerability of Abel, who is unsuspecting of his brother's intentions.<p><b>Cain rose up against his brother Abel</b><br>Cain's rising up signifies a deliberate and aggressive action, marking the culmination of his internal struggle with sin. This act of violence is the first recorded murder in Scripture, illustrating the devastating consequences of unchecked anger and jealousy. The fraternal relationship between Cain and Abel is shattered, reflecting the broader theme of broken relationships due to sin, which began with Adam and Eve's disobedience.<p><b>and killed him.</b><br>The act of murder is the ultimate expression of Cain's rebellion against God and rejection of his brother. This event foreshadows the pervasive violence that will characterize humanity, as seen in the subsequent narratives of Genesis. Abel's death prefigures the suffering of the righteous, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, culminating in the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, like Abel, was innocent yet suffered at the hands of others. Abel's blood cries out from the ground, symbolizing the need for justice and pointing to the future redemption through Christ's atoning sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, a farmer who becomes the first murderer in biblical history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abel.htm">Abel</a></b><br>The second son of Adam and Eve, a shepherd whose offering was favored by God, leading to his murder by Cain.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>The location where Cain lured Abel to carry out the murder, symbolizing isolation and premeditation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/murder_of_abel.htm">Murder of Abel</a></b><br>The first recorded act of murder in the Bible, highlighting the destructive power of sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>Although not explicitly in this verse, it sets the stage for God's subsequent judgment on Cain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, once it takes root, can lead to devastating actions.

Cain ignores God&#8217;s counsel, lures Abel to an isolated field, rises in violence, and commits the first homicide. The verse exposes how unchecked sin moves from inner desire to outward destruction, warns that secrecy cannot hide guilt from God, and sets the stage for the Bible&#8217;s unfolding contrast between the way of Cain and the way of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Cain talked with Abel his brother.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">And Cain said unto Abel his brother. </span>To this the Samaritan Pentateuch, the LXX., the Syriac, and the Vulg. add, <span class= "ital">"</span>Let us go out into the field;" but neither the Targum of Onkelos nor any Hebrew MS. or authority, except the Jerusalem Targum, give this addition any support. The authority of the versions is, however, very great: first, because Hebrew MSS. are all comparatively modern; and secondly, because all at present known represent only the Recension of the Masorites. Sooner or later some manuscript may be found which will enable scholars to form a critical judgment upon those places where the versions represent a different text. If we could, with the Authorised Version, translate "Cain talked with Abel," this would imply that Cain triumphed for a time over his angry feelings, and resumed friendly intercourse with his brother. But such a rendering is impossible, as also is one that has been suggested, "Cain told it unto Abel his brother" that is, told all that had passed between him and Jehovah. Either, therefore, we must accept the addition of the versions, or regard the passage as at present beyond our powers.<p><span class= "bld">It came to pass, when they were in the field.</span>--The open, uncultivated land, where Abel's flocks would find pasture. We cannot suppose that this murder was premeditated. Cain did not even know what a human death was. But, as Philippson remarks, there was a perpetual struggle between the husbandmen who cultivated fixed plots of ground and the wandering shepherds whose flocks were too prone to stray upon the tilled fields. Possibly Abel's flocks had trespassed on Cain's land, and when he went to remonstrate, his envy was stirred at the sight of his brother's affluence. A quarrel ensued, and Cain, in that fierce anger, to fits of which he was liable (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm" title="But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.">Genesis 4:5</a>), tried to enforce his mastery by blows, and before he well knew what he was doing, he had shed his brother's blood, and stood in terror before the first human corpse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Cain talked with</span> (literally, <span class="accented">said to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his brother.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.); <span class="accented">egrediamur foras</span> (Vulgate). The Samaritan and Syriac versions interpolate to the same effect. The Jerusalem Targum explains - "Cainum cure Abele contendisse de vita aetcrna, de extremo judicio, et providentia divina," inserting a long conversation commencing, "Veni, egrediamur ad superficiem agri;" but the obvious supplement is to be found in the subject matter of the previous verse (Hieronynms, Aben Ezra, Gesenius). It is not against this that it argues too much moral goodness in Cain to suppose that he would tell his younger brother of Jehovah's admonition (Knobel); and it certainly relieves us from the necessity of adding to the moral turpitude of the unhappy fratricide by depicting him as deliberately planning his favored brother's murder, carrying the fell purpose within his guilty bosom, watching his opportunity (Bottcher and Knobel, who substitute <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> he <span class="accented">watched</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">he said</span>), and at last accomplishing his unhallowed purpose by means of treachery. Beyond all question the historian designs to describe not an act of culpable homicide, but a deed of red-handed murder; yet the impression which his language conveys is that of a crime rather suddenly conceived and hurriedly performed than deliberately planned and treacherously executed. <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Cain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7014.htm">Strong's 7014: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cain -- a city in southern Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
