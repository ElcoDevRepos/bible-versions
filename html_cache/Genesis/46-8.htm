The "sons of Israel" refers to the descendants of Jacob, who was renamed Israel after wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). This genealogy is significant as it traces the origins of the tribes of Israel, which play a crucial role in the unfolding narrative of the Bible. The listing of names underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p><b>(Jacob and his descendants)</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, is a patriarch in the biblical narrative. His descendants are central to the story of the Israelites. This parenthetical note clarifies that the list includes not just his immediate sons but also their families. The emphasis on "descendants" highlights the continuation of the covenantal promise through generations. It also sets the stage for the development of the nation of Israel, which will later be enslaved in Egypt and then delivered in the Exodus.<p><b>who went to Egypt</b><br>This phrase marks a pivotal moment in the history of the Israelites. The migration to Egypt was prompted by a severe famine in Canaan (<a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56-57</a>). Joseph, one of Jacob's sons, had risen to power in Egypt and provided a place of refuge for his family. This move to Egypt fulfills God's earlier prophecy to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own and would be enslaved and mistreated for 400 years (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The sojourn in Egypt sets the stage for the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history.<p><b>Reuben, Jacob&#8217;s firstborn</b><br>Reuben is listed first as the eldest son of Jacob. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the firstborn son held a position of privilege and responsibility, often receiving a double portion of the inheritance. However, Reuben lost his birthright due to an indiscretion with his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>; 49:3-4). This mention of Reuben highlights the theme of the reversal of expectations, a recurring motif in the Bible where God's purposes are fulfilled in unexpected ways. Reuben's tribe would later settle on the east side of the Jordan River, playing a significant role in the early history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, originally named Jacob.

Accordingly we find that it is drawn up in a legal manner, representing as sons some who were really grandsons, but who took as heads of families the place usually held by sons. We next find that it represents them as all born in Canaan, not in a natural sense, but as the rightful heirs of the country. Technically every head of a family was born in Canaan, and thus the danger was obviated of an objection to the possession of this rank being accorded to one born in Egypt. As a matter of fact Pharez (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm" title="And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.">Genesis 46:12</a>) was an infant when taken down into Egypt. (See <a href="/genesis/38-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How have you broken forth? this breach be on you: therefore his name was called Pharez.">Genesis 38:29</a>, and Excursus on Chronology of Jacob's life.) It is difficult enough to find time sufficient for his birth in the interval between the return from Padan-Aram, and the descent into Egypt; for the birth of his two sons, Hezron and Hamul, there is no space whatsoever. In <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a> Benjamin has ten sons assigned him, but he was at most about thirty years of age when he went into Egypt, and some of these sons are expressly said elsewhere to have been his grandsons. Commentators have indeed endeavoured to show that Benjamin might have been a few years older, but they do this by upsetting their own conclusions previously arrived at; and there is no process which so legitimately produces scepticism as the re-statement by commentators of the facts so marshalled on each occasion as to suit the apparent exigencies of the passage before them, but in a manner irreconcilable with previous difficulties.<p>The genealogical table of the twelve patriarchs is thrice given in Holy Scripture: here, in Numbers 26, and in 1 Chronicles 1-8.
