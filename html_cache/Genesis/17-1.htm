His age underscores the miraculous nature of God's promises, as he and Sarai were beyond the natural age for childbearing. This sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's covenant, emphasizing that it is by divine intervention rather than human effort.<p><b>the LORD appeared to him</b><br>This appearance of the LORD is a theophany, a direct manifestation of God to a human. Such appearances are significant in the Old Testament, marking pivotal moments in God's dealings with His people. The LORD's appearance to Abram reaffirms the covenant and provides assurance of His presence and promises. This encounter is a precursor to later theophanies, such as those to Moses and the prophets.<p><b>and said, &#8220;I am God Almighty.</b><br>The name "God Almighty" is translated from the Hebrew "El Shaddai," which conveys God's supreme power and sufficiency. This name emphasizes God's ability to fulfill His promises despite human limitations. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and might, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in His creation, sustenance, and governance of the world.<p><b>Walk before Me</b><br>This phrase calls Abram to live a life of faith and obedience in the presence of God. It implies a relationship of accountability and intimacy, where Abram is to conduct his life with an awareness of God's constant presence. This call to "walk" is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to walk in the Spirit and live lives worthy of their calling.<p><b>and be blameless.</b><br>The call to be blameless is an exhortation to moral and spiritual integrity. It does not imply sinlessness but rather a wholehearted devotion to God. This concept is foundational in both the Old and New Testaments, where God's people are called to holiness. It foreshadows the perfect blamelessness found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and enables believers to stand blameless before God through His righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>At this point in Genesis, Abram is ninety-nine years old.

In <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a> it is said, with evident reference to this place, that El shaddai was the name of God revealed to the patriarchs, but that He was not known to them by His name Jehovah. Here, nevertheless, in a passage said by commentators to be Elohistic, we read that "Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said to him I am El shaddai." But the very gist of the passage is the identification of Jehovah and El shaddai, and the great object of the manifest care with which Moses distinguishes the Divine names seems to be to show, that though Jehovah became the special name of Elohim in His covenant relation to Israel after the Exodus, yet that the name was one old and primeval (<a href="/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>), and that the God of revelation, under various titles, was ever one and the same. And so is it now, though we, by following a Jewish superstition, have well-nigh forfeited the use of the name Jehovah, so greatly prized of old (<a href="/genesis/4-1.htm" title="And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.">Genesis 4:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Abram was ninety years old and nine</span> - consequently an interval of thirteen years had elapsed since the birth of Ishmael; the long delay on the part of God being probably designed as chastisement for Abram's second nuptials (Calvin), and at least corresponding with Abram's undue haste (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">the Lord appeared to Abram</span> - lest he should regard Ishmael's birth as a complete fulfillment of the promise (Menochius), and be satisfied with Hagar's child as the expected seed (Calvin) - <span class="cmt_word">and said to him, I am the Almighty God</span> - <span class="accented">El Shaddai</span>, found six times in Genesis and thirty-one times in Job, composed of El, God, and <span class="accented">Shaddai</span>; not a <span class="accented">nomen compositum</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;</span> = <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>) signifying <span class="accented">qui sufficiens est</span> (Aquinas, Symmachus, Theodoret, Saadias, Maimonides, Calvin), but either a <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span>., from the singular <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, powerful - root <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to be strong (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Wordsworth), or a singular from the same root with the substantive termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;</span>, as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, the festal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, the old man, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, the thorn-grown (Keil, Oehler, Lange); descriptive of God as revealing himself violently in his might, hence correctly rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span> by the LXX. in Job (Oehler); distinguishing Jehovah, the God of salvation, from Elohim, the God who creates nature so that it is and supports it that it may stand, as "<span class="accented">the</span> God who compels nature to do what is contrary to itself, and subdues it to bow and minister to grace" (Delitzsch); characterizing Jehovah the covenant God, "as possessing the power to realize his promises, even when the order of nature presented no prospect of their fulfillment, and the powers of nature were insufficient to secure it" (Keil); perhaps, like Elohim and Adonai, one of the world-wide titles of the Most High since it was known to Balaam (<a href="/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16</a>), and is constantly used in Job ('Speaker's Commentary'). Said in <a href="/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2, 3</a> to have been the name by which God was known to the patriarchs, it is regarded by the partitionists as characteristic of the Elohist (Tuch, Blcek, Colenso, Davidson, Ewald), and accordingly to that writer the present chapter is assigned, and the Jehovah of this verse expiated as an alteration of the original Elohist's narrative; but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of this criticism lurks in the identification of El-Shaddai with Elohim, whereas it is not Elohim, but Jehovah, who reveals himself as E1 Shaddai not alone in the Pentateuch, but in the historical and prophetical books as well (cf. <a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20, 21</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Keil's Introduction, pt. &sect; 2; div. 1. &sect; 25). <span class="cmt_word">Walk before me</span>.
