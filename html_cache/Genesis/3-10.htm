The "voice" of God is often associated with divine communication and authority throughout Scripture. In the context of Genesis, the garden represents a place of intimate fellowship between God and humanity. The garden of Eden is traditionally located in the region of Mesopotamia, though its exact location is unknown. Theologically, this moment marks a shift from harmony to estrangement due to sin. The voice of God in the garden can be seen as a precursor to the Word made flesh, Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<p><b>he replied,</b><br>Adam's response to God highlights the personal relationship between the Creator and His creation. This interaction sets a precedent for the dialogue between God and humans throughout the Bible. It also underscores the accountability of humanity to God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>and I was afraid because I was naked;</b><br>Fear enters the human experience as a direct result of sin. Before the fall, Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed, symbolizing innocence and purity. The realization of nakedness signifies a loss of innocence and the onset of guilt and shame. This fear contrasts with the perfect love described in 1 <a href="/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>, which casts out fear. Theologically, this moment foreshadows the need for a covering, ultimately fulfilled in Christ's atonement.<p><b>so I hid myself.</b><br>Adam's attempt to hide from God illustrates the futility of escaping divine presence, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>. This act of hiding represents the human tendency to avoid confronting sin and guilt. It also signifies the separation between God and humanity that sin causes, a separation that is reconciled through Jesus Christ, who seeks and saves the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). The hiding can be seen as a type of spiritual death, which is overcome by the resurrection life offered in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, living in the Garden of Eden.

Adam unmistakably recognizes the same voice that had daily brought delight (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), confirming ongoing, personal fellowship between Creator and creature.<p>&#8226; God initiates the encounter; humanity never has to guess whether He will speak (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>; <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing the voice in a specific place (&#8220;in the garden&#8221;) underlines that sin has not eliminated God&#8217;s willingness to meet mankind where we live (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment shows how revelation precedes repentance: God speaks first, then Adam responds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I was afraid</b><p>&#8226; Fear enters the human experience only after sin, replacing the peace described before the fall (<a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>; <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin-born fear distorts God&#8217;s character&#8212;Adam expects punishment from the One who made him for fellowship (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; While reverent awe is healthy (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), this dread is different: it drives Adam away rather than nearer (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode reveals that broken intimacy with God is felt first emotionally, then relationally, then physically.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I was naked</b><p>&#8226; Nakedness was once innocent; now it signals guilt and vulnerability (<a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a> vs. 3:7).<p>&#8226; Adam&#8217;s confession shows he understands that nothing is hidden from God (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Shame is the inward confirmation that something is wrong on the inside, not merely on the surface (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The need for covering foreshadows God&#8217;s later provision of garments made from a sacrifice (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>), pointing to the ultimate covering in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so I hid myself</b><p>&#8226; The instinct to hide from God illustrates how sin twists logic&#8212;darkness cannot conceal us from the One who is Light (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-made hiding places (trees, excuses, denial) never resolve guilt; they only postpone accountability (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this pattern when describing humanity&#8217;s flight from the light (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>), yet offers the remedy by drawing all people to Himself (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s gracious question in the next verse (&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;) proves He seeks sinners before sinners ever seek Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/3-10.htm">Genesis 3:10</a> records the first human words after the fall, exposing a chain reaction: God speaks, sin generates fear, fear uncovers shame, shame produces hiding. The verse reveals the immediate consequences of rebellion&#8212;broken fellowship, distorted perception of God, and futile attempts at self-protection. Yet even in Adam&#8217;s confession we see hope: he still hears God, still answers, and prepares the way for God&#8217;s redemptive initiative. The same Lord who sought Adam in the garden now seeks us in Christ, replacing fear with love, shame with righteousness, and hiding with restored fellowship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Your voice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1445;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
