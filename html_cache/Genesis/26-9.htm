This encounter mirrors a previous event with Abraham and Abimelech, suggesting a recurring theme of divine protection and human fear. The Philistines were a significant presence in the region, often interacting with the patriarchs.<p><b>&#8220;So she is really your wife!</b><br>This revelation highlights the importance of marriage covenants in ancient Near Eastern culture. The sanctity of marriage was recognized even by those outside the covenant community, indicating a universal understanding of marital fidelity. The situation underscores the potential consequences of deception.<p><b>How could you say, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's deception echoes Abraham's earlier actions in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12 and 20</a>, showing a pattern of fear-driven decisions among the patriarchs. This repetition emphasizes human frailty and the tendency to rely on self-preservation rather than trust in God's promises. It also reflects the cultural practice of identifying women as sisters to protect them, albeit through deceit.<p><b>Isaac replied, &#8220;Because I thought I might die on account of her.&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's fear for his life reveals the perceived threat from foreign rulers and the vulnerability of sojourners in a foreign land. This response shows a lack of faith in God's protection, contrasting with the divine assurances given to Isaac. It also foreshadows the ultimate protection and deliverance found in Christ, who faced death for the sake of His bride, the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.
