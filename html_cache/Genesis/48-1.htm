In the ancient Near Eastern context, family ties were crucial, and the presence of a son at a father's deathbed was a sign of respect and duty. This moment foreshadows the impending death of Jacob, a patriarch whose life and legacy are central to the narrative of Israel.<p><b>So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</b><br>Joseph's decision to bring his sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, is significant. It reflects the importance of family blessings and the transmission of covenant promises. Manasseh and Ephraim, born in Egypt, represent the next generation of Israelites.

In this chapter a still more important matter is settled; for Jacob, exercising to the full his rights as the father and head of the Israelite race, and moved thereto both by his love for Rachel, the high rank of Joseph, and also by the spirit of prophecy, bestows upon Joseph two tribes. No authority less than that of Jacob would have sufficed for this, and therefore the grant is carefully recorded, and holds its right place immediately before the solemn blessing given by the dying patriarch to his sons. The occasion of Joseph's visit was the sickness of his father, who not merely felt generally that his death was near, as in <a href="/genesis/47-29.htm" title="And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:">Genesis 47:29</a>, but was now suffering from some malady; and Joseph naturally took with him his two sons, that they might see and be blessed by their grandfather before his death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass after these things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the events recorded in the preceding chapter, and in particular after the arrangements which had been made for Jacob s funeral), <span class="cmt_word">that one told Joseph</span>, - the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> is here used impersonally, or passively, for "<span class="accented">one</span> told," or "it was told," to Joseph (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">munciatum est</span>; Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, <span class="accented">et alii</span>); or probably emphatically, by way of calling attention to the circumstance - denoting perhaps a special messenger (Tayler Lewis). <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thy father is sick</span>.
