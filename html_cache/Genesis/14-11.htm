The rebellion of these cities in the thirteenth year led to the punitive campaign by the four kings. The seizing of goods indicates a common practice in ancient warfare where victors would plunder the defeated cities, taking valuable resources and wealth. This act of seizing goods highlights the vulnerability and moral decline of Sodom and Gomorrah, which is later emphasized in their destruction in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The historical context of this event is supported by archaeological findings that suggest the existence of city-states in the region during this period, often engaged in conflicts over resources.<p><b>and all their food,</b><br>The mention of food emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the plunder. In ancient times, food was a critical resource, and its seizure would have left the cities in a dire situation, potentially leading to famine. This detail underscores the severity of the defeat and the desperation that would follow for the inhabitants. The loss of food also symbolizes the stripping away of sustenance and security, which can be seen as a judgment against the cities' wickedness. This act of taking all their food can be paralleled with other biblical instances where God allows enemies to strip away resources as a form of judgment or testing, such as in the book of Judges.<p><b>and they went on their way.</b><br>This phrase indicates the departure of the four kings after their victory and plundering. It suggests a sense of finality and completion of their mission. The phrase can also imply a temporary triumph, as the narrative continues with Abram's intervention to rescue Lot, which ultimately leads to the kings' defeat. This departure sets the stage for Abram's role as a deliverer, prefiguring Christ's role as a redeemer who rescues His people from bondage. The swift exit of the kings without further engagement with the cities may also reflect the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate sovereignty of God over human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_kings.htm">Four Kings</a></b><br>These are the kings of Shinar, Ellasar, Elam, and Goiim, who formed an alliance to wage war against the cities of the plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Two cities located in the plain of Jordan, known for their wickedness and later destruction by God.
