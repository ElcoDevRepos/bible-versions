This approach shows their fear and uncertainty about Joseph's reaction after Jacob's death. It highlights the ongoing tension and lack of trust within the family, despite Joseph's previous forgiveness. The act of sending a message rather than speaking directly can be seen as a strategic move to ensure their safety and to appeal to Joseph's sense of duty and family loyalty.<p><b>&#8220;Before he died,</b><br>This phrase sets the timing of the command, emphasizing the importance of a patriarch's last words in ancient Near Eastern culture. A father's dying wishes were considered binding and carried significant weight, often seen as a final testament or blessing. This context underscores the seriousness with which the brothers present their message, attempting to invoke Jacob's authority to influence Joseph's actions.<p><b>your father commanded,</b><br>The use of "your father" rather than "our father" may be an attempt to personalize the message and appeal to Joseph's filial duty. It suggests a strategic emphasis on Joseph's relationship with Jacob, possibly to remind him of his father's love and expectations. This phrase also reflects the hierarchical family structure, where the father's commands were expected to be obeyed by all family members. The invocation of Jacob's command serves to legitimize the brothers' request and to remind Joseph of the family unity and reconciliation that Jacob desired.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The eleventh son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt and saved his family from famine.

Their sending a message to him is an ironic reversal: the rescued now appeal to their rescuer.<p>- This mirrors a broader biblical pattern&#8212;people in need approach the one exalted by God (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a> speaks of every knee bowing to Christ; here, every brother bends toward Joseph).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>- The message opens with reported speech, hinting that they craft their words carefully, hoping to sway Joseph&#8217;s emotions.<p>- Their speech stands against Joseph&#8217;s previous assurances of forgiveness (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5-8</a>). Human fear often re-litigates what grace has already settled.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> reminds that &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221;; the brothers hope their carefully composed words will do just that.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Before he died</b><p>- Invoking a deathbed scene instantly adds solemnity; final words carry weight throughout Scripture (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6-8</a>).<p>- Jacob&#8217;s own last acts included blessings and burial instructions (<a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28-33</a>), so the brothers know Joseph will take anything &#8220;before he died&#8221; seriously.<p>- <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> underlines the finality of death; no further clarifications can come from Jacob, so the brothers&#8217; claim is unverifiable&#8212;illustrating how fear can tempt even redeemed people toward half-truths.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your father commanded</b><p>- By calling Jacob &#8220;your father,&#8221; they subtly appeal to Joseph&#8217;s filial loyalty; it is not merely their father, but his.<p>- Honoring a father&#8217;s command is divinely mandated (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The brothers lean on that commandment to obligate Joseph.<p>- Throughout Genesis, patriarchal commands shape destiny&#8212;Abraham sending a servant for Isaac&#8217;s wife (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2-4</a>), Isaac directing Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3-4</a>). The brothers hope the pattern holds: Joseph will obey Jacob just as earlier generations obeyed their fathers.<p>- Yet Joseph has already shown he lives by a higher principle of grace (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Obedience to Jacob will align with, not override, Joseph&#8217;s God-given perspective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/50-16.htm">Genesis 50:16</a> captures a moment where guilt collides with grace. Joseph&#8217;s brothers, still haunted by old sins, seek safety behind a messenger and a purported deathbed command. Each phrase reveals their anxiety: sending word, targeting Joseph&#8217;s authority, crafting speech, invoking Jacob&#8217;s final hours, and leaning on paternal commandment. In contrast, Joseph&#8217;s previous forgiveness and God&#8217;s providential plan remain unchanged. The verse reminds us that human hearts often struggle to rest in grace, yet God&#8217;s redemptive purposes stand firm, inviting us to exchange fear for confident trust in His settled forgiveness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16, 17) <span class= "bld">Thy father did command . . . --</span>Many Jewish expositors consider that this was untrue, and that Jacob was never made aware of the fact that his brethren had sold Joseph into slavery.

But besides the father's authority the message brings a twofold influence to bear upon Joseph: for first it reminds him that they were his brethren, and next, that they shared the same religious faith--no slight band of union in a country where the religion was so unlike their own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (under these erroneous though not unnatural apprehensions) <span class="cmt_word">they sent a messenger unto Joseph</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">they charged Joseph, i.e.</span> they deputed one of their number (possibly Benjamin) to carry their desires to Joseph - <span class="cmt_word">saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying</span> (though not recorded, the circumstance here mentioned may have been historically true), <span class="cmt_word">So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil</span> (nothing is more inherently probable than that the good man on his death-bed did request his sons to beg their brother's pardon): <span class="cmt_word">and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father</span>. Joseph's brethren in these words at once evince the depth of their humility, the sincerity of their repentance, and the genuineness of their religion.
