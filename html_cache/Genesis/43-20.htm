In the ancient Near Eastern culture, showing respect to those in authority was crucial, especially in foreign lands. The use of "sir" indicates their recognition of the steward's position and their desire to find favor. This humility can be contrasted with their earlier attitudes when dealing with Joseph as a young man, highlighting a transformation in their character.<p><b>"we really did come down here the first time to buy food."</b><br>The brothers are referring to their initial journey to Egypt due to the severe famine in Canaan, which is documented in <a href="/genesis/42.htm">Genesis 42</a>. This statement is part of their defense against the accusation of being spies. The famine was widespread, affecting not only Egypt but also surrounding regions, forcing many to seek provisions from Egypt, where Joseph, unbeknownst to them, had stored grain. This situation fulfills the earlier dreams of Joseph, where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his, symbolizing their dependence on him. The phrase also underscores the theme of God's providence, as He uses the famine to bring about reconciliation and the preservation of Jacob's family, which is central to the unfolding of the Abrahamic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is in charge of selling grain during the famine.
