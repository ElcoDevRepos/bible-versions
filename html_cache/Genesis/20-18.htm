Sarah, Abraham's wife, is a key figure in God's covenant with Abraham, as she is to be the mother of Isaac, the child of promise (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>). Her presence in Abimelech's household, due to Abraham's deception, creates a situation that threatens the fulfillment of God's promise. This incident underscores the importance of Sarah in God's plan and the lengths to which God will go to protect her. The protection of Sarah also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>the LORD had completely closed all the wombs</b><br>This divine intervention demonstrates God's sovereignty and power over human fertility, a recurring theme in the Bible. The closing of the wombs is a direct act of God, emphasizing His control over life and His ability to intervene in human affairs. This act serves as a protective measure for Sarah, ensuring that no child could be born to her while she was in Abimelech's household, thus preserving the integrity of the promised lineage through Isaac. This theme of God opening and closing wombs is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the stories of Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>) and Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>).<p><b>in Abimelech&#8217;s household</b><br>Abimelech, the king of Gerar, is a significant figure in this narrative. His household represents a foreign power that unknowingly comes into conflict with God's covenant plan. The mention of his household indicates that the impact of God's intervention was widespread, affecting not just Abimelech but all those under his authority. This incident takes place in the region of Gerar, which is located in the Negev, south of Canaan. The historical and geographical context highlights the interactions between the patriarchs and the surrounding nations, illustrating the broader narrative of God's people living among and sometimes in conflict with other cultures. The story of Abimelech also parallels later interactions between Israel and foreign kings, such as Pharaoh in Egypt, where God intervenes to protect His people and His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who intervenes in human affairs, demonstrating His power and authority over life and fertility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The king of Gerar, who unknowingly took Sarah into his household, believing her to be Abraham's sister.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>Abraham's wife, whose presence in Abimelech's house led to divine intervention due to the potential threat to God's covenant promise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who, out of fear, misrepresented his relationship with Sarah, leading to the events in Gerar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gerar.htm">Gerar</a></b><br>The region where Abimelech ruled and where the events of <a href="/bsb/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a> took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>This passage underscores God's ultimate control over human affairs, including life and fertility.

Here it tells us God&#8217;s intervention was not random.<p>&#8226; By linking the healing of the women in v. 17 to the closing of their wombs in v. 18, the text underscores that both the affliction and its removal come from the same sovereign LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On account of Abraham&#8217;s wife Sarah</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant promise to bless the world through Abraham and Sarah&#8217;s offspring (<a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-19</a>) made her marriage exclusive and inviolable.<p>&#8226; Abimelech&#8217;s taking of Sarah&#8212;even in ignorance&#8212;threatened the purity of that promise. Compare the earlier incident in Egypt where the LORD &#8220;struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram&#8217;s wife Sarai&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse highlights Sarah&#8217;s unique role; by protecting her, God guards the lineage that will lead to Isaac, then to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD had completely closed</b><p>&#8226; Fertility is in God&#8217;s hand. &#8220;He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyful mother of children&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/113-9.htm">Psalm 113:9</a>). He also withholds it when necessary (<a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The adverb &#8220;completely&#8221; (rendered &#8220;had completely closed&#8221; in) emphasizes thoroughness.
