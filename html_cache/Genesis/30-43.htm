This prosperity is not merely material but also a sign of divine favor. The Hebrew word for "prosperous" implies abundance and success, reflecting God's covenantal faithfulness. Jacob's wealth is a result of his hard work and God's intervention, as seen in the previous verses where God blesses his selective breeding techniques. This prosperity also foreshadows the future wealth and growth of the nation of Israel.<p><b>He owned large flocks,</b><br>Flocks were a primary measure of wealth in the ancient Near East, indicating Jacob's significant economic status. Sheep and goats were essential for clothing, food, and trade. Jacob's large flocks signify God's blessing and the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham about his descendants being numerous and prosperous (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). This also sets the stage for the future wealth of the tribes of Israel, who will inherit the land flowing with milk and honey.<p><b>maidservants and menservants,</b><br>The mention of servants highlights the patriarchal and hierarchical nature of ancient society. Servants were integral to managing large households and estates. This reflects Jacob's status as a wealthy patriarch, similar to Abraham and Isaac, who also had numerous servants (<a href="/genesis/24-35.htm">Genesis 24:35</a>). The presence of servants indicates the fulfillment of God's promise to make Jacob a great nation, as a large household was a microcosm of a nation.<p><b>and camels and donkeys.</b><br>Camels and donkeys were valuable assets for transportation and trade, especially in the arid regions of the Near East. Camels, in particular, were considered luxury animals, indicating Jacob's substantial wealth. The ownership of these animals suggests Jacob's ability to engage in long-distance trade, enhancing his economic influence. This wealth and mobility foreshadow the future journeys of the Israelites and their eventual exodus from Egypt, as well as the spread of the Gospel in the New Testament, where mobility played a crucial role in the dissemination of the message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

It was not luck or mere human ingenuity that multiplied Jacob&#8217;s assets&#8212;God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness was at work, exactly as He had promised in <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a> and later affirmed in 31:11-13.<p>&#8226; Earlier the Lord had enlarged Isaac&#8217;s wealth (<a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12-14</a>) and had already begun prospering Jacob while he was still in Laban&#8217;s household (<a href="/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>). This verse shows the same pattern: when God pledges blessing, He delivers (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;exceedingly prosperous&#8221; underscores abundance beyond natural expectation, mirroring the promise to Abraham that his descendants would be blessed and become a blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>; 24:35).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He owned large flocks</b><p>&#8220;and he owned large flocks,&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>b)<p>&#8226; In the ancient Near East, flocks&#8212;sheep and goats&#8212;were primary indicators of wealth. Like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2, 5</a>) and Job (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), Jacob&#8217;s livestock testified to divine favor.<p>&#8226; Flocks meant food, clothing, trade, and sacrificial animals (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>). Their multiplication foreshadowed Israel&#8217;s later national prosperity described in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13-14 and 28</a>:4.<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s success, gained while serving an often-unfair employer, reminds believers that God can prosper His people even in adverse circumstances (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>maidservants and menservants</b><p>&#8220;maidservants and menservants,&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>c)<p>&#8226; A sizable household staff signified enduring wealth (<a href="/genesis/24-35.htm">Genesis 24:35</a>; 26:14). Abraham once mustered 318 trained servants to rescue Lot (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>), indicating competence and loyalty that mirrored their master&#8217;s stature.<p>&#8226; Possessing servants required responsible stewardship (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>). Jacob&#8217;s later instructions to send gifts ahead to Esau (<a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-16</a>) reveal he managed people as well as possessions.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the scene anticipates Israel&#8217;s expansion from one man&#8217;s household to a nation equipped for God&#8217;s service (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>; 19:5-6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and camels and donkeys</b><p>&#8220;and camels and donkeys.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>d)<p>&#8226; Camels were long-distance freight carriers, valuable for trade caravans (<a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>; 37:25). Donkeys provided local transport and agricultural support (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>). Together they formed the ancient equivalent of a trucking fleet.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s fortunes likewise included abundant camels and donkeys (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>; 42:12), reinforcing the biblical motif that God can restore and enrich beyond measure.<p>&#8226; These animals also enhanced mobility. When God later calls Jacob to return to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3, 17</a>-18), he has the means to obey promptly&#8212;an encouraging picture that divine provision equips God&#8217;s people to follow His directives (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a> caps the story of Jacob&#8217;s years with Laban by spotlighting tangible, overflowing blessing&#8212;flocks, servants, camels, and donkeys.

Wool, as the chief material for clothing, is a very valuable commodity in the East, and by the sale of it Jacob would obtain means for the purchase of male and female servants and camels.
