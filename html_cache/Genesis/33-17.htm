Succoth, meaning "booths" or "shelters," is located east of the Jordan River. This movement signifies a transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a more settled existence. The choice of Succoth may reflect Jacob's desire for a temporary respite after his long journey and the emotional encounter with Esau.<p><b>where he built a house for himself</b><br>Building a house indicates a shift from Jacob's previous life as a wanderer. This act of settling down suggests a period of stability and security. In the broader biblical narrative, building a house can symbolize establishing a legacy or a new beginning, as seen in David's desire to build a house for the Lord (2 Samuel 7).<p><b>and shelters for his livestock</b><br>The construction of shelters for livestock highlights Jacob's wealth and the importance of his possessions. Livestock were a primary measure of wealth and sustenance in ancient times. This action also reflects Jacob's responsibility and care for his resources, ensuring their protection and well-being.<p><b>that is why the place was called Succoth</b><br>The naming of Succoth is directly tied to Jacob's actions. In biblical tradition, naming places often commemorates significant events or divine encounters, as seen with Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>).

The verse reassures believers that every stop on the journey&#8212;whether brief or extended&#8212;falls under the Lord&#8217;s sovereign, providing hand, inviting us to trust His timing, steward His gifts, and remember His goodness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">JACOB'S SETTLEMENT IN CANAAN.--DINAH'S WRONG, AND THE FIERCE VENGEANCE OF SIMEON AND LEVI</span> (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm" title="And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.">Genesis 33:17</a> to <a href="/genesis/34-31.htm" title="And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?">Genesis 34:31</a>.).<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Succoth.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">booths. </span>There are two claimants for identification with Jacob's Succoth, of which the one is in the tribe of Gad, on the east of the Jordan, in the corner formed by that river and the Jabbok; the other is the place still called Sak-t, on the west of the Jordan, but as it lies ten miles to the north. of the junction of the Jordan and Jabbok, it is not likely that Jacob would go so far out of his way.<p><span class= "bld">Jacob . . . built him an house, and made booths for his cattle.</span>--This is something quite unusual, as the cattle in Palestine remain in the open air all the year round, and the fact that the place retained the name of the booths shows that it was noticed as remarkable. But the fact, coupled with the right translation of <a href="/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a>, is a strong but undesigned testimony to the truth of the narrative. Jacob had been pursued by Laban, and suffered much from anxiety and the labour attendant upon the hurried removal of so large a household. Delivered from danger in the rear, he has to face a greater danger in front, and passes many days and nights in terror. At last Esau is close at hand, and having done all that man could do, he stays behind to recover himself, and prepare for the dreaded meeting next day. But instead of a few calm restful hours he has to wrestle fiercely all night, and when at sunrise he moves. forward he finds that he has sprained his hip. He gets through the interview with Esan with much feeling, agitated alternately by fear, and hope, and joy, enduring all the while his bodily pain as best he can, and then, delivered from all danger, he breaks down. The word "journeyed" simply means that he broke up his camp from the high ground where he had met his brother, and went into the corner close by, where the two rivers would both protect him and provide his cattle with water and herbage. And there he not only put up some protection, probably wattled enclosures made with branches of trees, for his cattle, but built a house for himself--something, that is, more solid than a tent: and there he lay until he was healed of his lameness. The strained sinew would require some months of perfect rest before Jacob could move about; but it was healed, for "Jacob came whole and sound to the city of Shechem."
