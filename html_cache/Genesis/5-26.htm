Lamech, Methuselah's son, is significant as the father of Noah, who plays a crucial role in the biblical narrative of the Flood. This genealogy underscores the importance of family lineage in the biblical text, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a righteous line. The name Lamech may mean "powerful" or "strong," reflecting the hope placed in him by his father Methuselah.<p><b>Methuselah lived 782 years</b><br>Methuselah is noted for his extraordinary lifespan, the longest recorded in the Bible, living a total of 969 years. His long life is often seen as a symbol of God's patience and mercy, as his death is traditionally understood to coincide with the year of the Flood. The longevity of Methuselah and others in this genealogy reflects the pre-Flood conditions described in Genesis, where human lifespans were significantly longer. This extended lifespan may also serve as a literary device to bridge the gap between Adam and Noah, maintaining continuity in the narrative.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Methuselah, like many of the patriarchs, had a large family, which was typical in the ancient Near Eastern context. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests the proliferation of humanity during this period, fulfilling God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). While the focus is on the line leading to Noah, the inclusion of other children highlights the broader human family and the spread of humanity across the earth. This detail also underscores the idea that the biblical genealogies are selective, focusing on the line of promise rather than providing a comprehensive family tree.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/methuselah.htm">Methuselah</a></b><br>Known as the longest-lived human in the Bible, Methuselah is a significant figure in the genealogy from Adam to Noah.

Genealogies in Scripture are not random lists; they trace God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p>&#8226; The line from Adam to Noah flows through Methuselah to Lamech, then to Noah (<a href="/genesis/5-28.htm">Genesis 5:28&#8211;29</a>), underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve a righteous lineage, just as He later narrows the line to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;3</a>) and ultimately to Christ (<a href="/luke/3-36.htm">Luke 3:36&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting Lamech, the text signals that something significant is coming&#8212;namely Noah and the Flood narrative (<a href="/bsb/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6&#8211;9</a>). Much like the birth notices of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) or Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>), this short clause prepares us for a major movement in redemptive history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Methuselah lived 782 years</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;Methuselah lived 782 years&#8230;&#8221;. These numbers are presented as literal, not symbolic.<p>&#8226; The long lifespans of <a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> stand between creation and the Flood, an era when the earth was still relatively &#8220;very good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>) and human mutation load minimal. After the Flood, lifespans drop sharply (<a href="/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10&#8211;32</a>), a pattern consistent with God&#8217;s later statement, &#8220;My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Methuselah, at 969 years total (<a href="/genesis/5-27.htm">Genesis 5:27</a>), testifies to God&#8217;s patience. According to the timeline, his death coincides with or just precedes the year of the Flood, illustrating <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>: &#8220;The Lord is patient&#8230; not wanting anyone to perish.&#8221; His long life serves as a living billboard of divine longsuffering before judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And had other sons and daughters</b><p>The verse concludes, &#8220;&#8230;and had other sons and daughters&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Scripture doesn&#8217;t name these children, yet their mention affirms the fruitfulness mandate of <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. Humanity is expanding, exactly as God intended.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows that the chosen line (in this case through Lamech) is set apart within a real, bustling family. This theme repeats with Abraham&#8217;s additional sons (<a href="/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1&#8211;6</a>) and David&#8217;s many children (<a href="/2_samuel/5-13.htm">2 Samuel 5:13&#8211;16</a>). God selectively records certain descendants while still acknowledging the broader family context.<p>&#8226; Practically, it reminds us that every believer&#8217;s story fits into a larger community. Even when only a few names are spotlighted, God sees the full picture (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/5-26.htm">Genesis 5:26</a> spotlights Methuselah&#8217;s life after fathering Lamech, stressing three truths: the intentionality of God&#8217;s genealogies, the literal reality of pre-Flood longevity that displays God&#8217;s patience, and the broader family context that supports His redemptive plan. Far from a throwaway footnote, the verse weaves another thread in Scripture&#8217;s seamless tapestry, guiding our eyes toward Noah, the Flood, and ultimately the Savior who would come through this same line.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/5-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had become the father of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124;
