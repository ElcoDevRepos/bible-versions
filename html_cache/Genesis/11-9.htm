This etymology is significant as it directly relates to the event of God confusing the languages. Babel is often associated with Babylon, a city that later becomes a symbol of human pride and rebellion against God. The Tower of Babel narrative sets the stage for the recurring biblical theme of human attempts to reach divine status, which is consistently thwarted by God. This theme is echoed in the story of Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon in the Book of Daniel and the symbolic Babylon in Revelation.<p><b>for there the LORD confused the language of the whole world</b><br>The confusion of languages is a divine intervention to halt the unified rebellion of humanity. This act of God serves as a judgment against human pride and disobedience. The phrase "the whole world" emphasizes the universality of the event, affecting all of humanity. This confusion leads to the diversification of languages and cultures, which is a key element in the development of human civilization. Theologically, this event underscores God's sovereignty over human affairs and His ability to disrupt human plans. It also foreshadows the reversal of this confusion at Pentecost in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit enables the apostles to speak in various tongues, symbolizing the reunification of humanity under the Gospel.<p><b>and from that place the LORD scattered them over the face of all the earth</b><br>The scattering of people is both a judgment and a fulfillment of God's command to "fill the earth" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). This dispersal leads to the formation of nations and the spread of different cultures and languages. Theologically, it highlights the consequences of sin, as human unity is broken due to rebellion against God. This scattering also sets the stage for God's redemptive plan through Abraham, whose descendants are called to be a blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The scattering and subsequent gathering of nations is a recurring biblical motif, culminating in the eschatological vision of all nations worshiping God together, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babel.htm">Babel</a></b><br>The city where humanity attempted to build a tower to reach the heavens, symbolizing human pride and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The divine being who intervened to confuse the language of the people, demonstrating His sovereignty and authority over human affairs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_confusion_of_language.htm">The Confusion of Language</a></b><br>A divine act that disrupted human unity and ambition, leading to the scattering of people across the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scattering_of_nations.htm">The Scattering of Nations</a></b><br>The dispersal of humanity across the globe, resulting in the formation of diverse cultures and languages.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tower_of_babel.htm">The Tower of Babel</a></b><br>The structure that humanity endeavored to build, representing their desire to make a name for themselves apart from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>The account of Babel warns against the sin of pride and the desire to elevate oneself above God.

It is strange that any one should have derived the word from Bab-Bel, <span class= "ital">the gate of Bel, </span>for there is no trace that the second <span class= "ital">b </span>was ever doubled; moreover, Bel is for Baal; and though we Westerns omit the strong guttural, because we cannot pronounce it, the Orientals would preserve it. <span class= "ital">El </span>is the regular Semitic word for God--in Assyrian, <span class= "ital">Ili; </span>in Arabic, <span class= "ital">Ilah; </span>in Syriac, <span class= "ital">Moho. </span>So far from diminishing, this increases the force of the Scriptural derivation. Man calls his projected city Bab-el, <span class= "ital">the gate</span>--that is, the court--<span class= "ital">of God; </span>God calls it Babble; for in all languages indistinct and confused speech is represented by the action of the lips in producing the sound of <span class= "ital">b. </span>The exact Hebrew word for this was <span class= "ital">balbal</span>--the Greek verb, <span class= "ital">bambaino; </span>the Latin, <span class= "ital">balbutio; </span>and a man who stammered was called <span class= "ital">balbus. </span>The town, then, keeps-its first name, but with a contemptuous meaning attached to it; just as Nabal (<a href="/1_samuel/25-25.htm" title="Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.">1Samuel 25:25</a>) may really have had his name from the <span class= "ital">nabla, </span>or harp, but from the day that his wife gave it a contemptuous meaning Nabal has signified only folly.<p>The Babylonian legends are in remarkable agreement with the Hebrew narrative. They represent the building of the tower as impious, and as a sort of Titanic attempt to scale the heavens. This means that the work was one of vast purpose; for there is something in the human mind which attaches the idea of impiety to all stupendous undertakings, and the popular feeling is always one of rejoicing at their failure. The gods therefore destroy at night what the builders had wrought by day; and finally, Bel, "the father of the gods," confounds their languages. It is remarkable that the very word used here is <span class= "ital">balai </span>(or perhaps <span class= "ital">balah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and thus the meaning of "confusion" would attach to the word equally in the Assyrian as in the Hebrew language (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 166).<p>One question remains: Was the tower of Babel the temple of Bel destroyed by Xerxes, and which was situated in the centre of Babylon? or was it the tower of Borsippa, the site of which was in one of the suburbs, about two miles to the south? This tower was the observatory of the Chaldean astronomers, and its name, according to Oppert, means "the tower of languages." We incline to the belief that this ruin, now called the Birs-Nimrud, was the original tower, and that the temple of Bel was a later construction, belonging to the palmy times of the Chaldean monarchy. An account of it will be found in Sayce, <span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>pp. 169, 170, and in Rawlinson, <span class= "ital">Anc.

As the tribes parted, their speech would diverge, and, on the other hand, as the tongues differed, those who spoke the same or cognate dialects would draw together and draw apart from the rest. We may even suppose that, prior to the building of Babel, if any of the human family had begun to spread themselves abroad upon the surface of the globe, a slight diversity in human speech had begun to show itself; and the truthfulness of the narrative will in no wise be endangered by admitting that the Divine interposition at Babel may have consisted in quickening a natural process which had already commenced to operate; nay, we are rather warranted to conclude that the whole work of subdividing human speech was not compressed into a moment of time, but, after receiving this special impulse, was left to develop and complete itself as the nations wandered farther and ever farther from the plains of Shinar (cf. Kurtz, 'Hist. of the Old Covenant,' vol. 1. pp. 108-117 (Clark's For. Theol. Lib.), and 'Quarry on Genesis,' pp. 195-206). <p>CHALDAEAN LEGEND OF THE TOWER OF BABEL. Berosus, indeed, does not refer to it, and early writers are obliged to have recourse to somewhat doubtful authorities to confirm it. Eusebius, e.g., quotes Abydenus as saying that "not long after the Flood, the ancient race of men were so puffed up with their strength and tallness of stature that they began to despise and contemn the gods, and labored to erect that very lofty tower which is now called Babylon, intending thereby to scale the heaven& But when the building approached the sky, behold, the gods called in the aid of the winds, and by their help overturned the tower, and cast it to the ground! The name of the ruin is still called Babel, because until this time all men had used the same speech; but now there was sent upon them a confusion of many and diverse tongues" ('Praep. Ev.,' 9:14). But the diligence of the late George Smith has been rewarded by discovering the fragment of an Assyrian tablet (marked If, 3657 in British Museum) containing an account of the building of the tower, in which the gods are represented as being angry at the work and confounding the speech of the builders.
