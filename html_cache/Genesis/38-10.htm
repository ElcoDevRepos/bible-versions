In the context of <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, Onan's actions were considered wicked because he deliberately disobeyed the levirate marriage custom, which was later codified in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. This custom was designed to preserve the family line and inheritance, reflecting the importance of family and lineage in ancient Israelite society. Onan's refusal to fulfill his duty to his deceased brother by providing offspring for Tamar was seen as a direct affront to God's covenantal promises to Abraham's descendants. This act of disobedience is a reminder of the seriousness with which God views sin and the importance of obedience to His commands.<p><b>so He put Onan to death as well</b><br>The immediate divine judgment on Onan underscores the principle that God is just and will not tolerate sin. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God directly intervenes to uphold His holiness, such as the deaths of Nadab and Abihu in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a> and Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>. The phrase "as well" connects Onan's fate to that of his brother Er, who was also put to death for his wickedness, emphasizing the pattern of divine retribution for sin. This serves as a warning to the Israelites and to readers of the Bible about the consequences of disobedience and the seriousness of God's judgment. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers grace and forgiveness for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/onan.htm">Onan</a></b><br>The second son of Judah, who was instructed to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to Tamar, his deceased brother's wife, by providing offspring for his brother.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The father of Onan, a patriarch of one of the twelve tribes of Israel, who plays a significant role in the account of <a href="/bsb/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The widow of Er, Onan's brother, who was to be given offspring through Onan according to the custom of levirate marriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who judges Onan's actions as wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/levirate_marriage.htm">Levirate Marriage</a></b><br>A cultural practice in ancient Israel where a man was required to marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in his brother's name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Onan's actions were not just a personal failure but a direct disobedience to God's covenantal expectations.
