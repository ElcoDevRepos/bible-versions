This act of sharing indicates Joseph's youthful naivety and perhaps a lack of awareness of the potential impact of his words on his already strained family relationships.<p><b>but his father rebuked him</b><br>Jacob's rebuke reflects a protective and corrective response, possibly to prevent further discord among his sons. It also shows Jacob's initial skepticism or disbelief, despite his own experiences with divine dreams and visions. This rebuke may also indicate Jacob's concern for family unity and the potential for jealousy among the brothers.<p><b>and said, &#8220;What is this dream that you have had?</b><br>Jacob questions the nature and source of Joseph's dream, which suggests a level of incredulity. In the cultural context, dreams were often considered messages from God, yet Jacob's question implies doubt about the dream's divine origin or its interpretation.<p><b>Will your mother and brothers and I actually come</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial hierarchy and the cultural norms of the time, where parents and elder siblings were respected and revered. The mention of "your mother" is intriguing, as Rachel, Joseph's biological mother, had already passed away. This could refer to Leah or Bilhah, who may have taken on a maternal role, or it could be a collective reference to the family unit.<p><b>and bow down to the ground before you?&#8221;</b><br>Bowing down signifies submission and honor, which would have been culturally shocking for a father and elder brothers to do before the youngest son. This foreshadows the future events in Egypt where Joseph's family does indeed bow before him, fulfilling the dream. This act of bowing also serves as a type of Christ, where Jesus, though initially rejected, is ultimately exalted and acknowledged by all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the son of Jacob and Rachel.

(Comp. <a href="/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thy mother.</span>--Rachel was certainly dead, as Joseph had at this time eleven brethren.

The enumeration of "sun, moon, and stars," means Jacob, his wives, and his children, that is, the whole family, elders and juniors, were to make obeisance to Joseph.
