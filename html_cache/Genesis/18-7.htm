In the ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality was a crucial social duty, especially in a nomadic lifestyle. Abraham's running indicates urgency and respect for his guests, who are later revealed to be divine visitors. This act of running, unusual for a man of his age and status, underscores his commitment to serving others, a theme consistent with his character throughout Genesis.<p><b>selected a tender and choice calf</b><br>The choice of a calf signifies the importance of the guests. In ancient times, offering meat, especially from a young and tender animal, was a sign of honor and generosity. This act reflects Abraham's wealth and willingness to use his resources to honor his visitors. The selection of a calf also foreshadows sacrificial themes found throughout the Bible, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.<p><b>and gave it to a servant</b><br>Abraham's delegation of the task to a servant shows his leadership and the structured household he maintained. It also reflects the communal nature of hospitality, where the entire household participates in serving guests. This mirrors the biblical principle of serving others as a community, seen in the early church in Acts.<p><b>who hurried to prepare it</b><br>The servant's haste in preparing the meal indicates the urgency and importance of the task.
