The altar was initially built in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7-8</a>, marking a place where Abram worshiped God after receiving the promise of the land. Altars in the Old Testament were places of sacrifice and worship, symbolizing communion with God. This return signifies Abram's desire to reconnect with God and reaffirm his faith. Geographically, this site is near Bethel, a location that later becomes significant in Israel's history, notably in Jacob's vision of the ladder (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>).<p><b>And there Abram called on the name of the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates a public act of worship and prayer. "Calling on the name of the LORD" is a recurring biblical theme, signifying a personal relationship with God and reliance on His promises. It reflects a pattern of worship that began with Seth's descendants (<a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>) and continues throughout Scripture. This act of calling on God's name is a precursor to the worship practices of Israel and foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on calling upon the name of Jesus for salvation (<a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>, <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).

Verse 4 pinpoints the exact spot&#8212;&#8220;to the site where he had built the altar. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD.&#8221; The narrative invites us to watch Abram retrace his steps back to the last place he&#8217;d worshiped God before the detour to Egypt (cf. <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why Returning Matters</b><p>&#8226;&#8195;Abram&#8217;s move is not random relocation; it is deliberate repentance.

The verse invites every believer to retrace steps back to the cross, reaffirm worship, and live out the assurance that the LORD remains faithful even when we wander.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the site</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4725.htm">Strong's 4725: </a> </span><span class="str2">A standing, a spot, a condition</span><br /><br /><span class="word">where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1445;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the altar.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;miz&#183;b&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
