This reflects the Egyptian influence on Joseph's life, as he spent the majority of his years in Egypt. His age at death also connects to the patriarchal narratives, where long life is often seen as a sign of divine favor. Joseph's life, marked by faithfulness and leadership, fulfilled God's promises to the patriarchs, serving as a bridge between the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the forthcoming narrative of the Exodus.<p><b>And they embalmed his body</b><br>The embalming of Joseph's body indicates his high status in Egyptian society, as embalming was typically reserved for royalty and the elite. This process, which involved preserving the body for the afterlife, aligns with Egyptian customs and beliefs about death and the afterlife. Joseph's embalming signifies his integration into Egyptian culture while maintaining his Hebrew identity, as he requested to be eventually buried in Canaan, the land promised to his ancestors.<p><b>and placed it in a coffin in Egypt.</b><br>The placement of Joseph's body in a coffin is another indication of Egyptian influence, as coffins were commonly used in Egyptian burial practices. This act also foreshadows the future Exodus, as Joseph's remains would later be carried out of Egypt by the Israelites, fulfilling his request to be buried in the Promised Land. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His promises, as Joseph's burial in Canaan would symbolize the eventual return of the Israelites to their ancestral land. Joseph's life and death serve as a type of Christ, prefiguring Jesus' role as a savior and leader who, though integrated into the world, ultimately fulfills God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob and Rachel, Joseph is a key figure in the Book of Genesis.

The mummy-cases were generally of sycamore-wood. As it would not be possible for the Israelites, now that their great protector was no more, to go with a military escort to Hebron to bury him, Joseph orders that his embalmed body should be placed in some part of Goshen, whence it would be easy to remove it when the time of deliverance had arrived. And his wish was fulfilled; for "Moses took the bones of Joseph with him" (<a href="/exodus/13-19.htm" title="And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.">Exodus 13:19</a>), and Joshua buried them in Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had given to him (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>).<p>With the death of Joseph ends the preparation for the formation of a chosen race. Summoned from a remote city upon the Persian Gulf to Palestine, Abraham had wandered there as a stranger, and Isaac and Jacob had followed in his steps. But in Palestine the race could never have multiplied largely; for there were races already there too powerful to permit of their rapid increase. Abraham and Lot, Esau and Jacob had been compelled to separate; but now, under Joseph, they had been placed in a large, fertile, and well-nigh uninhabited region. The few who dwelt there were, as far as we can judge, of the Semitic stock, and whatever immigrants came from time to time were also of the same race, and were soon enrolled in the "<span class= "ital">taf" </span>of some noble or chief. And thus all was ready for their growth into a nation; and when we next read of them they had multiplied into a people so vast that Egypt was afraid of them.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old</span> (literally, a <span class="accented">son</span> of a <span class="accented">hundred and ten years</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the children of Israel) <span class="cmt_word">embalmed him</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 2), <span class="cmt_word">and he was put in a coffin</span> (or chest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a mummy case, which was commonly constructed of sycamore wood) <span class="cmt_word">in Egypt</span>, where he remained for a period of 360 years, until the time of the Exodus, when, according to the engagement now given, his remains were carried up to Canaan, and solemnly deposited in the sepulcher of Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/50-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1428;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">died</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
