The term "your servant" indicates a position of submission and respect, which was customary in ancient Near Eastern cultures when addressing someone of higher status. This also fulfills Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7-10</a>) where his brothers' sheaves bowed down to his sheaf, symbolizing their submission to him. The mention of their father being "well" is significant, as it reassures Joseph of Jacob's health and well-being, which is a central concern for him.<p><b>&#8220;He is still alive.&#8221;</b><br>The affirmation that Jacob is "still alive" is crucial for Joseph, who has been separated from his family for many years. This statement not only provides Joseph with personal relief but also sets the stage for the eventual reunion of the family. The survival of Jacob is significant in the broader narrative of Genesis, as it ensures the continuation of the Abrahamic covenant through his lineage. This phrase also highlights the theme of God's providence and faithfulness in preserving the patriarchs.<p><b>And they bowed down to honor him.</b><br>The act of bowing down is a physical demonstration of respect and submission, which was a common practice in ancient cultures when approaching someone of authority. This action fulfills the prophetic dreams Joseph had in his youth, where his brothers' sheaves and the celestial bodies bowed to him (<a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7-9</a>). This moment is a pivotal fulfillment of those dreams, illustrating the sovereignty of God in bringing His plans to fruition despite human actions. The brothers' bowing can also be seen as a type of Christ, where every knee will bow to Jesus (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>), symbolizing ultimate recognition and submission to divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to power.
