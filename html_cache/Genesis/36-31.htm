Edom is often associated with Mount Seir and the area south of the Dead Sea. The Edomites were a significant neighboring nation to Israel, and their history is intertwined with that of the Israelites. The kings of Edom are listed to show the established governance and political structure of Edom, which contrasts with the tribal leadership of Israel at the time. This highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Esau that he would become a nation (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>before any king reigned over the Israelites:</b><br>This phrase indicates a time before the establishment of the monarchy in Israel, which began with Saul, followed by David and Solomon. The reference to Edomite kings reigning before Israel had a king underscores the historical context of Israel's development as a nation. It also reflects the prophetic nature of Israel's future monarchy, as seen in <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>, where God promises Abraham that kings will come from him.

These men exercised full monarchial power, shaping Edom&#8217;s culture and military (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a> hints at Edom&#8217;s pride born from such stability).<p>- Their rule contrasts with Israel&#8217;s tribal period, when &#8220;everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>- God allowed Edom a settled monarchy while Israel waited, underscoring His different timing for different peoples (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Edom</b><p>- Edom, settled by Esau&#8217;s descendants (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>), lay south-east of the Promised Land.<p>- The geography matters: Edom controlled key trade routes, so its kings wielded economic influence long before Israel&#8217;s united kingdom (see <a href="/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a> for later conflicts on that same terrain).<p>- Though related to Israel through Isaac, Edom often opposed Israel (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>), making the early rise of Edomite kings a future test for Jacob&#8217;s line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before any king reigned</b><p>- The Holy Spirit highlights chronology: Edom had monarchs centuries prior to Saul&#8217;s coronation (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>).<p>- This timing underscores Israel&#8217;s unique theocracy&#8212;instead of a human king, they lived under direct divine rule during the Judges (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>).<p>- The verse silently warns that having a king early is not automatically a blessing; Edom&#8217;s later downfall (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>) proves that security rests on obedience to God, not on governmental structure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>over the Israelites</b><p>- Israel eventually clamored, &#8220;Appoint a king to judge us like all the other nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), but until then the LORD Himself was their King (<a href="/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>).<p>- The contrast teaches contentment with God&#8217;s timing; when Israel forced the issue, Saul&#8217;s troubled reign revealed the cost (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p>- By noting that Edom had kings first, Genesis anticipates Israel&#8217;s temptation to envy worldly systems (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> already prepared guidelines for the future monarch).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a> records that Edom enjoyed an organized monarchy long before Israel ever crowned a king. The verse showcases God&#8217;s precise historical oversight, highlights Edom&#8217;s early political strength, and contrasts that with Israel&#8217;s season of divine kingship. It quietly reminds readers that every nation moves on God&#8217;s timetable, and true security comes not from early institutions but from humble submission to the LORD who rules over all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">The kings.</span>--In the triumphal song of Moses on the Red Sea we still read of "dukes of Edom" (<a href="/exodus/15-15.htm" title="Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold on them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.">Exodus 15:15</a>; but when Israel had reached the borders of their land, we find that Edom had then a king (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm" title="And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:">Numbers 20:14</a>). But in the list given here, no king succeeds his father, and probably these were petty monarchs, who sprang up in various parts of the country during a long period of civil war, in which the Horites were finally as completely conquered as were the Canaanites in Palestine under the heavy hands of Saul and Solomon. In the time of the dukes, there were also Horite dukes of the race of Seir, ruling districts mixed up apparently with those governed by the descendants of Esau. But all these now disappear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these</span> (which follow) <span class="cmt_word">are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any</span> (literally, <span class="accented">before the reigning</span> of a) <span class="cmt_word">king over</span> (or, to) <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel</span>. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The reference to Israelitish kings in this place has been explained as an evidence of post-Mosaic authorship (Le Clerc, Bleek, Ewald, Bohlen, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), or at least as a later interpolation from <a href="/1_chronicles/1-43.htm">1 Chronicles 1:43</a> (Kennicott, A.
