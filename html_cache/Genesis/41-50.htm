Joseph, having interpreted Pharaoh's dreams, predicted seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-30</a>). The timing of the birth of Joseph's sons during the years of plenty highlights God's provision and blessing in Joseph's life before the impending hardship. This period of abundance can be seen as a time of preparation, reflecting the biblical principle of stewardship and foresight (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>).<p><b>two sons were born to Joseph</b><br>The birth of Joseph's sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, is significant in the broader narrative of Israel's history. These sons would later become the heads of two of the tribes of Israel, with Ephraim often representing the northern kingdom (<a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). The fact that Joseph had two sons during this time of prosperity underscores the theme of fruitfulness and divine blessing, reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham about his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p><b>by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On</b><br>Asenath's identity provides insight into the cultural and religious milieu of Egypt. On, also known as Heliopolis, was a major center of worship for the sun god Ra. Potiphera, as a priest of On, held a significant religious position, indicating Joseph's integration into Egyptian society. This marriage alliance reflects Joseph's elevated status in Egypt and God's sovereignty in using even foreign elements to fulfill His purposes. The union of Joseph and Asenath can be seen as a type of Christ's relationship with the Church, where Christ, though divine, is united with humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who rose to power in Egypt, second only to Pharaoh.

God foretold seven plentiful years followed by seven of famine (<a href="/genesis/41-29.htm">Genesis 41:29-31</a>). Joseph&#8217;s sons were conceived during abundance, underscoring God&#8217;s provision ahead of need (cf. <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-8.htm">Matthew 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights divine foresight. Long before the crisis struck (<a href="/genesis/41-53.htm">Genesis 41:53-54</a>), the Lord was already preparing blessings that would sustain Joseph&#8217;s family line.<p>&#8226; It also marks a hinge in Joseph&#8217;s life&#8212;he is no longer merely the favored son or forgotten prisoner but a statesman whose personal joys occur in the calm before national distress (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46-49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two sons were born to Joseph</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;two sons were born to Joseph&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Double blessing: In a land that once symbolized Joseph&#8217;s slavery, God grants him not one but two children (<a href="/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51-52</a>). Compare with <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12-13</a> for the theme of restored fortunes multiplied.<p>&#8226; Covenant continuity: Though in Egypt, Joseph remains heir to the promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11-12</a>). His sons will later be adopted by Jacob as full tribal heirs (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5-6</a>), cementing their place within Israel.<p>&#8226; Practical provision: The birth of Ephraim (&#8220;fruitful&#8221;) and Manasseh (&#8220;causing to forget&#8221;) foreshadows the spiritual and emotional healing God brings through family (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Asenath daughter of Potiphera</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;by Asenath daughter of Potiphera&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over unlikely unions. Joseph marries an Egyptian of priestly lineage (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>). Similar to Rahab and Ruth later joining Israel (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-17</a>), Asenath&#8217;s inclusion anticipates Gentile participation in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Cultural contrast. While Joseph remains faithful to the God of his fathers, Asenath&#8217;s background emphasizes the power of the true God to transcend cultural and religious barriers (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Redemption of circumstances: Joseph&#8217;s earlier encounter with Potiphar&#8217;s household (<a href="/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1-20</a>) ended in false accusation; now a new household connection becomes a channel of blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>priest of On</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;priest of On.&#8221;<p>&#8226; On (Heliopolis) was a center of sun-god worship. By marrying into this family, Joseph visibly stands as a witness to the Most High in the heart of Egyptian religion (<a href="/psalms/105-21.htm">Psalm 105:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Political alliance: Pharaoh&#8217;s arrangement (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>) secures Joseph&#8217;s standing, enabling him to implement the grain program that will save many lives (<a href="/genesis/41-55.htm">Genesis 41:55-57</a>; 50:20).<p>&#8226; Spiritual contrast: While On revered Ra, Joseph&#8217;s life testifies that only the God of Abraham reveals the future and controls harvest and famine (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-20.htm">Daniel 2:20-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50</a> shows God working ahead of calamity, granting Joseph two sons during years of plenty through a wife from Egypt&#8217;s priestly class. The verse underscores divine timing, the multiplication of covenant blessings, and the Lord&#8217;s ability to weave His purposes through unlikely relationships and settings. Long before scarcity strikes, God&#8217;s faithfulness is already providing legacy, comfort, and testimony to His supremacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50, 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And unto Joseph wore born two sons before the years of famine came,</span> (literally, <span class="accented">before the coming of the gears of famine</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph called, the name of the firstborn Manasseh</span> ("Forgetting," from <span class="accented">nashah</span>, to forget): <span class="cmt_word">For God</span> (Elohim;
