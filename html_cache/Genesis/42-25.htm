This act of provision is significant, as it fulfills the dreams he had as a young man (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his. The grain symbolizes sustenance and survival during the famine, highlighting Joseph's role as a savior figure. This prefigures Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>to return each man&#8217;s silver to his sack</b><br>Joseph's decision to return the silver is a test of his brothers' integrity and a demonstration of grace. The silver, a common medium of exchange in ancient times, represents the cost of the grain. By returning it, Joseph challenges his brothers to confront their past actions and their honesty. This act foreshadows the concept of unmerited favor, akin to the grace offered through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>and to give them provisions for their journey</b><br>Joseph ensures his brothers have enough supplies for their return trip, showing his concern for their well-being. This provision reflects the biblical theme of God's care and provision for His people during their journeys, reminiscent of God's provision for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It underscores the importance of hospitality and care for others, a recurring biblical principle.<p><b>This order was carried out</b><br>The obedience of Joseph's servants in executing his orders reflects the authority he holds in Egypt. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of Joseph's intentions, which align with God's overarching plan for the preservation of Jacob's family. This obedience can be seen as a parallel to the fulfillment of God's promises throughout scripture, emphasizing the reliability and faithfulness of God's word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
