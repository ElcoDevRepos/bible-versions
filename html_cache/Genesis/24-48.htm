Bowing down is a physical act of reverence and submission, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Worshiping the LORD signifies acknowledging God's sovereignty and providence. This act of worship is a model of faithfulness and obedience, reflecting the servant's recognition of God's hand in guiding his journey. It echoes the biblical theme of worship as a response to God's faithfulness, seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a> when Moses bows in worship.<p><b>and I blessed the LORD,</b><br>Blessing the LORD involves praising and thanking God for His goodness and guidance. This reflects a heart of gratitude and acknowledges God's active role in the events of life. The act of blessing God is seen in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1-2</a>, where David calls on his soul to bless the LORD for His benefits. It underscores the importance of recognizing God's blessings and expressing gratitude.<p><b>the God of my master Abraham,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Abraham. It highlights the servant's understanding of God's promises to Abraham, which include making him a great nation and blessing all families of the earth through him (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The servant's reference to God as the God of Abraham underscores the continuity of God's faithfulness across generations. It also points to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenantal faithfulness, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>who led me on the right road</b><br>The servant acknowledges God's guidance in his journey, which is a testament to divine providence. The "right road" signifies not only the physical path but also the correct course of action in fulfilling his mission. This reflects the biblical theme of God directing the paths of those who seek Him, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. It also illustrates the concept of God's guidance in the lives of believers, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>to take the granddaughter of my master&#8217;s brother for his son.</b><br>This phrase refers to Rebekah, the granddaughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother. The familial connection is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern customs, where marriages within the extended family were common to preserve family lineage and property. This arrangement aligns with God's covenant promises to Abraham, ensuring that Isaac's wife comes from his own kin. The successful completion of this task is seen as a fulfillment of God's promise and guidance, further illustrating God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite nation, who sent his servant to find a wife for his son Isaac.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Likely Eliezer of Damascus, Abraham's trusted servant, tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The granddaughter of Abraham's brother Nahor, chosen to be Isaac's wife.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahor.htm">Nahor</a></b><br>Abraham's brother, whose family the servant visits to find a wife for Isaac.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/haran.htm">Haran</a></b><br>The place where Nahor's family lived, and where the servant traveled to find Rebekah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_service.htm">Faithful Service</a></b><br>The servant's dedication to his master's mission exemplifies faithful service.

This repetition shows a lifestyle pattern: whenever God moves, genuine worship follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and worshiped the LORD;</b><p>&#8226; Worship is more than posture; it is adoration flowing from gratitude.<p>&#8226; Like Moses and Israel who &#8220;bowed down and worshiped&#8221; when God promised deliverance (<a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>), the servant celebrates the LORD&#8217;s covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; He does not take credit for clever planning; he ascribes every success to the LORD, echoing <a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham,</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Blessed&#8221; here means speaking well of God&#8212;publicly declaring His goodness (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the LORD as &#8220;the God of my master Abraham,&#8221; the servant ties this moment to the broader covenant promise (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s praise also reinforces his role as steward; all he does is on behalf of Abraham, just as believers today serve on behalf of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who led me on the right road</b><p>&#8226; Guidance is attributed solely to the LORD. <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a> echoes the same confidence: &#8220;He will make your paths straight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The &#8220;right road&#8221; was not just a geographical route but the providential path that fulfilled God&#8217;s plan for Isaac&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the servant had prayed specifically for direction (<a href="/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12&#8211;14</a>); God&#8217;s answer now fuels his thanksgiving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to take the granddaughter of my master&#8217;s brother for his son.</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights God&#8217;s precision: Rebekah meets both familial and spiritual qualifications, preserving the covenant line without compromise (<a href="/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s mission aligns with Abraham&#8217;s insistence that Isaac not marry a Canaanite (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s orchestration here anticipates later moments when He chooses specific people for His redemptive purposes, such as Ruth for Boaz (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every clause of <a href="/genesis/24-48.htm">Genesis 24:48</a> showcases a progression: humble posture, heartfelt worship, vocal blessing, confident recognition of divine guidance, and joyful acknowledgment of God&#8217;s exact fulfillment of covenant promises. The servant models how believers respond when God unmistakably directs: bow, worship, bless, testify, and rest in the assurance that the Lord&#8217;s guidance is always the right road.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/24-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I bowed down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eq&#183;q&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
