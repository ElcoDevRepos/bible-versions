In the context of Genesis, God often speaks directly to convey His will, as seen in the creation narrative and His interactions with the patriarchs. This divine speech sets the stage for a significant shift in human history.<p><b>My Spirit will not contend with man forever</b><br>The term "Spirit" here refers to God's life-giving presence and influence. The word "contend" suggests a struggle or striving, indicating that God has been patient with humanity's increasing wickedness. This echoes the theme of divine patience and eventual judgment found throughout Scripture, such as in the days of Noah and later in the prophetic warnings to Israel.<p><b>for he is mortal</b><br>This phrase highlights the frailty and finite nature of human beings. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of the Fall, where mortality was introduced as a result of sin. The acknowledgment of human mortality underscores the need for divine intervention and redemption, pointing forward to the hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ.<p><b>his days shall be 120 years</b><br>This can be interpreted as a limitation on human lifespan or as a countdown to the impending judgment of the Flood. The number 120 may symbolize a period of grace before the Flood, during which Noah preached righteousness. This period reflects God's mercy, giving humanity time to repent. The reduction in lifespan also contrasts with the earlier long lifespans recorded in Genesis, marking a shift in human history post-Flood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal nature and His authority over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man (Humanity)</a></b><br>Refers to the human race, which had become increasingly corrupt and sinful during this period.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>Represents God's presence and life-giving power, which was striving with humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/1/120_years.htm">120 Years</a></b><br>A period of grace given by God before the impending judgment of the flood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_mercy.htm">God's Patience and Mercy</a></b><br>God&#8217;s declaration of 120 years before the flood demonstrates His patience and desire for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_mortality_and_sinfulness.htm">Human Mortality and Sinfulness</a></b><br>The verse highlights human mortality and the consequences of sin, reminding us of our need for God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit's striving with humanity indicates God's active involvement in guiding and convicting us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_grace.htm">Divine Judgment and Grace</a></b><br>While God&#8217;s judgment is certain, His grace provides an opportunity for repentance and transformation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternity_in_mind.htm">Living with Eternity in Mind</a></b><br>Understanding our mortality should lead us to live purposefully, seeking to align our lives with God&#8217;s will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_6_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 6:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/God_s_patience_is_not_endless.htm">What does "My Spirit will not contend with man forever" imply about God's patience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_6_3_Judgment_mercy_link.htm">How does Genesis 6:3 relate to God's judgment and mercy throughout Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_the_120-year_warning_now.htm">In what ways can we apply the 120-year warning to our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_6_3_Live_righteously_for_God.htm">How does Genesis 6:3 emphasize the importance of living righteously in God's eyes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Genesis_6_3_on_humanity.htm">What lessons about human nature and divine limits can be drawn from Genesis 6:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Genesis_6_3_phrase.htm">What does "My Spirit will not contend with man forever" mean in Genesis 6:3?

The verse blends warning and grace: warning that divine patience has limits, and grace in granting time to repent before judgment falls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And the Lord said.</span>--As the Sethites are now the fallen race, it is their covenant Jehovah who determines to reduce the extreme duration of human life to that which, under the most favourable sanitary influences, might still be its normal length.<p><span class= "bld">My spirit shall not always strive with man.</span>--The meaning of this much-contested clause is really settled by the main purpose and context of the verse, which is the Divine determination to shorten human life. Whether, then, God's spirit be the animating breath spoken of in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-22.htm" title="All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.">Genesis 7:22</a>, whereby human life is sustained, or the spiritual part of man, his conscience and moral sense--God's best gift to him--in opposition to his flesh, the struggle henceforward is not to be indefinitely prolonged. In the first case, the struggle spoken of is that between the elements of life and death in the body; in the second, it refers to the moral probation to which man is subject. The versions generally take the former meaning, and translate "shall not dwell," or "abide "; but there is much in favour of the rendering "shall strive," though the verb more exactly means <span class= "ital">to rule, preside over, sit as judge. </span>Literally, then, it signifies that the Divine gift of life shall not rule in man "for ever;" that is, for a period so protracted as was antediluvian life. (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">With man.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">with the adam: </span>spoken with especial reference to the Sethites.<p><span class= "bld">For that he also is flesh.</span>--So all the versions; but many commentators, to avoid an Aramaism which does not occur again till the later Psalms, translate, "in their erring he is (= they are) flesh." But no reason for shortening human life can be found in this commonplace assertion; and if Abraham brought these records with him from Ur, we have an explanation of the acknowledged fact that Aramaisms do occur in the earlier portions of the Bible. Man, then, is "also" flesh, that is, his body is of the same nature as those of the animals, and in spite of his noble gifts and precedence, he must submit to a life of the same moderate duration as that allotted them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> - Jehovah; not because due to the Jehovist (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso), but because the sin above specified was a direct violation of the footing of grace on which the Sethites stood - <span class="cmt_word">said</span>, - to himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> purposed, - <span class="cmt_word">My spirit</span> - neither "ira, seu rigida Dei justitia" (Venema), nor "the Divine spirit of life bestowed upon man, the principle of physical and ethical, natural and spiritual life" (Keil); but the Holy Ghost, the Ruach Elohim of <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> - <span class="cmt_word">shall not always strive</span>. <span class="accented">London</span>: <span class="accented">-</span> <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Shall not dwell (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">non permanebit</span>; Syriac, Onkelos). <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Shall not be humbled, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by dwelling in men (Gesenius, Tuch). <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> More probably, shall not rule (De Wette, Delitzsch, Kalisch, Furst), or shall not judge (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), as the consequence of ruling (Symmachus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil), or shall not contend in judgment (<span class="accented">arguere, reprehendere</span>; cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strive with a man by moral force (Calvin, Michaelis, Dathe, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Bush). <span class="cmt_word">With man, for that he also</span> <span class="accented">- beshaggam</span>.

Tuch, Colenso, and others, supposing this to have been said by God in Noah's 500th year, find a respite only of 100 years, instead of 120; but the historian does not assert that it was then God either formed or announced this determination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
