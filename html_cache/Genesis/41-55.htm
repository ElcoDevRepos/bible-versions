The famine's extremity underscores the fulfillment of Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-32</a>), demonstrating God's sovereignty and the reliability of divine revelation. The famine's impact on "all the land" emphasizes its severity and sets the stage for Joseph's rise to power, as he had been divinely prepared to manage this crisis.<p><b>and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food</b><br>In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh was considered a god-king, responsible for the welfare of his people. The people's cry to Pharaoh reflects their desperation and reliance on his divine authority to provide sustenance. This situation mirrors the Israelites' later cries to God during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>), highlighting a recurring biblical theme of dependence on divine provision during times of need.<p><b>he told all the Egyptians, &#8220;Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's directive to the Egyptians to seek Joseph's guidance signifies Joseph's elevated status and trustworthiness. Joseph, a type of Christ, serves as a mediator and savior figure, prefiguring Jesus' role as the ultimate provider and sustainer (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). This command also illustrates the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams of leadership (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) and foreshadows the coming of a greater deliverer who would provide spiritual sustenance to all who seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to prominence in Egypt by interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, and was appointed as the second-in-command to manage the impending famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who recognized Joseph's God-given wisdom and appointed him to oversee the land's resources during the famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land experiencing a severe famine, leading its people to seek sustenance and guidance from their leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A widespread scarcity of food that affected Egypt and surrounding regions, fulfilling the prophecy revealed through Pharaoh's dreams.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt who were directed by Pharaoh to seek Joseph's guidance during the famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>Joseph's journey from slavery to leadership demonstrates God's control and purpose in our lives, even through difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_obedience.htm">Wisdom and Obedience</a></b><br>Pharaoh's command to the Egyptians to follow Joseph's instructions highlights the importance of seeking and obeying godly wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provision_in_times_of_need.htm">Provision in Times of Need</a></b><br>Just as God provided for Egypt through Joseph, He provides for us in our times of need, often through unexpected means.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Joseph's role in managing the famine teaches us about the responsibility that comes with leadership and the importance of using our gifts for the benefit of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>Joseph's faithfulness in prison and in Potiphar's house prepared him for greater responsibilities, reminding us to be faithful in all circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_41_55_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 41:55?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_41_55_God_s_provision_in_famine.htm">How does Genesis 41:55 demonstrate God's provision during times of famine?

Like the later famine in <a href="/acts/7-11.htm">Acts 7:11</a>, this scarcity presses people to recognize their dependence on a higher authority&#8212;and, ultimately, on God Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food</b><p>Egypt&#8217;s citizens naturally turn to their king, the one who seemed to hold the power of life and death. Similar scenes repeat throughout Scripture: Israelites cry out under oppression (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>), and even under their own chosen monarchy they will &#8220;cry out&#8221; for relief (<a href="/1_samuel/8-18.htm">1 Samuel 8:18</a>). Famine strips away self-reliance; the people&#8217;s plea underscores that human leadership is limited without God&#8217;s foresight and provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he told all the Egyptians</b><p>Pharaoh does not keep Joseph&#8217;s plan private or reserved for elites. Earlier he had declared, &#8220;Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>). Now he backs those words with action, publicly directing every Egyptian to the man God has raised up. Pharaoh&#8217;s instruction is more than political; it is a tacit acknowledgment that divine wisdom has been entrusted to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go to Joseph</b><p>In one concise command Pharaoh redirects trust toward Joseph, whom God has placed second only to the throne (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-44</a>). The phrase recalls later gospel echoes: Mary tells the servants at Cana, &#8220;Do whatever He tells you&#8221; concerning Jesus (<a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a>). Joseph becomes a mediator of life-saving provision, foreshadowing the greater Mediator who will feed multitudes both physically and spiritually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and do whatever he tells you</b><p>Total obedience is required for survival. Joseph alone possesses the stores of grain and the strategy for distribution. Earlier, Pharaoh had said, &#8220;Whatever he says to you, you shall do&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>, NKJ). The same all-embracing obedience is urged by the Father regarding His Son: &#8220;Listen to Him!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>). In both cases, blessing flows to those who submit fully to God&#8217;s chosen servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-55.htm">Genesis 41:55</a> records more than a government directive; it reveals God&#8217;s sovereign care in crisis. The famine exposes need, the people&#8217;s cry highlights human inadequacy, Pharaoh&#8217;s order points to God-given wisdom, and Joseph&#8217;s authority prefigures Christ&#8217;s role as the only source of life. The verse calls readers today to recognize God&#8217;s providence, heed His appointed Savior, and trust that wholehearted obedience leads to preservation and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all the land of Egypt was famished</span> (literally, and), <span class="cmt_word">the people cried to Pharaoh for bread</span>: - cf. the famine in Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/6-26.htm">2 Kings 6:26</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph;
