The reference to "men" indicates the collective behavior of the city's population, emphasizing the widespread nature of their wickedness.<p><b>were wicked</b><br>The term "wicked" in this context refers to moral corruption and evil behavior. In the biblical narrative, wickedness is often associated with actions that are contrary to God's laws and character. The wickedness of Sodom is later exemplified in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the men of the city attempt to commit grievous acts against Lot's visitors. This wickedness is not just individual but systemic, affecting the entire community.<p><b>sinning greatly</b><br>The phrase "sinning greatly" underscores the severity and extent of the sin in Sodom. It implies habitual and egregious sin, not just isolated incidents. This great sinning is a direct affront to God's holiness and justice. The New Testament references Sodom's sin as a warning (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6-8</a>, <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>), illustrating the consequences of living in persistent rebellion against God.<p><b>against the LORD</b><br>The phrase "against the LORD" indicates that the sin of Sodom was not just a social or moral failing but a direct offense against God Himself. This highlights the theological dimension of sin, where actions are ultimately evaluated in relation to God's standards. The LORD, being the covenant name of God, emphasizes His personal relationship with humanity and His righteous judgment. The destruction of Sodom serves as a divine response to their sin, illustrating God's justice and the seriousness of sinning against Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom.htm">Sodom</a></b><br>An ancient city located in the region of the Jordan Valley, known for its extreme wickedness and eventual destruction by God due to its inhabitants' sinful behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_sodom.htm">Men of Sodom</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Sodom, characterized by their wickedness and sinful actions, which were offensive to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate judge of human actions and the one against whom the men of Sodom sinned.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>The wickedness of Sodom serves as a stark reminder of the nature of sin and its consequences.
