Canaan, a region known for its diverse geography and strategic location, was central to God's plan for Israel. This area, later known as the Promised Land, is rich in biblical history and prophecy. Abram's presence here foreshadows the eventual establishment of Israel. Canaan was inhabited by various tribes, and Abram's faith in God's promise is evident as he dwells among them, trusting in God's protection and provision.<p><b>but Lot settled in the cities of the plain</b><br>Lot's decision to settle in the cities of the plain, specifically the Jordan Valley, reflects a choice based on immediate prosperity rather than spiritual discernment. The plain was fertile and well-watered, reminiscent of the Garden of the LORD (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), making it an attractive option for Lot's livestock. However, this choice also places Lot in proximity to morally corrupt societies, highlighting a contrast between Abram's faith-driven decisions and Lot's material-driven choices. This decision sets the stage for future events involving Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>and pitched his tent toward Sodom</b><br>Lot's action of pitching his tent toward Sodom indicates a gradual movement towards a city known for its wickedness (<a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>). Sodom, along with Gomorrah, becomes synonymous with sin and divine judgment. This phrase suggests Lot's increasing association with Sodom, foreshadowing his eventual residence there and the ensuing consequences. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromising with sin. The New Testament references Sodom as a symbol of moral decay and divine retribution (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>), reinforcing the gravity of Lot's choice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of a great nation.

Abram therefore abides where God sent him, showing faith like <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8&#8211;9</a> commends&#8212;dwelling in tents, yet confident the promise is real.<p>&#8226; The choice reflects obedience over convenience. While the famine earlier pushed Abram to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>), he now remains where the Lord directed him, trusting God to provide (compare <a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Living &#8220;in&#8221; Canaan yet still as a pilgrim underscores that God&#8217;s people can be physically present in the world without adopting its values (<a href="/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By staying, Abram keeps himself close to the altars he built (<a href="/genesis/13-4.htm">Genesis 13:4, 18</a>), sustaining worship and communion with God&#8212;priority number one for a covenant bearer (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Lot settled in the cities of the plain</b><p>&#8220;but Lot settled in the cities of the plain&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a>b).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;plain&#8221; or Jordan Valley appeared &#8220;like the garden of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), so Lot chooses by sight, not by promise&#8212;a contrast to Abram&#8217;s faith walk (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Lot opts for city life, valuing prosperity and convenience over spiritual safety. Jesus later warns, &#8220;What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;cities&#8221; hints at fragmentation; unlike Abram&#8217;s unified household under God, Lot immerses himself in a network of urban centers that will soon face judgment (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Though righteous in himself (<a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7&#8211;8</a>), Lot exposes his family to moral compromise, foreshadowing the losses he will suffer. Wise believers count the cost of where they plant their lives (<a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pitched his tent toward Sodom</b><p>&#8220;and pitched his tent toward Sodom&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a>c).<p>&#8226; Direction matters. Pointing the tent flap toward Sodom positions Lot to absorb its culture day by day&#8212;an early step on a slippery slope (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 13 immediately reminds readers, &#8220;Now the men of Sodom were wicked, exceedingly sinful against the LORD.&#8221; Choosing proximity to known sin dulls discernment (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Lot&#8217;s gradual drift: first looking (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), then living near (13:12), later sitting &#8220;in the gate of Sodom&#8221; as an official (<a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>). Temptation often enters by incremental compromise (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Sodom epitomizes moral rebellion; Jude 7 records it as a perpetual warning. Pitching one&#8217;s life in that direction invites both influence and eventual judgment (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abram and Lot stand side by side, yet their choices diverge: Abram remains in Canaan, trusting God&#8217;s promise; Lot gravitates to the fertile cities, tent opening toward corruption. <a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a> quietly teaches that where we live, what we value, and which direction we face determine spiritual outcomes.

While, then, Abram continued to lead a hardy life as a stranger upon the bracing hills, Lot sighed for the less self-denying habits of the city; and probably, when he had descended into the Ghor, the enervating climate, which so developed the sensual vices of the people as to make them "sinners before Jehovah" (see on <a href="/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a>), disposed Lot also to quit his tent, and yield himself to a luxurious and easy manner of living.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan</span>.
