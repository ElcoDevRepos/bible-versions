The mention of "one night" indicates a particular moment of divine intervention, as dreams in the Bible often serve as a means for God to communicate His will or reveal future events. This aligns with the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty over time and events.<p><b>both the chief baker and I</b><br>The speaker here is the chief cupbearer, recounting his experience to Pharaoh. The chief baker and the chief cupbearer were high-ranking officials in Pharaoh's court, responsible for the safety and quality of Pharaoh's food and drink. Their imprisonment suggests a serious breach of trust or suspicion of wrongdoing. This context highlights the precarious nature of serving in royal courts, where positions of power could quickly turn into positions of vulnerability.<p><b>had dreams</b><br>Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered significant, believed to be messages from the divine. In the biblical narrative, dreams frequently serve as a medium for God&#8217;s revelation, as seen with figures like Jacob and Daniel. The fact that both men had dreams on the same night suggests a coordinated divine message, emphasizing the importance of the events that follow.<p><b>and each dream had its own meaning</b><br>This indicates that the dreams were not random or meaningless but had specific interpretations. In the biblical context, this underscores the belief that God communicates purposefully and with clarity. Joseph&#8217;s ability to interpret these dreams later in the chapter demonstrates his God-given wisdom and foreshadows his rise to power. This also prefigures the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate revealer of God&#8217;s will and truth, as seen in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers and ended up in Egypt.

Likewise, Joseph later points out that Pharaoh&#8217;s two dreams confirm &#8220;the matter is determined by God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The cupbearer&#8217;s inclusion of himself shows honest testimony&#8212;he was a first-hand witness to God&#8217;s work in prison, just as he will be an instrument of Joseph&#8217;s release.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had dreams</b><p>In Scripture dreams are a legitimate channel for God&#8217;s voice.<p>&#8226; Earlier, Joseph himself received destiny-shaping dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God warned Abimelech in a dream (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) and reassured Jacob on his departure to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Joel foretold and Peter affirmed that &#8220;your old men will dream dreams&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>).<p>For these officials, the dreams were not random images but instruments of divine disclosure, waiting for interpretation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and each dream had its own meaning</b><p>The cupbearer notes individual specificity&#8212;one dream led to restoration, the other to judgment (<a href="/genesis/41-13.htm">Genesis 41:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s messages are never vague; each carries a distinct purpose (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25</a>&#8212;Joseph explains Pharaoh&#8217;s dreams; <a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14-16</a> speaks of God &#8220;sealing their instruction&#8221; through dreams).<p>&#8226; The uniqueness of each dream also highlights the need for Spirit-given interpretation. Human conjecture failed Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians (<a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>), but God granted Joseph clarity (<a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse teaches that divine revelation is both personal and precise, calling for humble hearing and obedient response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11</a> captures a pivotal recollection: in a single night God spoke separately yet simultaneously to two high officials, proving His sovereignty over timing, persons, and messages. The specificity of each dream prepared the way for Joseph&#8217;s God-given interpretation, the cupbearer&#8217;s restored memory, and ultimately Joseph&#8217;s elevation to save many lives. The verse reminds believers that the Lord still speaks with purpose, and every revelation He grants carries a distinct, trustworthy meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/41-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">night</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;lay&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3915.htm">Strong's 3915: </a> </span><span class="str2">A twist, night, adversity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">both [the chief baker]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had dreams,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(wan&#183;na&#183;&#7717;al&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common plural &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2492.htm">Strong's 2492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind firmly, to be, plump, to dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dream</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2472.htm">Strong's 2472: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had its own meaning.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;p&#772;i&#7791;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6623.htm">Strong's 6623: </a> </span><span class="str2">Interpretation</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/41-11.htm">OT Law: Genesis 41:11 We dreamed a dream in one night (Gen.
