His anger would have been a serious matter, reflecting the absolute authority he wielded. In the ancient Near East, kings often had the power of life and death over their subjects. The term "officers" indicates these men held significant positions within Pharaoh's court, responsible for critical duties. This context highlights the gravity of their offense, whatever it may have been, and sets the stage for the unfolding events in Joseph's life.<p><b>the chief cupbearer</b><br>The chief cupbearer was a high-ranking official responsible for serving wine to Pharaoh. This role was not merely about serving drinks; it involved significant trust, as the cupbearer had to ensure the safety of the king's drink, protecting him from poisoning. This position often allowed the cupbearer to become a close confidant of the king, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>, where Nehemiah serves as cupbearer to the Persian king. The cupbearer's fall from grace would have been a notable event in the royal court.<p><b>and the chief baker</b><br>The chief baker was another important official, responsible for preparing the king's food. Like the cupbearer, the baker's role required trustworthiness, as he was responsible for the safety and quality of the food served to Pharaoh. The mention of both the cupbearer and the baker suggests a possible conspiracy or serious breach of trust, as both positions were crucial to the king's daily life. This incident foreshadows the dreams they will have, which Joseph will interpret, leading to his rise in Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, considered a god by his people, who held absolute power over the land and its inhabitants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_cupbearer.htm">Chief Cupbearer</a></b><br>An important official in Pharaoh's court responsible for serving wine and ensuring it was not poisoned.
