The term "account" or "generations" (Hebrew: toledot) is a structural marker in Genesis, indicating a new section. Jacob, also known as Israel, is a patriarch whose life and family are central to the unfolding story of God's covenant with Abraham's descendants. This account sets the stage for the events leading to the Israelites' eventual move to Egypt.<p><b>When Joseph was seventeen years old,</b><br>Joseph's age is significant as it marks him as a young man on the cusp of adulthood. At seventeen, he is old enough to work with his brothers but still young enough to be under his father's authority. His youth and favored status by Jacob contribute to the tension with his brothers. Joseph's age also foreshadows his future growth and maturity through trials and leadership in Egypt.<p><b>he was tending the flock with his brothers,</b><br>Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including among the patriarchs. This task required skill and responsibility, indicating Joseph's involvement in family duties. The mention of Joseph working alongside his brothers highlights the familial relationships and sets the stage for the ensuing conflict. Shepherding also serves as a metaphor for leadership and care, themes that recur in Joseph's life.<p><b>the sons of his father&#8217;s wives Bilhah and Zilpah,</b><br>Bilhah and Zilpah were maidservants given to Jacob by his wives Rachel and Leah, respectively, and became secondary wives. Their sons, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, were considered full members of Jacob's family but may have had a lower status compared to Leah and Rachel's sons. This detail underscores the complex family dynamics and rivalries, as Joseph, the son of Rachel, Jacob's favored wife, is set apart from these brothers.<p><b>and he brought their father a bad report about them.</b><br>Joseph's action of bringing a negative report to Jacob suggests a role of oversight or accountability, possibly indicating his favored position. This act likely exacerbated the animosity between him and his brothers, as it could be seen as tattling or seeking favor with their father. The "bad report" foreshadows the brothers' later betrayal and Joseph's journey from favored son to slave, and eventually to a position of power in Egypt. This narrative also prefigures Christ, who, like Joseph, was rejected by His own but ultimately became a savior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the father of Joseph and his brothers.

(See Note on <a href="/genesis/28-10.htm" title="And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.">Genesis 28:10</a>.) This <span class= "ital">Toldoth, </span>therefore, extends to the end of Genesis, and is the history of the removal, through Joseph's instrumentality, of the family of Jacob from Canaan into Egypt, as a step preparatory to its growth into a nation.<p><span class= "bld">Joseph being seventeen years old.</span>--He was born about seven years before Jacob left Haran, and as the journey home probably occupied two full years, he would have dwelt in Isaac's neighbourhood for seven or eight years. Isaac's life, as we have seen, was prolonged for about twelve years after the sale of Joseph by his brethren.<p><span class= "bld">And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">And he was lad with the sons of Bilhah, </span>&c. The probable meaning of this is, that as the youngest son it was his duty to wait upon his brothers, just as David had to look after the sheep, while his brothers went to the festival; and was also sent to the camp to attend to them (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm" title="And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here.">1Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-17.htm" title="And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;">1Samuel 17:17-18</a>). The sons of Jacob were dispersed in detachments over the large extent of country occupied by Jacob's cattle, and Joseph probably after his mother's death, when he was about nine years' old, would be brought up in the tent of Bilhah, his mother's handmaid. He would naturally, therefore, go with her sons, with whom were also the sons of the other handmaid. They do not seem to have taken any special part in Joseph's sale. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the generations of Jacob</span>.

Pererius, following the Vulgate, connects the clause with what precedes; Calvin, Dathius, Lange, Murphy, Kalisch, and others conjoin it with the words that follow; the LXX., Willet, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Ainsworth, Bush, etc. regard it as a parenthetical statement - <span class="cmt_word">with</span> - not in the capacity of a servant (Vatablus) or of a ward (Kalisch), but of a companion - <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives.</span> With these rather than the sons of Leah, as being less supercilious and haughty than the children of the first wife (Lawson), or as being less opposed to him than they (Lange), or more probably as being nearer to his own age than they (Keil), or perhaps as having been brought more into contact with the handmaids' children, and in particular with those of Bilhah, Rachel's maid, who may have been to him as a mother after Rachel's death (Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph brought unto his</span> (rather, their) <span class="cmt_word">father their evil report</span>.
