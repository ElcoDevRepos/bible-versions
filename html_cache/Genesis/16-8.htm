This highlights her social status and the power dynamics at play. In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants or slaves were often considered property, and their lives were heavily influenced by their masters. Hagar's Egyptian origin (<a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16:1</a>) may suggest she was acquired during Abram and Sarai's sojourn in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10-20</a>). Her role as Sarai's servant is crucial, as it sets the stage for the conflict arising from Sarai's barrenness and her decision to give Hagar to Abram as a surrogate.<p><b>he said,</b><br>The speaker here is the Angel of the LORD, a significant figure in the Old Testament often associated with divine appearances. This encounter marks the first time the Angel of the LORD appears in Scripture, indicating the importance of Hagar's story. The Angel's presence suggests divine intervention and care, even for those on the margins of society, like Hagar.<p><b>where have you come from, and where are you going?</b><br>This question is both literal and metaphorical. Literally, it addresses Hagar's flight from Sarai, but metaphorically, it invites reflection on her past and future. The question implies a concern for Hagar's well-being and prompts her to consider her situation. It echoes God's inquiries in other biblical narratives, such as His questions to Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, highlighting a pattern of divine engagement with humanity.<p><b>I am running away from my mistress Sarai,</b><br>Hagar's response reveals her desperation and the conflict with Sarai. The term "mistress" underscores the hierarchical relationship and the tension resulting from Sarai's harsh treatment (<a href="/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>). Hagar's flight is an act of defiance and self-preservation, reflecting the broader theme of human struggle and divine oversight. This moment foreshadows future narratives of God's concern for the oppressed, as seen in the Exodus story where God hears the cries of the Israelites in bondage (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarai, who becomes pregnant by Abram.
