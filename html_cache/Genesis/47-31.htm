This request for an oath reflects the seriousness of his desire to be buried in the land of Canaan, the land promised to his descendants by God. The act of swearing an oath was a solemn and binding agreement in ancient Near Eastern culture, often invoking the name of God as a witness. This reflects the importance Jacob places on the covenant promises and his desire to be associated with the land of promise even in death.<p><b>So Joseph swore to him,</b><br>Joseph, as the favored son and a man of integrity, honors his father's request. His willingness to swear an oath demonstrates his respect for his father and his commitment to fulfilling Jacob's wishes. This act also signifies Joseph's acknowledgment of the importance of the covenant promises tied to the land of Canaan. Joseph's position in Egypt as a powerful leader does not diminish his connection to his heritage and the promises given to his forefathers.<p><b>and Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed.</b><br>The name "Israel" is used here, emphasizing Jacob's role as the patriarch of the nation. His act of bowing in worship signifies his deep faith and gratitude towards God for His faithfulness throughout his life. This moment of worship at the end of his life reflects Jacob's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises. The phrase "at the head of his bed" indicates Jacob's frailty and impending death, yet even in his weakness, he demonstrates a posture of reverence and trust in God. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His own death, demonstrated ultimate trust and submission to the Father's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is nearing the end of his life.

Keeping promises is a hallmark of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33&#8211;37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Israel&#8221; is Jacob&#8217;s covenant name (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>), and his bowing is an act of worship, not mere courtesy. The verse portrays a frail patriarch leaning on his bed (or staff) and giving thanks. <a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a> highlights this very moment as the climax of his faith.<p>&#8226; Bowing acknowledges God as the One who will fulfill the land promise (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>). He worships because the oath reassures him that, even in death, he will rest in the place God promised.<p>&#8226; Similar bedside worship scenes appear when David praises God on his deathbed (<a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a>) and when Hezekiah turns his face to the wall in prayer (<a href="/2_kings/20-2.htm">2 Kings 20:2</a>). Such moments show that true worship transcends physical weakness.<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s posture sets an example: even in decline, he responds to God with gratitude and trust (<a href="/psalms/71-17.htm">Psalm 71:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a> records a covenant moment between father and son that points beyond them to God&#8217;s faithfulness. Jacob demands and receives an oath that his body will rest in Canaan, thereby staking everything on God&#8217;s promise of the land. Joseph&#8217;s immediate agreement demonstrates obedient honor and shared confidence in the Lord. Jacob&#8217;s ensuing worship affirms that, though dying, he is still leaning on God&#8217;s certainty. The verse invites us to honor commitments, look beyond present circumstances, and worship God who keeps every promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.</span>--The LXX., followed by the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/genesis/11-21.htm" title="And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.">Genesis 11:21</a>) and the Syriac, read, "on the top of his staff." The word in the Hebrew, without vowels, may mean either <span class= "ital">bed </span>or <span class= "ital">staff, </span>and as we have mentioned above (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm" title="And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.">Genesis 22:14</a>), the points indicating the vowels were added in later times, and while valuable as representing a very ancient tradition, are nevertheless not of final authority. The rendering, however, of the Authorised Version is the most satisfactory. It was scarcely worth mentioning that Jacob bowed before Joseph, leaning on his staff; but the picture of the aged patriarch leaning back upon his bed, content and happy in his son's promise, and giving thanks to God for the peace of his approaching end, is one full of pathos and dignity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - And he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jacob) <span class="cmt_word">said, Swear unto me</span> (in the manner indicated in ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Joseph) <span class="cmt_word">sware unto him.
