This event follows Sarai's decision to give Hagar to Abram as a wife due to her own barrenness (<a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16:1-3</a>). The birth of Hagar's son marks a significant moment in biblical history, as it introduces Ishmael, the forefather of many Arab nations. The cultural practice of a maidservant bearing a child on behalf of her mistress was not uncommon in the ancient Near East, reflecting the societal norms and familial structures of the time.<p><b>and Abram gave the name Ishmael</b><br>The name Ishmael means "God hears," signifying God's response to Hagar's affliction and distress (<a href="/genesis/16-11.htm">Genesis 16:11</a>). This naming by Abram indicates his acceptance and recognition of the child as his own, despite the unconventional circumstances of his birth. The act of naming also reflects the patriarchal authority Abram holds within his family. Ishmael's name is a testament to God's providence and involvement in the lives of Abram and Hagar, as well as a foreshadowing of Ishmael's future as a significant figure in biblical history.<p><b>to the son she had borne</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Hagar's role as the biological mother of Ishmael, highlighting the fulfillment of the angel of the Lord's prophecy to her (<a href="/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10-11</a>). The acknowledgment of Hagar's motherhood is crucial, as it establishes Ishmael's lineage and his connection to Abram. The birth of Ishmael sets the stage for future tensions between his descendants and those of Isaac, Abram's son with Sarai, which are explored in later biblical narratives. This moment also underscores the complexity of God's promises to Abram, as Ishmael's birth precedes the covenantal promise of Isaac.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarai (later Sarah), who becomes the mother of Abram's first son, Ishmael.
