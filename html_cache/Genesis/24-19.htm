The act of giving a drink to a stranger reflects the biblical principle of showing love and care to others, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which encourages hospitality to strangers. This moment also sets the stage for the fulfillment of Abraham's servant's prayer for a sign, demonstrating God's providence and guidance in the selection of Isaac's wife.<p><b>she said,</b><br>Rebekah's initiative in speaking indicates her willingness and proactive nature. In the cultural context, women often played a significant role in managing household duties, including drawing water. Her readiness to speak and act aligns with the biblical portrayal of women like Ruth and Esther, who also took decisive actions that aligned with God's plans.<p><b>&#8220;I will also draw water for your camels,</b><br>This statement reveals Rebekah's extraordinary generosity and servant-heartedness. Drawing water for camels was a labor-intensive task, as a single camel could drink many gallons. Her offer goes beyond the expected hospitality, reflecting a heart of service and foreshadowing the qualities of a virtuous woman described in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>. This act also serves as a type of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>until they have had enough to drink.&#8221;</b><br>Rebekah's commitment to drawing water "until they have had enough" underscores her diligence and thoroughness. This mirrors the biblical principle of going the extra mile, as taught by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>. Her actions fulfill the servant's prayer for a sign, confirming her as God's chosen bride for Isaac. This moment can be seen as a foreshadowing of the abundant provision and care that God offers to His people, as seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A young woman of great kindness and hospitality, Rebekah is the daughter of Bethuel and becomes the wife of Isaac.

Once the traveler&#8217;s need is clear, she meets it immediately&#8212;just as her ancestor Abraham had hurried to refresh his angelic guests (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4-5</a>). Scripture repeatedly honors this swift, hands-on hospitality: &#8220;And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones&#8230; will never lose his reward&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> reminds us that some have &#8220;entertained angels unaware,&#8221; encouraging the same readiness to serve strangers.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Watchfulness&#8212;seeing a need is the first step.<p>&#8226; Prompt action&#8212;love that waits for perfect conditions usually never shows up (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she said</b><p>Her words flow naturally from her character.
