This moment fulfills the dreams Joseph had in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>, where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his. The recognition also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan for the family of Israel.<p><b>but he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them</b><br>Joseph's harsh treatment can be seen as a test of his brothers' character and repentance. It reflects the wisdom and discernment he has gained through his experiences in Egypt. This approach also serves to conceal his identity, allowing him to observe their behavior and intentions without bias. The harshness may also symbolize the severity of their past actions against him.<p><b>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221; he asked</b><br>This question serves both as a practical inquiry and a deeper probing into their motives. It reflects Joseph's cautiousness and desire to gather information about his family and the situation in Canaan. The question also echoes the theme of exile and return, as the brothers have come from the Promised Land to a foreign land in search of sustenance.<p><b>&#8220;From the land of Canaan,&#8221; they replied</b><br>Canaan is significant as the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. The mention of Canaan underscores the ongoing narrative of God's covenant with Abraham's lineage. It also highlights the dire circumstances in Canaan due to the famine, which has driven the brothers to seek help in Egypt, thus fulfilling God's plan to preserve the family through Joseph.<p><b>&#8220;We are here to buy food.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the brothers' immediate need and desperation due to the famine. It also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's provision through Joseph, who has been placed in a position to save not only Egypt but also his own family. The act of buying food symbolizes the physical and spiritual sustenance that God provides, foreshadowing the future provision through Christ, the Bread of Life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

The latter was, no doubt, the result of his great longing to see his only brother, and he may not have known how dear he was to Jacob, or have reflected upon the pain which his father would feel in parting with him. Still it was but a temporary separation, to prepare for a happy re-union. As regards his half-brethren, Joseph was obliged to prove them, and he did nothing to them which they did not richly deserve. From the first he probably wished to have his father and Benjamin to dwell with him, and share his good fortune; but if his brethren were still the cruel and heartless wretches which they had shown themselves to have been in their conduct to him twenty years before, we may well suppose that he would justly have left them to their fate. Possibly his first emotion towards them was one of indignation, but it melted away, when, even in but one of them, he saw proof that they were not entirely destitute of better feeling (see <a href="/genesis/42-22.htm" title="And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not to you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.">Genesis 42:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-24.htm" title="And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.">Genesis 42:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">made himself strange unto them</span>.
