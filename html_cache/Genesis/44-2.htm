Silver, often associated with wealth and purity, underscores the importance of the item. In ancient Egyptian culture, such a cup could be used for divination, a practice Joseph was accused of using (<a href="/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>). This sets the stage for testing his brothers' integrity and repentance.<p><b>in the mouth of the youngest one&#8217;s sack,</b><br>The youngest brother, Benjamin, is central to the narrative. His position as the youngest and most beloved by Jacob mirrors Joseph's former status in the family. This act of placing the cup in Benjamin's sack is a deliberate test of the brothers' loyalty and honesty. It recalls the earlier betrayal of Joseph, as the brothers must now decide whether to abandon Benjamin or protect him.<p><b>along with the silver for his grain.&#8221;</b><br>The inclusion of silver for grain payment highlights the theme of providence and God's provision. It also serves as a test of the brothers' honesty, as they had previously returned the silver found in their sacks (<a href="/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25-28</a>). This repetition emphasizes the importance of integrity and the consequences of past actions.<p><b>So the steward did as Joseph had instructed.</b><br>The steward's obedience to Joseph's command reflects Joseph's authority and the trust placed in him by Pharaoh. This act sets in motion the unfolding of God's plan for reconciliation and redemption within Jacob's family. It also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of Joseph's identity and the fulfillment of his dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), which were divinely inspired and prophetic.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who orchestrates the test of his brothers by placing his silver cup in Benjamin's sack.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob, who is unknowingly implicated in the theft of Joseph's cup.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_steward.htm">Joseph's Steward</a></b><br>The servant who carries out Joseph's instructions to place the cup in Benjamin's sack.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph has risen to power and where this event takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_sons.htm">Jacob's Sons</a></b><br>The brothers of Joseph, who are being tested to see if they have changed since selling Joseph into slavery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/testing_and_transformation.htm">Testing and Transformation</a></b><br>Joseph's test of his brothers is a means to reveal their character and transformation.
