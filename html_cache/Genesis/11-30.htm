It was a significant issue because lineage and inheritance were crucial in maintaining family legacy and property. Sarai's barrenness sets the stage for God's miraculous intervention, highlighting His sovereignty and power over human limitations. This theme of barrenness followed by divine intervention is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as Hannah (1 Samuel 1) and Elizabeth (Luke 1), emphasizing God's ability to bring life where there is none.<p><b>she had no children.</b><br>This phrase underscores the reality of Sarai's situation and the human impossibility of fulfilling God's promise to Abram of becoming a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). It sets the stage for the unfolding of God's covenant with Abram, where He promises descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The absence of children also foreshadows the miraculous birth of Isaac, a type of Christ, as both are born under extraordinary circumstances. Isaac's birth is a precursor to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual descendants to Abraham through faith (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarai.htm">Sarai</a></b><br>The wife of Abram (later Abraham), Sarai is a central figure in the account of Genesis.

While families are growing, Sarai&#8217;s story pauses.<p>&#8226; Sarai herself is introduced earlier in <a href="/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>; a spotlight now rests on her. In <a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15</a>, God will rename her Sarah, marking a turning point.<p>&#8226; Her place beside Abram matters. <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> shows that through Abram all nations will be blessed, so whatever affects Sarai directly impacts that promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was barren</b><p>&#8226; Scripture states her condition plainly and without blame: &#8220;was barren.&#8221; Infertility in the ancient world carried social shame (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6-7</a> with Hannah), yet the text is compassionate, not accusatory.<p>&#8226; God often works through barrenness to display His power: Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>), Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>), Manoah&#8217;s wife (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2-3</a>), Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7, 24</a>-25). Each example highlights that children are ultimately a gift from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Sarai&#8217;s barrenness sets the stage for a miracle that only God can accomplish, underscoring <a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a> where Abram&#8217;s faith faces &#8220;the deadness of Sarah&#8217;s womb.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She had no children</b><p>&#8226; The repetition intensifies the reality&#8212;there is not even one child.
