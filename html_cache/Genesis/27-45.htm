In the cultural context of the time, blessings were highly significant and often seen as irrevocable, leading to intense familial conflict. The idea of waiting for anger to subside is a common biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, which speaks to the power of a gentle answer to turn away wrath.<p><b>and he forgets what you have done to him.</b><br>Forgetting in this context implies a lessening of the emotional intensity rather than literal amnesia. The biblical narrative often emphasizes reconciliation and forgiveness, as seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers in <a href="/genesis/50-15.htm">Genesis 50:15-21</a>. The hope is for Esau to move past the betrayal, similar to how God calls believers to forgive others.<p><b>Then I will send for you and bring you back from there.</b><br>Rebekah's plan involves sending Jacob away to her brother Laban in Haran, a place of refuge. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using periods of exile or separation for growth and protection, as seen in the Israelites' time in Egypt. The promise to bring Jacob back foreshadows his eventual return and the continuation of God's covenant promises through him.<p><b>Why should I lose both of you in one day?&#8221;</b><br>Rebekah fears losing both her sons&#8212;Esau through his potential actions against Jacob, and Jacob if Esau seeks vengeance. This reflects the deep familial bonds and the high stakes of the situation. The phrase underscores the theme of familial preservation and the lengths to which individuals will go to protect their loved ones, reminiscent of the protective actions of Moses' mother in <a href="/exodus/2.htm">Exodus 2:1-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The mother of Esau and Jacob, who orchestrates Jacob's deception to receive Isaac's blessing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who deceives his father to receive the blessing meant for Esau.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is angered by Jacob's deception and plans to kill him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The father of Esau and Jacob, who is deceived by Jacob into giving him the blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/haran.htm">Haran</a></b><br>The place where Rebekah plans to send Jacob to escape Esau's wrath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Deception can lead to broken relationships and long-lasting consequences.

Even Cain&#8217;s wrath took time to build before he attacked Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By sending Jacob away to Haran, she buys time for emotions to cool and for God&#8217;s larger plan to unfold (compare <a href="/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he forgets what you have done to him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Forget&#8221; here speaks of the sting of betrayal fading, not literal amnesia. Jacob&#8217;s deception wounded Esau deeply (<a href="/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>), but wounds can heal when they are no longer freshly provoked (<a href="/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Rebekah&#8217;s hope rests on the reality that God can soften even hardened hearts, just as He later reconciled Jacob and Esau in <a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores personal responsibility: Jacob&#8217;s wrongdoing cannot be excused, but genuine repentance plus the passage of time may open the door to forgiveness (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then I will send for you and bring you back from there</b><p>&#8226; Rebekah offers a concrete promise&#8212;Jacob&#8217;s exile is meant to be temporary. Twenty years later, God Himself echoes this assurance: &#8220;Return to the land of your fathers&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Her words reveal faith that the covenant line must remain intact. Jacob is heir to God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>), so his eventual return is essential.<p>&#8226; This line also foreshadows God&#8217;s pattern of calling His people out and then bringing them back (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why should I lose both of you in one day?</b><p>&#8226; If Esau kills Jacob, Esau may himself be executed under God&#8217;s principle in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> or face divine judgment, leaving Rebekah bereft of both sons at once (compare <a href="/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Her question captures a mother&#8217;s anguish and highlights how sin threatens an entire family, not just the immediate offender (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The line also hints at the high stakes of God&#8217;s redemptive plan: losing Jacob would jeopardize the lineage through which Messiah will eventually come (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-45.htm">Genesis 27:45</a> records Rebekah&#8217;s urgent instructions to Jacob. She sends him away to allow Esau&#8217;s anger to cool, trusting that time and God&#8217;s grace will lead to reconciliation. Her promise to recall Jacob shows confidence that God&#8217;s covenant purposes will prevail, while her fear of losing both sons underscores how unchecked sin can devastate a family. The verse therefore illustrates divine sovereignty working through imperfect people, the power of time to temper wrath, and the protective care God extends to preserve His redemptive plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your brother&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
