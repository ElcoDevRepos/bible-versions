The mention of physicians indicates the advanced medical practices in Egypt, known for their expertise in embalming and medicine. This reflects Joseph's integration into Egyptian society while maintaining his Hebrew identity. The use of physicians rather than priests for embalming suggests a practical approach, as priests typically performed religious rites. Joseph's authority allowed him to command such services, highlighting his influential position.<p><b>to embalm his father Israel</b><br>Embalming was a common practice in ancient Egypt, aimed at preserving the body for the afterlife, reflecting Egyptian beliefs about immortality. However, for Jacob (Israel), the embalming served a practical purpose: to preserve his body for transport back to Canaan for burial, as he had requested. This act shows Joseph's respect for his father's wishes and adherence to familial and cultural traditions. The embalming of Jacob also signifies the blending of Hebrew customs with Egyptian practices, as embalming was not a traditional Hebrew practice.<p><b>So they embalmed him</b><br>The embalming process in Egypt was elaborate, involving the removal of internal organs, drying the body with natron, and wrapping it in linen. This process could take up to 70 days, aligning with the mourning period mentioned later in the chapter. The successful embalming of Jacob ensured his body could be transported without decay, fulfilling his desire to be buried in the family tomb in Canaan. This act of embalming, while Egyptian in nature, facilitated the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land of Canaan, as Jacob's burial there reaffirmed the connection to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob (Israel) and Rachel, who rose to power in Egypt.

It was also usual at that period to embalm the dead; and during the many centuries while the custom lasted, from B.C. 2000 to A.D. 700, it is calculated that no less than 420,000,000 bodies were thus preserved. For the process, which was very expensive if done in the best manner, see Rawlinson, <span class= "ital">Egypt, </span>i. 511 ff. The embalmers are not generally called physicians, but probably what is meant is that the embalming of Jacob's body was superintended by the physicians attached to Joseph's household. Egypt was famous for its physicians, who were in advance of those of other countries, and were subdivided into classes, which had each the charge of some special disease. (See Rawlinson as above, i. 305 ff.) Mas-pero thinks that their real knowledge was inconsiderable, and that there were specialists only for the eyes, and one or two similar diseases (<span class= "ital">Hist. Anc. </span>82). Ophthalmia continues to be one of the most common diseases of Egypt.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the healers</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, to sew together, to mend, hence to heal, a class of persons which abounded in Ancient Egypt, each physician being only qualified to treat a single disorder (Herod., 2:84). The medical men of Egypt were held in high repute abroad, and their assistance was at various times required by persons from other countries, as, e.g., Cyrus and Darius (Herod., 3:1, 132). Their knowledge of medicines was extensive, and is referred to both in sacred (Jeremiah 66:11) and profane (Homer, 'Odyssey" 4 . 229) writings. The Egyptian doctors belonged to the sacerdotal order, and were expected to know all things relating to the body, and diseases and remedies contained in the six last of the sacred books of Hermes. According to Pliny (7:56), the study of medicine originated in Egypt (<span class="accented">vide</span> Wilkinson in Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol 2. pp. 116, 117). The physicians employed by Joseph were those attached to his own household, or the court practitioners - <span class="cmt_word">to embalm his father:</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to spice or season</span> (the body of) his father, i.e. to prepare it for burial by means of aromatics; <span class="accented">ut aromatibus condirent</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.), which is putting part of a proceeding for the whole (Tayler Lewis). According to Herodotus (2:86), the embalmers belonged to a distinct hereditary class or guild from the ordinary physicians; but either their formation into such a separate order of practitioners was of later origin (Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Kalisch), or Jacob was embalmed by the physicians instead of the embalmers proper because, not being an Egyptian, he could not be subjected to the ordinary treatment of the embalming art ('Speaker's Commentary') - <span class="cmt_word">and the physicians embalmed Israel.</span> The method of preparing mummies in Ancient Egypt has been elaborately described, both by Herodotus (2:86) and Diodorus Sieulus (1:91), and, in the main, the accuracy of their descriptions has been confirmed by the evidence derived from the mummies themselves. According to the most expensive process, which cost one talent of silver, or about &pound;250 sterling, the brain was first extracted through the nostrils by means of a crooked piece of iron, the skull being thoroughly cleansed of any remaining portions by rinsing with drugs; then, through an opening in the left side made with a sharp Ethiopian knife of agate or of flint, the viscera were removed, the abdomen being afterwards purified with palm wine and an infusion of aromatics; next, the disemboweled corpse was filled with every sort of spicery except frankincense, and the opening sewed up; after that the stuffed form was steeped for seventy days in natrum or subcarbonate of soda obtained from the Libyan desert, and sometimes in wax and tanning, bitumen also being employed in later times; and finally, on the expiration of that <span class="accented">period</span>, which was scrupulously observed, the body was washed, wrapped about with linen bandages, smeared over with gum, decorated with amulets, sometimes with a network of porcelain bugles, covered with a linen shroud, and, in due course, transferred to a mummy case (<span class="accented">vide</span> Wilkinson's 'Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 471, ed. 1878;
