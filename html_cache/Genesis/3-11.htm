Prior to eating the forbidden fruit, they were naked and unashamed (<a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>). The question implies that their awareness of nakedness came from an external source, indicating a shift in their understanding and innocence. This moment marks the entrance of sin into the human experience, bringing shame and guilt. Theologically, it underscores the loss of innocence and the beginning of human self-consciousness and moral awareness.<p><b>asked the LORD God.</b><br>The use of "LORD God" combines the covenant name of God, Yahweh, with Elohim, emphasizing both His personal relationship with humanity and His sovereign authority. This duality reflects God's intimate involvement with His creation and His role as the ultimate judge. The question is not for God's information but to prompt Adam and Eve to self-reflection and confession, a pattern seen throughout Scripture where God asks questions to lead individuals to truth and repentance (e.g., Cain in <a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>).<p><b>Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?</b><br>This direct question addresses the act of disobedience. The tree represents God's command and the boundary set for Adam and Eve. Eating from it was a direct violation of God's explicit command in <a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16-17</a>. This act of disobedience is the original sin, introducing sin and death into the world (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). Theologically, it sets the stage for the need for redemption, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the second Adam, who obeys God perfectly (<a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>). The question also highlights human responsibility and accountability before God, a theme that runs throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is omniscient and omnipresent, questioning Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, who has disobeyed God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eve.htm">Eve</a></b><br>The first woman, created from Adam, who also disobeyed God's command.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The perfect place created by God for Adam and Eve to live in harmony with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil.htm">The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></b><br>The specific tree in the Garden that God commanded Adam and Eve not to eat from.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God knows all things, including our thoughts and actions.

Similar moments appear when conviction comes: &#8220;When He comes, He will convict the world regarding sin&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>).<p>&#8226; No one had &#8220;told&#8221; them; disobedience awakened an inner alarm. &#8220;Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s inquiry invites confession, offering a path back, just as He later invites Israel: &#8220;Come now, let us reason together&#8230; though your sins are scarlet, they shall be as white as snow&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a> pictures the same blindness: &#8220;You do not realize that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked.&#8221; Sin strips, and only God can clothe (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>asked the LORD God.</b><p>&#8226; The covenant name LORD (YHWH) highlights a personal, relational Creator who seeks the sinner.

And as long as a man feels sorrow only for the results of his actions there is no repentance, and no wish to return to the Divine presence. God, therefore, in order to win Adam back to better thoughts, carries his mind from the effect to the sin that had caused it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>.
