This moment is significant as it marks a turning point in Jacob's life, where he begins to assert his independence from Laban. The act of speaking to his wives indicates a family decision, emphasizing the importance of unity and shared purpose in the family structure.<p><b>I can see from your father&#8217;s countenance</b><br>Jacob observes Laban's facial expressions and demeanor, which reflect his inner feelings. In ancient Near Eastern culture, non-verbal communication was as significant as verbal communication. The countenance often revealed one's true intentions or feelings, which could not be hidden. This insight into Laban's attitude is crucial for Jacob's decision-making process.<p><b>that his attitude toward me has changed</b><br>Laban's change in attitude is a result of Jacob's prosperity, which has come at Laban's expense. Historically, this reflects the tension between employer and employee, or family members, when wealth and success are involved. The change in attitude also highlights the theme of envy and the resulting relational strife, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the story of Cain and Abel.<p><b>but the God of my father has been with me</b><br>Jacob acknowledges the divine presence and protection that has been with him throughout his time with Laban. This reference to "the God of my father" connects Jacob to the covenantal promises given to Abraham and Isaac, emphasizing the continuity of God's faithfulness across generations. It also foreshadows the later reaffirmation of God's covenant with Jacob, reinforcing the idea that God is actively involved in the lives of His chosen people.
