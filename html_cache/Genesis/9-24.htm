Noah, a man of faith who found favor with God and survived the Flood, succumbed to the effects of wine. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of overindulgence and the potential for sin even among the faithful. The Bible often warns against drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>), emphasizing the need for self-control. Noah's vineyard and subsequent intoxication mark the first mention of wine in Scripture, setting a precedent for its complex role in biblical narratives.<p><b>and learned what his youngest son had done to him,</b><br>The phrase refers to Ham's actions, which are interpreted as disrespectful and dishonorable. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, honoring one's parents was a fundamental value, and Ham's behavior was a serious breach of familial duty. The term "youngest son" is significant, as it highlights the dynamics within Noah's family and the subsequent curse on Canaan, Ham's son. This incident foreshadows the future tensions between the descendants of Ham and those of Shem and Japheth. The narrative also connects to the broader biblical theme of sin's consequences, as seen in the curses and blessings that follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Noah is a righteous man chosen by God to survive the Flood and repopulate the earth.

So it is applied to Benjamin in <a href="/genesis/42-34.htm" title="And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that you are no spies, but that you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you shall traffic in the land.">Genesis 42:34</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-29.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.">Genesis 43:29</a>, and to David in <a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm" title="And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here.">1Samuel 16:11</a>, where the words literally are, <span class= "ital">there re- maineth yet the little one. </span>Now Ham was not the youngest son, but Japheth; and it is not Ham who is cursed, but Canaan. So far from Ham being accursed, his descendants were building mighty cities, such as Egyptian Thebes, Nineveh, and Babylon, were rearing palaces, digging canals, organising governments, and founding empires at a time when the descendants of Japheth were wandering over Europe with no better weapons than implements of flint and bone. The application of the curse to Ham seems to have been suggested to commentators by the degradation of the African race in modern times, and especially by the prevalence of  slavery: but anciently the converse was the case, and for centuries the Egyptians, a Hamite race, made the Israelites serve them.<p>We must not extend, therefore, to Ham the curse pronounced upon Canaan. But what had Canaan done to deserve it? As <span class= "ital">the son, the little one, </span>was not Ham, so certainly it was not Japheth, but probably it was Canaan. He was the youngest son of Ham, and in Hebrew "son" is occasionally used for grandson (<a href="/genesis/29-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.">Genesis 29:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-55.htm" title="And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.">Genesis 31:55</a>), and so he might be described as Noah's youngest son, being the youngest member of his family. Origen quotes a tradition that Canaan was the first who saw Noah's exposure, and that he told it to his father. Aben Ezra says that Canaan had done worse than mock, though the Scripture does not in words reveal his crime. With some such surmise we must be content; and the meaning seems to be, "Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what (Canaan) his youngest son (or grandson) had done unto him; and it was a deed so shameless that he said, 'Cursed be Canaan.'" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Noah awoke from his wine</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the effects of his wine (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/1-14.htm">1 Samuel 1:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-37.htm">1 Samuel 25:37</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> (LXX.); "became fully conscious of his condition" (T.

Generally believed to have been Ham, though by many Canaan is understood (Aben Ezra, Theodoret, Procopius, Scaliger, Poole, Jamieson, Inglis, Lewis). Origen mentions a tradition that Canaan first saw the shame of Noah, and told it to his father. Wordsworth, following Chrysostom, believes Canaan may have been an accomplice. 'The Speaker's Commentary' thinks it would solve the difficulty which attaches to the cursing of Canaan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/9-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Noah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1430;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5146.htm">Strong's 5146: </a> </span><span class="str2">Noah -- 'rest', patriarch who survived the flood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">awoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1511;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#238;&#183;qe&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
