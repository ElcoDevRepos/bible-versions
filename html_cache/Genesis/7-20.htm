This event foreshadows future judgments, such as those described in Revelation, where water is often a symbol of chaos and divine wrath.<p><b>and covered the mountaintops</b><br>The covering of the mountaintops signifies the completeness of the flood, leaving no part of the earth untouched. This detail underscores the universality of the flood, as even the highest geographical points were submerged. The mountains, often seen as symbols of stability and permanence, being covered, highlights the overwhelming power of God's judgment. This can be compared to other biblical instances where mountains are significant, such as Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) and Mount Zion (<a href="/psalms/125.htm">Psalm 125:1</a>), representing God's presence and protection.<p><b>to a depth of fifteen cubits</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters, making fifteen cubits approximately 22.5 feet or 6.75 meters. This specific measurement indicates that the waters were deep enough to ensure the complete destruction of all life outside the ark, as described in <a href="/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>. The precision of this detail reflects the thoroughness of God's judgment. The number fifteen, while not as symbolically significant as other biblical numbers, still emphasizes the sufficiency of the floodwaters to accomplish God's purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons /

forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and the waters rose and lifted the ark high above the earth&#8221;. The repeated statement that the waters &#8220;rose&#8221; stresses unstoppable, divinely driven judgment, echoing <a href="/job/12-15.htm">Job 12:15</a> where the Lord &#8220;releases&#8221; waters that &#8220;overwhelm the earth.&#8221;<p>- This is not regional or symbolic; the rising waters display God&#8217;s power over the entire creation, anticipating Peter&#8217;s reminder that &#8220;the world of that time perished, having been deluged with water&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-6.htm">2 Peter 3:6</a>).<p>- For Noah&#8217;s family, the rising waters underscore God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;He warned, provided an ark (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14&#8211;16</a>), and now proves His word true (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Covered the mountaintops</b><p>- <a href="/genesis/7-19.htm">Genesis 7:19</a> emphasizes, &#8220;all the high mountains under all the heavens were covered&#8221;. By pairing &#8220;all&#8221; with &#8220;under all the heavens,&#8221; the text rules out a local flood and affirms a global scope.<p>- <a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6&#8211;9</a> poetically recalls the same scene: &#8220;You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.&#8221; God&#8217;s sovereignty extends to the highest peaks; nothing escapes His judgment.<p>- Jesus later uses this very flood to warn of coming judgment (<a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37&#8211;39</a>). If the mountains were covered once, final judgment will be just as comprehensive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To a depth of fifteen cubits</b><p>- A cubit is roughly 18 inches, so fifteen cubits equal about 22 feet (6.7 m). That depth matters for at least two reasons:<p>&#8226; It assures enough clearance for the ark&#8212;whose draft would have been less than fifteen cubits (compare the ark&#8217;s 30-cubit height in <a href="/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>)&#8212;to float safely above every summit.<p>&#8226; It supplies a measurable, historical detail, reinforcing that this account is literal, eyewitness history, not myth.<p>- The ark&#8217;s eventual landing &#8220;on the mountains of Ararat&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>) confirms that the vessel indeed passed above even the highest ridges before the waters receded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/7-20.htm">Genesis 7:20</a> records that floodwaters climbed high enough to submerge every mountain by about twenty-two feet, proving a worldwide judgment exactly as God had warned. The verse underlines the Lord&#8217;s total control over creation, the reliability of His word, and the safety He provides to those who trust Him&#8212;as Noah did in the ark, so we do in Christ today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Fifteen cubits upward.</span>--This apparently was the draught of the ark, computed after it had settled. in the region of Ararat. Fifteen cubits would be about twenty-two feet, and as the ark floated onward without interruption until it finally grounded, there must have been this depth of water even on the highest summit in its course. Continuous rains for forty days and nights would scarcely produce so vast a mass of water, unless we suppose that the <span class= "ital">adamah </span>was some low-lying spot of ground whither the waters from many regions flowed together; but this is negatived by the ark having travelled into Armenia. In England the whole average mean rainfall in a year is not more than twenty-eight or thirty inches in depth. If we suppose this amount to have fallen in every twenty-four hours, the total quantity would be about 100 feet. Such a rain would denude the mountains of all soil, uproot all trees, sweep away all buildings, dig out new courses for the rivers, completely alter the whole surface of the ground, and cover the lower lands with debris. Wherever there was any obstacle in their way, the waters would deepen in volume, and quickly burst a passage through it. But as they would be seeking the lower grounds during the whole forty days, it is difficult to understand how they could cover any of the heights to the depth of twenty-two feet, unless there were some cosmic convulsion (see Note on <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>), by which the waters from the equator were carried towards the poles, and in this way there would be no difficulty in the ark being carried against the current of the Tigris and Euphrates up to the high lands of Armenia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fifteen cubits upward</span> - half the height of the ark - <span class="cmt_word">did the waters prevail</span>.
