This is outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>, where a brother is expected to marry the widow of his deceased brother to produce offspring in his name. Onan's awareness that the offspring would not be considered his own reflects his understanding of this cultural and legal obligation. This practice was crucial for maintaining family inheritance and lineage, which were vital in the tribal structure of Israel.<p><b>so whenever he would sleep with his brother&#8217;s wife,</b><br>Onan's actions are set against the backdrop of familial duty and covenantal responsibility. The act of sleeping with his brother's wife, Tamar, was not merely a personal choice but a fulfillment of a societal and religious duty. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's laws and the importance of family loyalty and honor.<p><b>he would spill his seed on the ground</b><br>This deliberate act of contraception was a direct violation of the levirate marriage duty. In the biblical narrative, this act is seen as a willful disobedience to God's command and a selfish refusal to honor his brother's memory. The spilling of seed is symbolic of Onan's rejection of God's provision and plan for family and inheritance, which is a recurring theme in the Bible where disobedience leads to divine displeasure.<p><b>so that he would not produce offspring for his brother.</b><br>Onan's refusal to produce offspring for his brother highlights his self-interest and disregard for familial obligations. This act is condemned in the narrative as it goes against the divine order and the preservation of the family line, which is a significant theme throughout the Old Testament. The importance of lineage is seen in the genealogies that lead to the birth of Jesus Christ, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through specific family lines. Onan's actions are a stark contrast to the faithfulness expected of God's people, and his story serves as a warning against selfishness and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/onan.htm">Onan</a></b><br>The second son of Judah, who was instructed to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to Tamar, his deceased brother Er's widow, by providing offspring for his brother.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The widow of Er, Onan's brother, who was to be given offspring through Onan according to the custom of levirate marriage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The father of Er and Onan, who instructed Onan to fulfill his duty to Tamar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levirate_marriage.htm">Levirate Marriage</a></b><br>A cultural practice where a man is required to marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in the brother's name.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The region where these events took place, highlighting the cultural and familial obligations of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_duty_and_responsibility.htm">Understanding Duty and Responsibility</a></b><br>Onan's actions reflect a failure to fulfill his familial and cultural responsibilities.
