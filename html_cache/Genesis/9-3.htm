Before the flood, humans were primarily given plants for food (<a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>). The post-flood world introduces a new allowance for consuming animal flesh. This change may reflect the altered ecological conditions after the flood, where plant life was temporarily scarce. The phrase "everything that lives and moves" indicates a broad permission, suggesting that all types of animals are included. This can be seen as a divine provision for sustenance in a changed world. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty over creation and His authority to set the terms of human interaction with it.<p><b>just as I gave you the green plants,</b><br>This comparison to the original provision of plants in <a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a> highlights continuity and change in God's provision. It suggests that just as God provided plants for sustenance, He now extends that provision to include animals. This reflects God's ongoing care and provision for human needs. The reference to "green plants" also serves as a reminder of the original creation order and the harmony that existed before the fall. It emphasizes that God's provision is both generous and sufficient, adapting to the needs of humanity in different contexts.<p><b>I now give you all things.</b><br>The phrase "I now give you all things" signifies a comprehensive grant of resources for human survival and flourishing. This echoes the dominion mandate in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given stewardship over creation. It implies a responsibility to use these resources wisely and ethically. Theologically, it points to God's grace and generosity, providing abundantly for human needs. This provision can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate provision for humanity's spiritual needs. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), fulfilling the deepest needs of humanity.

(<a href="/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>), underscoring a new relationship between people and animals.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/10-12.htm">Acts 10:12</a> echoes this breadth&#8212;&#8220;all kinds of four-footed animals&#8230;
