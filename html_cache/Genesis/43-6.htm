This reflects Jacob's ongoing struggle with fear and anxiety, a recurring theme in his life. Historically, Jacob's life was marked by numerous trials, including his flight from Esau, his dealings with Laban, and the loss of Joseph, whom he believed to be dead. This question reveals Jacob's human frailty and his tendency to focus on immediate circumstances rather than God's overarching plan. It also highlights the familial tensions and the weight of responsibility Jacob feels as the patriarch of his family.<p><b>Israel asked.</b><br>The use of the name "Israel" instead of "Jacob" is significant. "Israel" is the name given to Jacob after wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>), symbolizing his role as the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. This duality in names often reflects the tension between his old nature (Jacob) and his new identity (Israel). In this context, it underscores the gravity of the situation, as the future of the Israelite nation is at stake. The patriarch's questioning also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>&#8220;Why did you tell the man you had another brother?&#8221;</b><br>This question points to the brothers' encounter with Joseph in Egypt, where they were compelled to reveal the existence of Benjamin, their youngest brother. Culturally, the brothers' honesty can be seen as a necessary step in the unfolding of God's plan, despite Jacob's immediate concern. The mention of "another brother" is crucial, as Benjamin is the only other son of Rachel, Jacob's beloved wife, and holds a special place in Jacob's heart. This situation sets the stage for the testing of the brothers' character and the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of Christ, where Joseph, like Jesus, tests and ultimately forgives those who wronged him, leading to reconciliation and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite nation, father of the twelve tribes.

The famine has already pressed the family (<a href="/genesis/42-1.htm">Genesis 42:1-2</a>), and now Simeon is detained. Jacob feels the cumulative weight of grief over Joseph&#8217;s presumed death (42:36), Simeon&#8217;s captivity (42:36), and the risk to Benjamin.<p>&#8226; The phrase signals a parent&#8217;s instinctive reaction when danger touches his children&#8212;the same protective impulse seen earlier when Jacob feared Esau (<a href="/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Trouble here points to external pressure under God&#8217;s providence. Scripture often portrays hardship as something God uses for refinement (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>), even when it feels overwhelming in the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel asked.</b><p>&#8226; Moses alternates the names &#8220;Jacob&#8221; and &#8220;Israel&#8221; to highlight both the man&#8217;s humanity and his covenant identity. &#8220;Israel&#8221; recalls God&#8217;s promise at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10-12</a>): a nation would come from him, and kings would spring from his line.<p>&#8226; The covenant name underscores that these events are not random; they unfold within God&#8217;s redemptive plan. What appears as personal calamity is advancing the promise of preservation (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; This subtle narrative choice reminds readers that God&#8217;s faithfulness stands even when His people wrestle with fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why did you tell the man you had another brother?</b><p>&#8226; Jacob fixates on the immediate cause: the brothers&#8217; disclosure of Benjamin. Yet their honesty was compelled (<a href="/genesis/43-7.htm">Genesis 43:7</a>). The question exposes Jacob&#8217;s limited perspective, while God is orchestrating a greater good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The tension highlights two themes:<p>&#8211; Human responsibility&#8212;Joseph&#8217;s brothers had to speak truthfully (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>).<p>&#8211; Divine sovereignty&#8212;God uses their truthful answer to reunite the family and preserve the covenant line (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear elsewhere, where obedience leads first to hardship, then to deliverance (<a href="/exodus/5-22.htm">Exodus 5:22-6</a>:1; <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s anguished questions reveal a father struggling with fear, yet bearing the covenant name &#8220;Israel,&#8221; anchoring him in God&#8217;s unbreakable promises. His sons&#8217; honesty, though it deepens the crisis, becomes the means God employs to save the family. <a href="/genesis/43-6.htm">Genesis 43:6</a> therefore illustrates how genuine faith can coexist with real anxiety, and how God works through even reluctant trust to accomplish His faithful purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel said</span>, - this is the second time that Jacob is so designated in the history of Joseph, the first time being in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>, which recites the sad account of Joseph's disappearance from the family circle.
