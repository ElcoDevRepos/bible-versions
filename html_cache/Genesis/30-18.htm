Her role in the narrative is significant as she is the mother of six of the twelve tribes of Israel. Leah's statement reflects her ongoing struggle for her husband Jacob's affection, which is a recurring theme in her story. Her words often reveal her deep desire for love and recognition within her family dynamics.<p><b>&#8220;God has rewarded me</b><br>Leah attributes the birth of her son to divine intervention, acknowledging God's role in her life. This reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and involvement in human affairs, a common theme throughout the Bible. Leah's understanding of reward here is tied to her actions and the cultural context of her time, where children were seen as a blessing and a sign of favor from God.<p><b>for giving my maidservant to my husband.&#8221;</b><br>This refers to the practice of surrogate motherhood, which was culturally accepted in the ancient Near East. Leah gave her maidservant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife to bear children on her behalf, similar to the earlier account of Sarah and Hagar. This practice highlights the importance of lineage and inheritance in biblical times, as well as the lengths to which individuals would go to secure their family's future.<p><b>So she named him Issachar.</b><br>The name Issachar is significant and is often interpreted to mean "reward" or "there is recompense." Naming in the Bible often reflects circumstances of birth or prophetic insights into the child's future. Issachar would become one of the tribes of Israel, known for its agricultural prosperity and later, its role in supporting King David. The naming of Issachar ties back to Leah's perception of divine reward and her ongoing narrative of seeking validation and blessing through her children.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is the sister of Rachel.

She sees every birth as evidence that the LORD notices her.<p>&#8226; By framing the moment with her own voice, Scripture highlights both her faith and her very human longing for affirmation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God has rewarded me</b><p>&#8226; Leah credits the LORD, not chance, for her new son, underscoring divine sovereignty in family matters (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;rewarded&#8221; shows she views God as attentive and responsive.

In that culture, a wife could claim her servant&#8217;s children as her own (cf. <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a> with Hagar and Sarah).<p>&#8226; She interprets her present blessing as divine approval of that act. Scripture records her perception without endorsing every motive behind it; God often blesses despite human imperfection (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment reminds us that while choices have consequences, God&#8217;s overarching plan is never thwarted (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So she named him Issachar</b><p>&#8226; Naming in Scripture frequently marks spiritual insight or personal testimony (<a href="/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Issachar&#8221; sounds like &#8220;wages&#8221; or &#8220;reward,&#8221; forever linking the child to Leah&#8217;s conviction that God repays faithfulness (cf. <a href="/ruth/2-12.htm">Ruth 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The tribe that descends from Issachar later receives fertile territory in Canaan (<a href="/joshua/19-17.htm">Joshua 19:17&#8211;23</a>), echoing the theme of divine provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Leah&#8217;s declaration in <a href="/genesis/30-18.htm">Genesis 30:18</a> captures her belief that God actively notices, values, and recompenses her.

In her eyes the birth of her fifth son was a Divine reward for the self-sacrifice involved in giving her maid to Jacob, and which had been followed by years of neglect of herself. As, too, it is said that "God hearkened unto Leah," we may feel sure that she had prayed for God's blessing upon her re-union with her husband; for Calvin's objection that prayer would scarcely accompany such odious courses has little weight. Leah and Rachel were uneducated and untrained country women, whose sole anxiety was to have offspring. Leah was the most religious and best disciplined of the two; and the shame ideally was that she should have been forced thus to buy her husband's attentions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Leah said, God</span> - Elohim;
