Leah, who felt unloved compared to her sister Rachel, had been praying for more children. The concept of God "listening" suggests a personal relationship and responsiveness to human needs, a recurring theme in the Bible. This mirrors other instances where God listens to the cries of His people, such as in <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>, when He hears the groaning of the Israelites in Egypt. It underscores the belief that God is attentive to the prayers of the faithful.<p><b>and she conceived</b><br>The act of conception is often seen as a blessing from God in the biblical narrative. In the cultural context of the time, bearing children, especially sons, was a significant source of a woman's value and status. Leah's ability to conceive again is seen as a sign of God's continued blessing upon her, despite her lower status in Jacob's affections. This also reflects the biblical theme of God using those who are marginalized or less favored to fulfill His purposes, as seen with other figures like David and Joseph.<p><b>and bore a fifth son to Jacob</b><br>The birth of Leah's fifth son, Issachar, is significant in the context of the ongoing rivalry between Leah and Rachel. Each son born to Jacob contributes to the formation of the twelve tribes of Israel, which are central to the narrative of the Old Testament. The naming of Issachar, which means "reward" or "compensation," reflects Leah's belief that God has rewarded her for giving her maidservant to Jacob as a wife. This event is part of the larger narrative of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising numerous descendants and a great nation. The birth of each son is a step toward the fulfillment of this promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is often seen as the less favored wife compared to her sister Rachel.

Scripture notes earlier, &#8220;When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;listening&#8221; marks personal attention: He hears cries of the afflicted (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Leah&#8217;s experience mirrors Hannah&#8217;s: &#8220;The LORD remembered her&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19</a>). God&#8217;s response underscores that prayer and providence work together; He remains involved in family stories and national destinies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she conceived</b><p>&#8226; Conception is presented as a direct act of God, not random biology. &#8220;Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; From Eve onward (&#8220;With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>), Scripture frames every child as divine gift.

Though ninth in Jacob&#8217;s total lineup, he confirms that Leah remains an essential matriarch.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;fifth&#8221; signals more than numbers; it testifies that God&#8217;s blessings keep coming despite human rivalry. Leah&#8217;s naming of Issachar (&#8220;God has rewarded me&#8221;) shows gratitude for grace beyond her own schemes.<p>&#8226; The tribe descending from Issachar later receives Moses&#8217; blessing: &#8220;Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>), illustrating how this birth ripples through Israel&#8217;s future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jacob</b><p>&#8226; The covenant line hinges on Jacob, heir of Abraham&#8217;s promises (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>).
