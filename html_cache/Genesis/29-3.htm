Wells were often shared resources, and shepherds would gather their flocks together to ensure fair access to water. This practice highlights the importance of cooperation and community in pastoral life. The gathering of flocks can also be seen as a metaphor for unity and collective provision, themes that resonate throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>, which speaks of the goodness of brethren dwelling together in unity.<p><b>the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well</b><br>The stone covering the well served as a protective measure to prevent contamination and unauthorized access. Rolling away the stone required collective effort, symbolizing the need for cooperation among the shepherds. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who rolled away the stone from His own tomb, signifying victory over death and providing living water to all who believe (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>). The removal of the stone also signifies access to life-sustaining resources, paralleling the spiritual nourishment found in Christ.<p><b>and water the sheep</b><br>Watering the sheep was a critical task for shepherds, as water is essential for the survival and health of the flock. This act of care reflects the shepherd's responsibility and foreshadows the imagery of God as the Good Shepherd, who provides for His people (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>). The provision of water is also symbolic of spiritual sustenance, as seen in Jesus' invitation to come to Him and drink (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).<p><b>Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well</b><br>Returning the stone ensured the well remained protected and preserved for future use. This action underscores the importance of stewardship and responsibility in managing resources. It also reflects the cyclical nature of life and the need for ongoing diligence in caring for what God has provided. The act of covering the well again can be seen as a reminder of the boundaries and order established by God, as well as the anticipation of future gatherings and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this chapter, Jacob is on a journey to find a wife from his mother's family.

The shepherds waited until every flock had arrived before acting, preventing favoritism and chaos (compare <a href="/genesis/29-8.htm">Genesis 29:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Such communal care echoes earlier scenes: Abraham&#8217;s servant waited &#8220;when the women came out to draw water&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-11.htm">Genesis 24:11</a>), and Moses sat by a well until shepherds and flocks arrived (<a href="/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture anticipates Christ&#8217;s promise that His people will one day be gathered together in unity (<a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep</b><p>&#8226; The stone was large enough to require several men&#8212;underscoring both cooperation and strength.
