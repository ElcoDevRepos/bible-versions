His involvement with Abram highlights the significance of Abram's presence in Egypt. This event occurs after Abram's deception about Sarai being his sister, which led to Pharaoh taking her into his palace. The divine intervention through plagues (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>) prompts Pharaoh to act. This phrase underscores the theme of God's protection over Abram despite his shortcomings. It also foreshadows future interactions between the descendants of Abram and Egypt, notably the Exodus.<p><b>and they sent him away with his wife</b><br>Abram's departure with Sarai intact signifies God's faithfulness in preserving the covenant lineage. Despite Abram's failure to trust fully in God's promise, God ensures Sarai's return to her rightful place. This act of sending away can be seen as a form of divine deliverance, prefiguring later redemptive acts in Scripture. The restoration of Sarai to Abram also maintains the integrity of the promise that through Abram's seed all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and all his possessions</b><br>Abram leaves Egypt not only with his wife but also with increased wealth, as indicated earlier in <a href="/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God's people often leave periods of trial with greater blessings, as seen in the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>). The possessions symbolize God's provision and blessing, despite human error. This also sets a precedent for the wealth and prosperity that would characterize the patriarchs, pointing to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who interacts with Abram.

Though Abram&#8217;s deception placed him in danger, God intervenes to preserve His chosen servant.<p>&#8226; This protection echoes <a href="/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a>, &#8220;Do not touch My anointed ones; do no harm to My prophets,&#8221; and anticipates later instances where the Lord safeguards His people despite their failings (<a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6-7</a> with Abimelech).<p>&#8226; The episode underscores that God&#8217;s faithfulness is anchored in His promise, not Abram&#8217;s performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they sent him away</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sent away&#8221; signals a formal dismissal&#8212;Abram is expelled from Egypt. Yet, the forced exit becomes deliverance, turning potential disaster into forward progress toward Canaan.<p>&#8226; Parallels appear when Moses and Israel are driven out of Egypt centuries later (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>) and when Paul and Barnabas are expelled from Pisidian Antioch (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50-52</a>), each time advancing God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; What seems like rejection often becomes a divine redirection toward promised blessings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with his wife</b><p>&#8226; Sarai is returned unharmed, restoring the marriage bond Abram had jeopardized. God safeguards the lineage through which He will bring forth the Messiah (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar restoration occurs in <a href="/genesis/20-14.htm">Genesis 20:14</a> when Abimelech returns Sarah, and in <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a> husbands are urged to honor their wives &#8220;so that your prayers will not be hindered.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The scene upholds the sanctity of marriage and hints at God&#8217;s larger purpose of preserving the covenant family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his possessions</b><p>&#8226; Abram departs not only intact but enriched (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s gifts, meant to placate, become instruments of blessing, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, &#8220;the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This foreshadows Israel leaving Egypt &#8220;with silver and gold&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37</a>) and Job receiving double after his trial (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>).
