This imagery reinforces the idea of divine protection and guidance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, where angels are commanded to guard God's people.

Day after day, then, he travels forward, anxious and oppressed, feeling as he went farther from his home the responsibilities attendant upon that birthright which he had coveted so eagerly. His lot was now a repetition of that of Abraham; but he had travelled from Haran with a noble following, and by express command. Jacob had at most but a few attendants, and no voice from God had ever as yet reached him. But faith in Him was growing strong, and the Divine ratification to him of the Abrahamic covenant was at length vouchsafed. In his sleep he sees a ladder, or staircase, rising from the ground at his side, and reaching up to heaven. It tells him that heaven and earth are united, and that there is a way from one to the other. Upon these stairs "messengers of Elohim are ascending and descending," carrying up to God men's prayers, and the tale of their wants and sorrows, of their faith and hope and trust; and bringing down to them help and comfort and blessing. At the head of the ladder Jehovah himself stands. The word is that used in <a href="/genesis/24-13.htm" title="Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:">Genesis 24:13</a>, and signifies that the Deity was not there accidentally, but that He holds there His permanent station. Finally, Jehovah from His heavenly post confirms to Jacob all the promises made from the time when Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees, and assures him of His constant presence and protection.<p>It has been pointed out that each of the three stages in the dream has emphasis given to it by the word <span class= "ital">behold, </span>and that this rises to a climax at the third repetition, when the covenant God is seen stationed at the head of this pathway between earth and heaven. But besides this, the value of Jacob in Jehovah's sight arises now from his being the appointed ancestor of the Mesciah, in whom all the families of the earth were to be blessed (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm" title="And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 28:14</a>). Christ, too, is the Way symbolised by this ladder (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>), and the bridge of union between the material and the spiritual world (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1Timothy 2:5</a>). Our Lord, accordingly, Himself claims that "the angels of God ascend and descend upon Him" (<a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>), . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he dreamed</span>. This dream, which has been pronounced "beautifully ingenious," "clever" and "philosophical," the work of a later Hebrew poet and not of Jacob (De Wette), was not wonderful considering the state of mind and body in which he must have been - fatigued by travel, saddened by thoughts of home, doubtless meditating on his mother, and more than likely pondering the great benediction of his aged and, to all appearance, dying father.
