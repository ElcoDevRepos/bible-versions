The context is the story of Joseph, which begins in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>. Joseph's brothers were envious of him because he was their father's favorite, and they plotted against him. This event is pivotal in the narrative of the Israelites, as it sets the stage for the eventual migration of Jacob's family to Egypt. The phrase highlights the loss and separation that Jacob feels, which is a recurring theme in the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>I said: &#8220;Surely he has been torn to pieces.&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's assumption that Joseph was killed by a wild animal is based on the evidence presented to him by his sons, who dipped Joseph's coat in goat's blood to deceive their father (<a href="/genesis/37-31.htm">Genesis 37:31-33</a>). This deception is a significant moment of familial betrayal and reflects the brokenness and sin within Jacob's family. The imagery of being "torn to pieces" evokes a sense of violent death, which is a common fear in the ancient Near East, where wild animals posed a real threat. This phrase also foreshadows the later suffering and trials that Joseph endures, which ultimately lead to his rise to power in Egypt.<p><b>And I have not seen him since.</b><br>Jacob's lamentation over not seeing Joseph again underscores the deep grief and loss he experiences. This absence is not just physical but also emotional and spiritual, as Jacob believes he has lost his beloved son forever. The phrase captures the enduring nature of Jacob's sorrow, which is only resolved later in the narrative when he is reunited with Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29-30</a>). This moment of reunion is a powerful testament to God's providence and the restoration of broken relationships. The theme of separation and eventual reconciliation is a motif that runs throughout the Bible, pointing to the ultimate reconciliation between God and humanity through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, father of Joseph and his brothers.
