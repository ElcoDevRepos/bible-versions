In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, family ties and proper farewells were significant. Laban's question implies a breach of social norms and trust. Jacob's secret departure was motivated by fear of Laban's potential reaction, as Laban had previously shown deceitful behavior (<a href="/genesis/29-25.htm">Genesis 29:25</a>). This echoes earlier biblical themes of deception, such as Jacob's own deception of Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-35.htm">Genesis 27:35</a>). The tension between Laban and Jacob highlights the ongoing struggle between God's chosen people and those who oppose them.<p><b>I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps.</b><br>Laban's claim of a joyful send-off contrasts with his past actions, suggesting insincerity. The mention of "joy and singing, with tambourines and harps" reflects common celebratory practices in ancient times, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>, where Miriam leads the women with tambourines after crossing the Red Sea. These instruments were often used in festive and religious occasions, symbolizing joy and community. Laban's statement may be seen as an attempt to portray himself as benevolent, despite his history of exploiting Jacob (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the eventual joyful return of God's people to their promised inheritance, a theme seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, who fled from his father-in-law Laban's household with his family and possessions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Jacob's father-in-law, who confronts Jacob for leaving secretly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paddan-aram.htm">Paddan-aram</a></b><br>The region where Laban lived and where Jacob had spent many years working for Laban.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fleeing_of_jacob.htm">Fleeing of Jacob</a></b><br>The event where Jacob leaves Laban's household secretly, fearing that Laban would prevent him from leaving with his family and possessions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/confrontation.htm">Confrontation</a></b><br>Laban catches up with Jacob and questions his motives for leaving without notice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_transparency.htm">The Importance of Transparency</a></b><br>Jacob's secret departure highlights the need for honesty and transparency in relationships.

Jacob feared Laban&#8217;s reaction, having served twenty years under shifting terms (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records other moments when God&#8217;s people fled danger in secrecy&#8212;Moses leaving Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14-15</a>) or David escaping Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>).<p>&#8226; These parallels remind us that caution can be wise when confronting potential oppression. Yet Laban sees only betrayal, not his own conduct that drove Jacob to this decision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and deceive me,</b><p>Laban accuses Jacob of trickery, echoing a theme that runs through both men&#8217;s histories.<p>&#8226; Jacob once deceived his own father (<a href="/genesis/27-35.htm">Genesis 27:35</a>), while Laban deceived Jacob by swapping Leah for Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-25.htm">Genesis 29:25</a>).<p>&#8226; This cycle of deceit highlights the biblical principle that &#8220;whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). God&#8217;s Word presents these events as literal history, warning us how deception breeds mistrust and broken fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>without even telling me?</b><p>The lack of communication fuels Laban&#8217;s grievance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5-6</a> notes that open rebuke and faithful wounds are better than concealed love; Jacob&#8217;s silence forfeited a candid farewell.<p>&#8226; Jesus later teaches His followers to address conflicts directly (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>), underscoring the timeless value of honest dialogue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I would have sent you away with joy and singing,</b><p>Laban&#8217;s claim sounds generous, yet the narrative invites healthy skepticism.<p>&#8226; Earlier he pursued Jacob &#8220;for three days&#8221; in hot anger (<a href="/genesis/31-22.htm">Genesis 31:22-23</a>), revealing the true state of his heart.<p>&#8226; Similar parting celebrations appear when Israel crossed the Red Sea and Miriam led in song (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>), or when the prodigal&#8217;s return sparked music and dancing (<a href="/luke/15-23.htm">Luke 15:23-25</a>). Laban couches his hurt pride in the language of festivity, but his track record casts doubt on whether such joy would really have occurred.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with tambourines and harps.</b><p>The mention of instruments paints a vivid, festive picture.<p>&#8226; Tambourines and stringed instruments accompany victory processions in Scripture&#8212;Saul&#8217;s triumph (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>), prophets worshiping before battle (<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>), and the psalmist&#8217;s call to praise God &#8220;with tambourine and dancing&#8230; with harp and lyre&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/150-4.htm">Psalm 150:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Laban invokes this imagery to emphasize the celebration he claims Jacob forfeited, highlighting the cultural importance of music at farewells and covenant events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a> records Laban&#8217;s wounded outcry, framed in five vivid charges: secrecy, deception, silence, missed celebration, and lost music. Taken literally, the verse reveals:<p>&#8226; Jacob acted covertly out of legitimate fear.<p>&#8226; Laban&#8212;himself a deceiver&#8212;feels the sting of deception.<p>&#8226; Honest communication could have altered the dynamic, yet distrust ruled the day.<p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s professed intent of joyful departure rings hollow against his prior exploitation.<p>This single verse therefore exposes the relational fallout of sin and mistrust while underscoring God&#8217;s protective hand over Jacob, the heir of the covenant promise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1444;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did you run away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1428;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;r&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
