They were sent by God to assess the situation in Sodom and to rescue Lot and his family. This encounter highlights the biblical theme of divine intervention and protection for the righteous. The presence of angels in human form is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> when they visit Abraham.<p><b>&#8220;Do you have anyone else here&#8212;</b><br>This question emphasizes the urgency and seriousness of the impending judgment on Sodom. It reflects God's mercy in offering salvation to Lot's family. The inquiry also underscores the importance of family and community in biblical narratives, where salvation often extends to households rather than individuals alone.<p><b>a son-in-law, your sons or daughters,</b><br>The mention of "son-in-law" and "sons or daughters" indicates Lot's extended family. In the cultural context of the time, family ties were crucial, and the well-being of one's family was a primary concern. This reflects the biblical principle of household salvation, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, where the promise of salvation extends to one's household.<p><b>or anyone else in the city who belongs to you?</b><br>This phrase suggests that Lot may have had other relatives or servants in Sodom. It highlights the inclusivity of God's offer of rescue, extending beyond immediate family to all who are associated with Lot. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God's desire for all to be saved, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>.<p><b>Get them out of here,</b><br>The command to "get them out" is a direct and urgent call to action, reflecting the imminent destruction of Sodom. It serves as a warning of divine judgment and a call to repentance and obedience. This echoes the biblical theme of God's deliverance of the righteous from judgment, as seen in the story of Noah and the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>. The urgency also prefigures the call to flee from sin and seek salvation through Christ, as seen in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, living in Sodom.
