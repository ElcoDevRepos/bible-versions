His inability to control his emotions signifies the deep personal conflict and emotional burden he has carried since being sold into slavery by his brothers. This moment is a culmination of years of separation and hidden identity. The tension between his Egyptian identity and his Hebrew roots reaches a breaking point, reflecting the human struggle between forgiveness and justice.<p><b>and he cried out, &#8220;Send everyone away from me!&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's command to send everyone away underscores the private and personal nature of the revelation he is about to make. It also reflects the cultural norms of maintaining dignity and privacy in personal matters, especially those involving family. This act of clearing the room ensures that the moment of reconciliation is intimate and free from the eyes of outsiders, which is significant in a culture that values family honor and privacy.<p><b>So none of them were with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers</b><br>The absence of others during Joseph's revelation to his brothers emphasizes the personal and familial nature of the encounter. This moment of self-disclosure is pivotal, as Joseph reveals his true identity to those who wronged him. It is a powerful act of vulnerability and forgiveness, prefiguring the ultimate reconciliation and redemption themes found throughout Scripture. Joseph's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who reveals Himself to those who have sinned against Him, offering forgiveness and restoration. This private revelation also highlights the theme of God's providence and the fulfillment of His promises, as Joseph's dreams from <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a> are realized in this moment of familial reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers.

Earlier scenes hinted at this growing emotion: &#8220;He turned away from them and wept&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-24.htm">Genesis 42:24</a>); &#8220;he hurried out and wept&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently affirms the rightful place of godly emotion&#8212;&#8220;a time to weep&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a>) and even our Lord &#8220;wept&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>). Joseph&#8217;s tears do not signal weakness but reflect the heart of a man walking in God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before all his attendants</b><p>&#8226; Joseph stands as Egypt&#8217;s governor (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>). Court protocol demanded composure, yet the moment overrides rank.<p>&#8226; Authority is no shield against compassion. Jesus, though Lord, was &#8220;moved with compassion&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>). Like Joseph, true leadership allows godly emotion to surface for the good of others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he cried out, &#8220;Send everyone away from me!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Privacy is urgent: Egyptian officials do not share the family covenant story. Protecting his brothers from humiliation fits <a href="/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, &#8220;Love covers all transgressions.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The loud command echoes the intensity found in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>&#8212;when hearts are full, voices rise. Yet the purpose is gentle: create a safe space for reconciliation (compare <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So none of them were with Joseph</b><p>&#8226; The room clears. Joseph&#8217;s vulnerability is for family alone; strangers cannot mediate this sacred disclosure. Similar moments appear when Peter &#8220;put them all outside&#8221; before raising Tabitha (<a href="/acts/9-40.htm">Acts 9:40</a>) and when Jesus expelled the crowd before Jairus&#8217;s daughter was raised (<a href="/mark/5-40.htm">Mark 5:40</a>).<p>&#8226; God often works most deeply in private settings (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>), teaching that reconciliation usually begins away from the spotlight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he made himself known to his brothers</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew brothers face the Egyptian governor&#8212;then the mask drops. Joseph&#8217;s first words in the next verse, &#8220;I am Joseph,&#8221; fulfill the dreams of <a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7&#8211;10</a> and God&#8217;s larger providential plan.<p>&#8226; This unveiling anticipates Christ: the risen Jesus revealed Himself to His disciples in locked quarters (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>). As Joseph&#8217;s disclosure leads to forgiveness and provision (<a href="/genesis/45-4.htm">Genesis 45:4&#8211;11</a>), Christ&#8217;s revelation offers even greater rescue (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph does not retaliate; instead he welcomes. The literal accuracy of the narrative underscores <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19&#8211;21</a>: God&#8217;s servant overcomes evil with good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase of <a href="/genesis/45-1.htm">Genesis 45:1</a> tracks Joseph&#8217;s emotional crescendo from restraint to revelation. His tears, authority, command for privacy, empty room, and self-disclosure converge to display God&#8217;s providence and heart for reconciliation. The scene assures us that divine plans sometimes require deep emotion, leadership that values compassion, guarded spaces for repentance, and courageous self-revelation that leads to forgiveness&#8212;pointing ultimately to the greater Deliverer who would one day reveal Himself for our salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/45.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XLV.<p>JOSEPH IS RECONCILED TO HIS BRETHREN, AND ENCOURAGES THEM AND HIS FATHER TO MAKE EGYPT THEIR HOME.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Joseph could not refrain himself.</span>--The picture which Judah had drawn of his father's love for Benjamin, the thought that by separating them he might have made his father die of grief, and the sight of his brethren, and especially of Judah offering to endure a life of slavery in order that Benjamin might go free, overpowered Joseph's feelings, and he commanded all his attendants to quit the apartment in order that there might be no restraint upon himself or his brethren when he made known to them that he was the brother whom they had so cruelly years ago condemned to be a slave.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">Joseph could not refrain himself</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> keep himself from giving way to the impulses of love) <span class="cmt_word">before all them that stood by him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Egyptian officials of his household); and he cried (or made proclamation, issued an instruction), <span class="cmt_word">Cause every man to go out from me</span>. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
