Joseph, the eleventh son, was sold into slavery by these brothers, except for Benjamin, the youngest, who stayed with Jacob. The number ten is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or the fullness of human responsibility. The absence of Benjamin highlights Jacob's protective nature over his youngest son, especially after losing Joseph.<p><b>went down</b><br>The phrase "went down" is geographically accurate, as Canaan is situated at a higher elevation compared to Egypt. This descent is not only physical but also symbolic, representing a humbling journey for the brothers who once wronged Joseph. In biblical narratives, "going down" to Egypt often signifies a movement away from the Promised Land, which can imply a spiritual or moral decline.<p><b>to buy grain</b><br>The need to buy grain indicates a severe famine affecting the region, fulfilling Joseph's earlier interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-32</a>). This famine was widespread, affecting not only Egypt but also surrounding areas, including Canaan. The act of buying grain from Egypt underscores Egypt's role as a place of provision and refuge during times of crisis, a recurring theme in the Bible.<p><b>from Egypt</b><br>Egypt, a powerful and advanced civilization, was known for its fertile Nile Delta, which allowed it to store surplus grain. This setting is crucial for the unfolding of God's plan for Israel, as Egypt becomes both a place of refuge and a place of bondage. Theologically, Egypt often represents the world or a place of testing for God's people. Joseph's position in Egypt as a ruler foreshadows Christ's role as a savior, providing sustenance and salvation to those in need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The ten brothers of Joseph, excluding Benjamin, who travel to Egypt to buy grain during a severe famine.
