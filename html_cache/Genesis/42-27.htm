The brothers were returning from Egypt to Canaan, a journey that would have taken several days. Lodging for the night suggests a pause in their travel, a moment of rest and reflection. This setting also foreshadows the revelation and ensuing anxiety that will unfold, as nighttime often symbolizes a time of vulnerability and introspection in biblical narratives.<p><b>one of them opened his sack</b><br>The act of opening the sack is significant as it reveals the hidden truth. In biblical literature, opening or uncovering often symbolizes revelation or the uncovering of hidden realities. This moment is pivotal as it begins to unravel the brothers' understanding of their situation and the mysterious workings of God in their lives. It also sets the stage for the unfolding drama of Joseph's testing of his brothers.<p><b>to get feed for his donkey</b><br>The need to feed the donkey highlights the practical concerns of travel in the ancient world. Donkeys were essential for transportation and carrying goods, underscoring the brothers' dependence on these animals for their journey. This detail adds authenticity to the narrative, grounding it in the everyday realities of life in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack</b><br>The discovery of the silver is a moment of shock and fear for the brothers. Silver was the currency of trade, and its unexpected presence suggests a misunderstanding or a potential accusation of theft. This incident is a test of the brothers' integrity and honesty, echoing Joseph's earlier experiences with his brothers' betrayal. The silver in the sack can also be seen as a type of Christ, symbolizing redemption and the price paid for sin, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.

Nightfall forces them to stop and make camp, just as Jacob did at Bethel when &#8220;he reached a certain place and spent the night there&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows travel pauses as God-appointed moments for reflection or revelation&#8212;think of <a href="/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24</a> or <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10</a>. Here, the pause sets the stage for God to uncover what has been hidden. We can trust the historical accuracy of this detail; it is not filler but part of God&#8217;s precise orchestration (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey</b><p>Travelers in the Ancient Near East had to care for their animals before themselves, much like Eliezer did when he first arrived at Rebekah&#8217;s home (<a href="/genesis/24-32.htm">Genesis 24:32-33</a>). The brother&#8217;s simple act of kindness toward his donkey becomes the trigger for a profound discovery. Small, everyday choices often become divine appointments, as illustrated in <a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a> where Ruth&#8217;s &#8220;chance&#8221; gleaning in Boaz&#8217;s field was guided by God. The text underscores that even routine duties are under the Lord&#8217;s sovereign plan (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He saw his silver in the mouth of the sack</b><p>&#8220;and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack.&#8221; Earlier, Joseph had ordered his servants to &#8220;return each man&#8217;s silver to his sack&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>). Now the brother finds that silver exactly where he paid it, sparking fear and confusion (<a href="/genesis/42-28.htm">Genesis 42:28</a>). The incident foreshadows the fuller revelation in <a href="/genesis/43-23.htm">Genesis 43:23</a>, where Joseph&#8217;s steward says, &#8220;Your God, and the God of your father, has put treasure in your sacks.&#8221; God is showing grace before guilt has been fully confessed&#8212;much like <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> describes His kindness leading to repentance. At the same time, the discovery reminds us of Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>: &#8220;Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed.&#8221; Sin still needs to be dealt with, but grace is already at work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/42-27.htm">Genesis 42:27</a> records a divinely timed discovery in three movements: a night stop, a routine act of feeding a donkey, and the startling sight of returned silver. Each detail is historically true and spiritually purposeful. God uses ordinary moments to expose hidden matters, extend undeserved kindness, and move His redemptive plan forward. The verse invites us to recognize His hand in every stop, task, and surprise along our own journeys.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">In the inn.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">lodging-place, </span>literally, place to pass the night. It is quite possible that on a route frequented by numerous caravans there were places where a certain amount of protection for the beasts of burden and their attendants had been provided, either by the rulers, or by benevolent people. But Joseph's brethren would find there at most only walls and water. "The one" who opened his sack is said by tradition to have been Levi. At the end of the verse this sack is called by another name, signifying a travelling-bag, or wallet for forage. The translation of these three different words, vessel, wallet, and sack, indifferently by the last of them, has led to the absurd view, common among commentators, that Joseph's brethren went down into Egypt, each with one ass and one sack. Hence their astonishment that such an insignificant knot of men should be brought before the governor of Egypt. But the word used in <a href="/genesis/42-25.htm" title="Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.">Genesis 42:25</a> signifies everything into which corn could be put; and the word at the end of this verse is the travelling-bag, which each of the patriarchs carried behind him on his riding ass. Their men would go on foot at the side of the beasts of burden laden with the corn.<p>It is said here that one only found his money at the lodging-place, and that the rest did not find their money until they emptied their sacks on reaching home. the sacks mentioned here (in <a href="/genesis/42-35.htm" title="And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.">Genesis 42:35</a>) were the same as the travelling-bags, for they are expressly so called in <a href="/context/genesis/43-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.">Genesis 43:21-23</a>. In <a href="/genesis/43-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.">Genesis 43:21</a>, however, they tell Joseph's steward that they all found their money in the mouth of their sacks on opening them at the lodging-place. This was not strictly accurate, but it would have been wearisome and useless to enter into such details. Two things it was necessary to show: the first, that all had found their money; the second, that they had gone too far on their journey homewards to be able to return and give the money back. Probably what is said in <a href="/genesis/43-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.">Genesis 43:21</a> was literally true only of one, and he found his money because it had been put in last, and was therefore at the mouth of the wallet. In all the other sacks it had been put in first, under the corn, and so they did not find it until "they had emptied their sacks." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as one of them opened his sack</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and the one opened his sack, i.e.</span> they did not all open their sacks on the homeward journey, although afterwards, in reporting the circumstance to Joseph, they represent themselves as having done so (<a href="/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>); but only one at the wayside inn, and the rest on reaching home (ver. 35; <span class="accented">vide infra</span>, <a href="/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to give his ass provender in the inn</span> (the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, an inn to pass the night, was not in the modern sense of the term, but simply a halting-place or camping station where travelers were wont to lodge, without finding for themselves or animals any other food than they carried with them), <span class="cmt_word">he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth</span> - literally, <span class="accented">in the opening, of his amtachath</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, to spread out, an old word for a sack (<a href="/genesis/43-18.htm">Genesis 43:18, 21, 22</a>), here used synonymously with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, from which it would seem that the travelers carried two sorts of bags, one for the corn <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (ver. 25), and another for the called asses' provender called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>.
