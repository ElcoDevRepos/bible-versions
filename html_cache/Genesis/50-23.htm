Seeing descendants to the third generation signifies a full and blessed life, as longevity was considered a sign of divine favor. Ephraim, Joseph's younger son, was blessed by Jacob to become greater than his older brother Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). This fulfillment of Jacob's blessing is evident as Joseph witnesses Ephraim's lineage prospering. The mention of the third generation also connects to the biblical theme of generational blessings and the continuity of God's promises through family lines.<p><b>and indeed the sons of Machir son of Manasseh</b><br>Machir is the firstborn of Manasseh, Joseph's other son. The mention of Machir's sons indicates the continuation of Joseph's lineage through both of his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Machir's descendants would later become significant in Israel's history, as they settled in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River (<a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39-40</a>). This geographical detail underscores the expansion and establishment of the tribes of Israel in the Promised Land, fulfilling God's covenant with Abraham regarding his descendants.<p><b>were brought up on Joseph&#8217;s knees</b><br>This phrase suggests a close familial relationship and Joseph's active role in the upbringing of his grandchildren. In ancient Near Eastern culture, placing children on one's knees symbolized adoption or acceptance into the family. It reflects Joseph's affection and responsibility towards his descendants, ensuring they are raised in the knowledge of their heritage and faith. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who welcomes believers into the family of God, offering them care and spiritual inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Joseph is one of the twelve sons of Jacob and a key leader in Egypt.
