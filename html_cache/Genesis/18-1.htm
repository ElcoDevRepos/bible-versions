In the Old Testament, such appearances are significant, often marking pivotal moments in God's covenant relationship with His people. The LORD here is understood as Yahweh, the covenant name of God, emphasizing His personal relationship with Abraham. This appearance prefigures the incarnation of Christ, where God would again appear to humanity in a tangible form.<p><b>by the Oaks of Mamre</b><br>The Oaks of Mamre, also known as the terebinths of Mamre, were located near Hebron in the land of Canaan. This site is significant as it was a place where Abraham had previously built an altar to the LORD (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). The location is associated with divine encounters and promises, reinforcing the sacredness of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. Archaeological evidence suggests that this area was a significant settlement during the time of the patriarchs.<p><b>in the heat of the day</b><br>The mention of the heat of the day suggests a time of rest and inactivity, typical in the ancient Near East due to the intense midday sun. This detail highlights the unexpected nature of the divine visitation, as it occurs during a time when Abraham would not typically expect visitors. It underscores the idea that God&#8217;s interventions in human affairs often come at unexpected times.<p><b>while he was sitting at the entrance of his tent</b><br>Abraham's position at the entrance of his tent indicates a posture of readiness and hospitality, common in nomadic cultures. The tent symbolizes a temporary dwelling, reflecting Abraham's status as a sojourner in the land. This setting foreshadows the hospitality Abraham will extend to his visitors, a key theme in the subsequent narrative. The tent also serves as a metaphor for the tabernacle, where God would later dwell among His people, pointing forward to the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The passage begins with the LORD appearing to Abraham.

We thus find a Jehovistic section coupled in the closest way with one which is Elohistic (comp. <a href="/context/genesis/17-22.htm" title="And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.">Genesis 17:22-23</a>); and even here it is Elohim who for Abraham's sake delivers Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.">Genesis 19:29</a>). Far more important, however, is it to notice that this familiar intercourse, and clear revelation of Jehovah to Abraham, follows upon his closer relation to God by virtue of the sacrament of circumcision. Jewish tradition adds that this visit was made to Abraham on the third day after the rite had been performed, and was for the purpose of healing him from the painful consequences of it. It was on this account, as they think, that Abraham was resting at home, instead of being with his herds in the field.<p><span class= "bld">The plains (Heb., <span class= "ital">the oaks</span>)</span> <span class= "bld">of Mamre.</span>--(See <a href="/genesis/13-18.htm" title="Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm" title="And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.">Genesis 14:13</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> - <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the Divine name employed throughout the present and succeeding chapters, which are accordingly assigned to the Jehovist (Tuch, Bleek, Davidson, Colenso), with the exception of <a href="/genesis/19-29.htm">Genesis 19:29</a>, which is commonly regarded as a fragment of the original Elohist's narration (vide <span class="accented">infra</span>) <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>appeared unto him</span>.
