The people had exhausted their money and livestock to buy grain, and as a last resort, they offered themselves and their land to Pharaoh in exchange for food. This servitude was a form of indentured servitude rather than slavery, as the people retained some rights and were able to work the land. Joseph's management of the crisis reflects his wisdom and administrative skills, which were recognized by Pharaoh. This event also foreshadows the later enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, as seen in <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>, highlighting the cyclical nature of servitude and liberation in biblical history.<p><b>from one end of Egypt to the other</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the widespread impact of the famine and Joseph's policies across the entire nation of Egypt. Geographically, Egypt was a significant and powerful kingdom, stretching from the Nile Delta in the north to the cataracts of the Nile in the south. The phrase indicates that Joseph's actions affected all regions, demonstrating the centralization of power under Pharaoh's rule. Historically, Egypt was known for its agricultural wealth, primarily due to the Nile River, which made the famine particularly devastating. This centralization and control over resources can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides sustenance and salvation to all who come to Him, as seen in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the bread of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who rose to power in Egypt.

They willingly approach Joseph, asking, &#8220;Buy us and our land in exchange for food.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s action is therefore a negotiated outcome, not a violent conquest. The verb &#8220;reduced&#8221; conveys an administrative reordering under Pharaoh&#8217;s centralized control.<p>&#8226; Similar large-scale reorganization appears with Solomon&#8217;s districts (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7-19</a>), showing that Scripture views strong administration as a means of stability in crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To servitude</b><p>&#8226; The servitude described is a form of state tenancy:<p>&#8211; The land now belongs to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/47-20.htm">Genesis 47:20-22</a>).<p>&#8211; People become royal tenants, receiving seed and security.<p>&#8211; They agree to give one-fifth of all future harvests to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/47-23.htm">Genesis 47:23-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike harsh bondage later inflicted on Israel (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>), this arrangement preserves life, property, and community while acknowledging Pharaoh&#8217;s sovereignty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> reminds believers that governmental authority can be a God-ordained instrument for societal order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From one end of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the breadth of Joseph&#8217;s plan&#8212;no province is overlooked.<p>&#8226; Such national scope echoes the earlier prophecy that seven years of famine would &#8220;ravage the land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-30.htm">Genesis 41:30</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a> speaks of Egypt&#8217;s rulers holding absolute sway; Joseph&#8217;s policy anticipates that centralized model, yet with benevolent intent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the other</b><p>&#8226; Total coverage ensures food distribution is uniform, preventing regional favoritism.<p>&#8226; By bringing the entire nation under one statute, Joseph lays groundwork for future stability; even centuries later, Egyptians remember centralized grain storage (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a> suggests the continuity of store-cities).<p>&#8226; The comprehensiveness mirrors God&#8217;s own sovereign reach, &#8220;His kingdom rules over all&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-21.htm">Genesis 47:21</a> records Joseph&#8217;s life-preserving strategy during Egypt&#8217;s worst famine. Acting under divine wisdom and Pharaoh&#8217;s authority, he reorganizes land and labor so every Egyptian becomes a tenant of the crown, obligated to a fair 20 percent tax but guaranteed seed and sustenance. The phrase &#8220;from one end of Egypt to the other&#8221; underscores the national scope of this mercy-mingled mandate. Far from arbitrary oppression, the servitude is a pragmatic, centralized system that saves lives, maintains social order, and fulfills God&#8217;s larger plan to position Israel in Egypt until the appointed time of Exodus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">He removed them to cities.</span>--Joseph's object in this measure was most merciful. As the corn was stored up in the cities, the people would be sure of nourishment only if they were in the immediate neighbourhood of the food. As a consequence, possibly, of Joseph's policy, the number of cities in the Valley of the Nile became so enormous that Herodotus computes them at 20,000. Thus the people would not dwell at any distance from their lands, while it would be impossible for them to reside actually on their plots of ground, as these every year are overflowed by the Nile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as for the people, he removed them</span> - not enslaved them, converted them into serfs and bondmen to Pharaoh (LXX., Vulgate), but simply transferred them, caused them to pass over - <span class="cmt_word">to cities</span> - not from cities to cities, as if changing their populations (Onkelos, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch), but either from the country districts to the towns (Targums Jonathan and Jerusalem, Lange, Schumann, Gerlach, Murphy), or according to the cities, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in which the grain had been previously collected (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.</span> Not that the people were transported from one side of the country to the other as a high stroke of policy to complete their subjugation (Jarchi, Grotius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, and others), but that throughout the land they were moved into the nearest cities, as a considerate and even merciful arrangement for the more efficiently supplying them with food (Calvin, Keil, Lange, Wordsworth, Speaker's Commentary). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/47-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and Joseph reduced</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1489;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;&#7687;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
