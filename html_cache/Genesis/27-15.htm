The "finest clothes" likely refer to garments reserved for special occasions, possibly indicating Esau's status as the firstborn. In ancient Near Eastern culture, clothing often symbolized identity and status. Rebekah's choice to use these specific garments underscores the gravity of her deception. This act of taking Esau's clothes is a physical manifestation of the transfer of blessing and birthright, which Jacob had previously acquired through Esau's impulsive decision (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>).<p><b>that belonged to her older son Esau,</b><br>Esau, as the firstborn, held a special place in the family hierarchy, which included the birthright and the blessing from his father, Isaac. The birthright was not just a double portion of the inheritance but also carried spiritual significance, including leadership of the family and the covenantal promises given to Abraham. The mention of Esau as the "older son" highlights the tension between the brothers and the subversion of the expected order, a recurring theme in biblical narratives (e.g., Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac).<p><b>and she put them on her younger son Jacob.</b><br>Rebekah's decision to dress Jacob in Esau's clothes is a deliberate act of deception aimed at securing Isaac's blessing for Jacob. This act is laden with irony and foreshadows the future deception Jacob himself will face with Laban. The younger son receiving the blessing over the older is a motif seen throughout Scripture, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the theme that His purposes often defy human expectations (e.g., Joseph over his brothers, David over his brothers). Jacob's name, meaning "supplanter" or "heel-grabber," is fitting in this context, as he is literally taking Esau's place. This event also prefigures the concept of substitutionary atonement, where one takes the place of another, a theme ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

That the clothes mentioned as belonging to Esau were sacerdotal robes possessed by him as heir of the patriarchal priesthood (Jewish Rabbis), though regarded by many as a probable conjecture (Ainsworth, Bush, Candlish, Clarke, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis), is devoid of proof, and may be pronounced unlikely, since the firstborn did not serve in the priesthood while his father lived (Willet, Alford). They were probably festive garments of the princely hunter (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">which were with her in the house,</span> - not because Esau saw that his wives were displeasing to his parents (Mercerus, Willet), or because they were sacred garments (Ainsworth, Poole), but probably because Esau, though married, had not yet quitted the patriarchal household (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and put them upon Jacob her younger son.</span> The verb, being in the hiphil, conveys the sense of causing Jacob to clothe himself, which entirely removes the impression that Jacob was a purely involuntary agent in this deceitful and deeply dishonorable affair. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Rebekah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1440;&#1489;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ri&#7687;&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7259.htm">Strong's 7259: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rebekah -- wife of Isaac</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
