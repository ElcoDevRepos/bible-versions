The term "mighty hunter" suggests not only physical prowess but also a position of leadership and influence. In ancient cultures, hunting was often associated with strength and skill, qualities desirable in a leader. The phrase "before the LORD" indicates that Nimrod's actions were notable in the sight of God, suggesting either divine approval or significant impact. The Hebrew word for "before" can imply presence or prominence, indicating that Nimrod's reputation was well-known. This phrase may also imply that Nimrod's hunting was not just for game but could symbolize his ability to conquer and control, possibly extending to human conquests.<p><b>so it is said,</b><br>This part of the verse indicates that Nimrod's reputation was widespread and became proverbial. The phrase suggests that his exploits were well-known and talked about among the people of that time. It implies that Nimrod's legacy was significant enough to be remembered and referenced by subsequent generations. This oral tradition highlights the importance of storytelling in ancient cultures for preserving history and values.<p><b>&#8220;Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of the phrase emphasizes Nimrod's legendary status. It suggests that his abilities and achievements set a standard for others. The comparison "Like Nimrod" indicates that his prowess was unmatched, making him a benchmark for strength and leadership. This phrase also underscores the idea that Nimrod's influence extended beyond his lifetime, becoming a symbol of might and power. In biblical context, Nimrod is associated with the founding of several ancient cities, including Babel, which later becomes significant in the narrative of the Tower of Babel. This connection to Babel hints at themes of human ambition and defiance against God, which are explored further in Genesis. Nimrod's legacy can be seen as a precursor to later figures who challenge divine authority, drawing a parallel to the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus Christ, who embodies true leadership and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nimrod.htm">Nimrod</a></b><br>A descendant of Ham, son of Cush, and a prominent figure in <a href="/bsb/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>.

The surrounding context of Nimrod&#8217;s kingdom-building (<a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>) leans toward defiance, showing that skill alone does not equal godliness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So it is said</b><p>&#8226; Scripture notes a proverb forming around Nimrod&#8217;s reputation&#8212;his deeds became legendary.<p>&#8226; Similar formulas appear in <a href="/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a>, where memorable events birthed sayings that shaped cultural memory.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word preserves such sayings to teach later generations discernment regarding whom we admire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like Nimrod</b><p>&#8226; By the time Moses wrote Genesis, Nimrod&#8217;s name already symbolized might. <a href="/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a> still uses &#8220;the land of Nimrod&#8221; centuries later.<p>&#8226; The comparison works both ways: it recognizes genuine ability yet subtly warns that fame does not equal favor with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A mighty hunter before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Repeating the full description underlines its importance.

Probably from single combats with fierce animals, Nimrod, now recognised as a public benefactor, was led to organise hunts upon a large scale, and so, like Romulus, became the chief of a band of the most spirited and vigorous shepherds.
