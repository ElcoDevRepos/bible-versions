The Hebrew term used here can imply a specific time for offering, possibly hinting at an established practice or tradition of worship. This sets the stage for understanding the regularity and expectation of offerings to God, which becomes more formalized in later biblical texts.<p><b>Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil</b><br>Cain, as a farmer, brings an offering from his produce. This reflects the agrarian lifestyle of early human societies and highlights the division of labor between Cain and Abel, with Abel being a shepherd. The act of bringing an offering indicates an acknowledgment of God's provision and a desire to worship. However, the text does not specify the quality or quantity of Cain's offering, which becomes significant in understanding the subsequent narrative.<p><b>as an offering to the LORD</b><br>The concept of offering to the LORD is central to worship throughout the Bible. Offerings are acts of devotion, gratitude, and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. In the context of Genesis, this is one of the earliest recorded acts of worship, setting a precedent for sacrificial offerings seen throughout the Old Testament. The LORD, referred to by the covenant name Yahweh, emphasizes a personal relationship with God. This act of offering foreshadows the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law and ultimately points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and perfects the concept of offering through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, a farmer who worked the soil.

Scripture consistently teaches that timing, motive, quality, and the God-ward focus of our offerings all matter. Cain&#8217;s story challenges us to bring our first and finest, in faith, to the LORD who alone is worthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">In process of time.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">at the end of days: </span>not at the end of a week, or a year, or of harvest-time, but of a long indefinite period, shown by the age of Adam at the birth of Seth to have been something less than 130 years.<p><span class= "bld">An offering.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a thank-offering, a present. </span>We must be careful not to introduce here any of the later Levitical ideas about sacrifice. All that we know about this offering is that it was an act of worship, and apparently something usual. Now, each brought of his own produce, and one was accepted and one rejected. Why? Much ingenuity has been wasted on this question, as though Cain erred on technical grounds; whereas we are expressly told in <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a> that Abel's was the more excellent sacrifice, because offered "in faith." It was the state of their hearts that made the difference; though, as the result of unbelief, Cain's may have been a scanty present of common produce, and not of first-fruits, while Abel brought "firstlings, and of the fat thereof," the choicest portion. Abel may also have shown a deeper faith in the promised Deliverer by offering an animal sacrifice: and certainly the acceptance of his sacrifice quickened among men the belief that the proper way of approaching God was by the death of a victim. But Cain's unbloody sacrifice had also a great future before it. It became the <span class= "ital">minchah </span>of the Levitical law, and under the Christian dispensation is the offering of prayer and praise, and especially the Eucharistic thanksgiving. We have already noticed that Abel's sacrifice shows that flesh was probably eaten on solemn occasions. Had animals been killed only for their skins for clothing, repulsive ideas would have been connected with the carcases cast aside to decay; nor would Abel have attached any value to firstlings. But as soon as the rich abundance of Paradise was over, man would quickly learn to eke out the scanty produce of the soil by killing wild animals and the young of his own flocks.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord had respect.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">looked upon, </span>showed that He had seen it. It has been supposed that some visible sign of God's favour was given, and the current idea among the fathers was that fire fell from heaven, and consumed the sacrifice. (Comp. <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm" title="And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.">Leviticus 9:24</a>.) But there is real irreverence in thus filling up the narrative; and it is enough to know that the brothers were aware that God was pleased with the one and displeased with the other. More important is it to notice, first, that God's familiar presence was not withdrawn from man after the fall. He talked with Cain as kindly as with Adam of old. And secondly, in these, the earliest, records of mankind religion is built upon love, and the Deity appears as man's personal friend. This negatives the scientific theory that religion grew out of dim fears and terror at natural phenomena, ending gradually in the evolution of the idea of a destructive and dangerous power outside of man, which man must propitiate as best he could.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in process of time</span>.
