At 130 years old, Jacob's lifespan is significant, yet it is shorter compared to his ancestors. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of pilgrimage, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>, where the patriarchs are described as "strangers and exiles on the earth."<p><b>Jacob replied.</b><br>This interaction occurs during Jacob's audience with Pharaoh in Egypt, a pivotal moment in the narrative of Joseph. Jacob's response is humble and reflective, contrasting with the grandeur of Pharaoh's court. It demonstrates the patriarch's awareness of his place in God's unfolding plan, despite his personal hardships.<p><b>My years have been few and hard,</b><br>Jacob's life was marked by struggle and adversity, including conflicts with Esau, Laban's deception, and the loss of Joseph. This acknowledgment of hardship aligns with the biblical understanding of life as a "vapor" (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>) and the trials faced by God's people. It also reflects the human condition post-Fall, where life is often fraught with difficulty.<p><b>and they have not matched the years of the travels of my fathers.</b><br>Jacob compares his lifespan to that of his forefathers, Abraham and Isaac, who lived 175 and 180 years, respectively. This comparison highlights the decline in human longevity post-Flood, as recorded in Genesis. It also emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant through generations, despite the brevity and challenges of life. Jacob's acknowledgment of his fathers' longer lives serves as a reminder of the enduring faithfulness of God across generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham.

The idea of a pilgrimage is a modern one. Even in <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a> "pilgrim" means in the Greek a stranger who has settled in a country of which he is not a native. So, too, here Jacob was not a pilgrim, for he was no traveller bound for religious motives to some distant shrine, but he was a sojourner, because Canaan was not the native land of his race.<p><span class= "bld">Few and evil.</span>--Evil certainly: for from the time when he deceived his father, Jacob's life had been one of great anxiety and care, in addition to his many sorrows. If he had gained wealth in Haran, it had been by great industry and personal toil, aggravated by Laban's injustice. On his return, there was the double terror of Laban's pursuit behind and Esau's menacing attitude in front. He had then long lain ill at Succoth, waiting till time healed his sprained hip. His entry into the promised land had been made miserable by his daughter's dishonour and the fierce conduct of his sons. And when his home was in sight, he had lost his beloved Rachel; and finally, been compelled to remain at a distance from his father, because Esau was there chief and paramount. His father dies, and Esau goes away; but the ten years between Isaac's death and the descent into Egypt had been years of mourning for Joseph's loss. All these troubles had fallen upon him, and made his days evil; but they were few only in comparison with those of his father and grandfather. In Pharaoh's eyes Jacob had lived beyond the usual span of human existence; but to himself he seemed prematurely old. His end came after seventeen years of peaceful decay spent under Joseph's loving care.<p><span class= "bld">The land of Rameses.</span>--See Note on <a href="/genesis/45-10.htm" title="And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you, and your children, and your children's children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:">Genesis 45:10</a>. Though the LXX. take "land of Rameses" as equivalent to Goshen, it was more probably some special district of it, for, as we have seen, Goshen was a territory of vast extent. Raamses (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm" title="Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.">Exodus 1:11</a>) is the same word, though the Masorites have given it different vowels; but whether such a town already existed, or whether when built it took its name from the district, we cannot tell. If there were such a place, it would at this period be a poor village, consisting of a few shepherds' huts; but long afterwards, in the days of King Rameses II., "it was the centre of a rich, fertile, and beautiful land, described as the abode of happiness, where all alike, rich and poor, lived in peace and plenty."--Canon Cook, <span class= "ital">Excursus on Egyptian Words, </span>p. 487.
