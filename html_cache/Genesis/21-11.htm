This moment reflects the human struggle between personal desires and divine will. Abraham's distress is not only personal but also spiritual, as he grapples with God's promises and the unfolding of His plan. The Hebrew word for "distressed" conveys a sense of deep emotional turmoil, indicating the gravity of the situation for Abraham. This moment is pivotal in Abraham's journey of faith, as he must trust God's plan despite his personal feelings.<p><b>because it concerned his son Ishmael.</b><br>Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar, represents a significant part of Abraham's life and legacy. In the cultural context of the time, the firstborn son held a place of honor and expectation. Ishmael's presence in Abraham's life was a result of Sarah's initial barrenness and the subsequent decision to have a child through Hagar, Sarah's maidservant. This decision, while culturally acceptable, was not in line with God's promise to give Abraham a son through Sarah. The situation with Ishmael also foreshadows the future tensions between the descendants of Ishmael and Isaac, which are seen throughout biblical history. Ishmael's role in the narrative serves as a reminder of the complexities of human decisions and their long-term implications in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

We have just read that Sarah saw Ishmael &#8220;mocking&#8221; Isaac at the weaning feast (<a href="/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Sarah demanded that Abraham &#8220;drive out this slave woman and her son&#8221; so Isaac would be the sole heir.<p>&#8226; Paul later cites this incident to illustrate the contrast between flesh and promise (<a href="/galatians/4-28.htm">Galatians 4:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing is intentional: God had kept His word to give Abraham a son by Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>), and now the family must be ordered in line with that promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This matter</b><p>The &#8220;matter&#8221; is Sarah&#8217;s insistence that Hagar and Ishmael be sent away.<p>&#8226; It is not a minor domestic squabble; it touches covenant inheritance (<a href="/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4-5</a>; 17:19-21).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Abraham had reluctantly accepted Sarah&#8217;s plan to have a child through Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1-4</a>). That shortcut is now exposed as incompatible with God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; God had already signaled that Isaac alone would carry the covenant line (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>), so the &#8220;matter&#8221; is ultimately about aligning with God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Distressed Abraham greatly</b><p>Abraham&#8217;s reaction is deep, personal anguish.<p>&#8226; The wording shows more than annoyance; it is heavy grief, the same verb used when Jacob thought Joseph was dead (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham is a man of faith, yet he feels the full weight of fatherhood (compare <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1-2</a>, where God later tests him with Isaac).<p>&#8226; Even great believers wrestle with God&#8217;s directives when they cut across natural affection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because it concerned his son Ishmael</b><p>The text makes the reason explicit: Ishmael is Abraham&#8217;s son.<p>&#8226; God had blessed Ishmael and promised to make him a great nation (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>); Abraham loves him.<p>&#8226; The command to send Ishmael away seems, on the surface, to conflict with God&#8217;s earlier blessing, intensifying Abraham&#8217;s turmoil.<p>&#8226; Nevertheless, God reassures Abraham in the next verse, instructing him to listen to Sarah and rest in divine provision for Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode illustrates how God can call His people to hard obedience while simultaneously safeguarding those affected (see also <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11</a> highlights the tension between God&#8217;s covenant purposes and human emotion. Abraham is grieved because the issue touches his beloved son, yet the unfolding story shows that obeying God&#8217;s directive&#8212;painful as it is&#8212;will not deprive Ishmael of blessing. The verse invites us to trust that God&#8217;s plans, though sometimes wrenching, perfectly balance justice, mercy, and faithfulness to every promise He has made.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the word </span>(or matter) <span class= "ital">was evil exceedingly in Abraham's eyes. </span>It was not merely painful to him because of his natural affection for Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/17-18.htm" title="And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before you!">Genesis 17:18</a>), but he also thought the proposal unjust.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And the thing</span> (literally, the word, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Sarah's proposal) <span class="cmt_word">was very grievous</span> (literally, <span class="accented">evil exceedingly</span>;
