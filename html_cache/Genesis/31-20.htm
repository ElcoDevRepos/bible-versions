This act of deception is part of a larger narrative of conflict and mistrust that began when Jacob first arrived in Paddan Aram. Laban, identified as an Aramean, connects him to the broader region of Aram, which is significant in the ancestral narratives of the patriarchs. The Arameans were a Semitic people, and Laban's identification as such emphasizes the cultural and familial ties between him and Jacob. This deception can be seen as a continuation of Jacob's earlier life, where deceit played a role in obtaining his brother Esau's birthright and blessing (Genesis 27).<p><b>by not telling him that he was running away</b><br>Jacob's decision to leave without informing Laban reflects his fear of confrontation and possible retribution. This action is reminiscent of his earlier flight from Esau, suggesting a pattern in Jacob's life of fleeing difficult situations. The cultural context of the time would have placed significant importance on family ties and obligations, making Jacob's secretive departure a serious breach of social norms. This act of running away without notice can be seen as a lack of trust in God's protection, despite God's promise to be with him (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>). Jacob's journey back to Canaan is also a fulfillment of God's command to return to the land of his fathers (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>), indicating a divine purpose behind his actions, even if the method was flawed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

Earlier he had learned that Laban&#8217;s attitude toward him had &#8220;changed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-2.htm">Genesis 31:2</a>), and the LORD had told him, &#8220;Return to the land of your fathers&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never hides the failings of God&#8217;s people. Jacob&#8217;s strategy echoes his earlier dealings with Esau (<a href="/bsb/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>). While God&#8217;s promise stands firm (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>), Jacob&#8217;s imperfect methods still have consequences, just as Abraham&#8217;s half-truth in Egypt did (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the narrative shows the LORD working through flawed people to accomplish His covenant purposes, much like <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> affirms for believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Laban the Aramean</b><p>&#8226; Laban, descended from Nahor, represents the world outside the covenant line. His identification as &#8220;the Aramean&#8221; highlights both his ethnicity (<a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>) and his perpetual outsider status compared with Israel, similar to how Pharaoh is labeled &#8220;the Egyptian&#8221; in <a href="/bsb/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1</a>.<p>&#8226; Throughout chapters 29-31, Laban repeatedly exploits Jacob&#8217;s labor (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>). Jacob&#8217;s flight thus exposes Laban&#8217;s unjust treatment, paralleling later Israel&#8217;s exodus from an oppressive foreign host (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over international relationships is in view; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us the LORD directs even the heart of a king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By not telling him</b><p>&#8226; Silence becomes Jacob&#8217;s chosen tactic. Rather than confronting Laban, he departs &#8220;while Laban was away shearing his sheep&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The text contrasts communication styles: Jacob withheld truth, whereas God will soon confront Laban directly in a dream (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture underscores that hidden actions breed suspicion and conflict. Jesus later teaches open reconciliation in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, a principle violated here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That he was running away</b><p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s departure is more than a family dispute; it is a turning point in salvation history. His escape from Paddan-aram sets in motion the return to Canaan, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;running away&#8221; captures urgency. Like Israel&#8217;s later flight from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-33.htm">Exodus 12:33-39</a>), Jacob leaves with wives, children, and possessions&#8212;proof of God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/genesis/31-17.htm">Genesis 31:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s protective oversight is evident: He warns Laban, &#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), echoing <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14-15</a> where God rebukes kings for Israel&#8217;s sake.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a> shows Jacob acting in secrecy to secure his God-directed return to Canaan. His deception spotlights human weakness, while Laban&#8217;s Aramean identity frames the tension between God&#8217;s chosen family and the surrounding nations. Although Jacob avoids confrontation, the LORD remains sovereign, protecting His covenant bearer and steadily advancing the redemptive plan promised to Abraham.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Jacob stole away unawares.</span>--<span class= "ital">Heb., stole the heart. </span>But the heart was regarded by the Hebrews as the seat of the intellect, and so <span class= "ital">to steal a man's understanding, </span>like the similar phrase in Greek, means to elude his observation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">stole the heart of Laban the Syrian</span>, he deceived his mind and intelligence, like <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Horn., ' II.,' 14. 227 (el. vers. 26, 27); hence - <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> (LXX.); so Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Gesenius, and others.
