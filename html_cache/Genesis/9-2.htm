Before the Flood, there was a harmonious coexistence, but now animals would instinctively fear humans. This change can be seen as a protective measure for both humans and animals, ensuring the survival of both. The fear and dread serve as a divine mandate, establishing human dominion over animals, echoing <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> where God commands humanity to subdue the earth. This dominion is not to be tyrannical but responsible stewardship.<p><b>every bird of the air</b><br>Birds, often seen as symbols of freedom and transcendence, are included in this divine decree. The mention of birds highlights the comprehensive nature of human dominion. In biblical symbolism, birds can represent spiritual truths, as seen in the parables of Jesus (e.g., <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>). The inclusion of birds emphasizes that all creatures, regardless of their domain, are under human authority.<p><b>every creature that crawls on the ground</b><br>This phrase encompasses all terrestrial animals, including those that might be considered insignificant or unclean according to later Mosaic Law. The mention of crawling creatures can be seen as a reminder of the curse on the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>, reinforcing the idea of human authority over even the most humble of creatures. It also foreshadows the dietary laws given to Israel, where distinctions between clean and unclean animals are made.<p><b>and all the fish of the sea</b><br>The inclusion of fish signifies the totality of human dominion, extending even to the depths of the oceans. This phrase connects to the creation narrative where God fills the waters with living creatures (<a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-22</a>). The sea, often a symbol of chaos and mystery in ancient Near Eastern cultures, is also subject to human authority, reflecting God's order over creation.<p><b>They are delivered into your hand</b><br>This final phrase signifies a transfer of authority and responsibility. The term "delivered" suggests a divine act of entrusting, similar to how God delivered the Promised Land into the hands of the Israelites (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-3</a>). It implies stewardship and accountability, as humans are to care for creation as God's representatives. This phrase also prefigures the ultimate authority of Jesus Christ, who has all things placed under His feet (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>), highlighting the typology of Christ as the second Adam who restores and fulfills God's original intent for creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The recipient of God's covenant and the one through whom God reestablishes His order on earth after the flood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine speaker who establishes a new covenant with Noah and his descendants, granting them dominion over the earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>All animals, birds, and fish that are subject to human dominion as part of God's covenant with Noah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The renewed creation post-flood, where God reaffirms human dominion over all living creatures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flood.htm">The Flood</a></b><br>The preceding event that led to the destruction of all life except for those preserved in the ark, setting the stage for God's covenant with Noah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dominion_and_stewardship.htm">Dominion and Stewardship</a></b><br>God grants humans dominion over creation, which comes with the responsibility to steward it wisely and compassionately.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_dread.htm">Fear and Dread</a></b><br>The fear and dread of humans placed upon animals signify a change in the relationship post-flood, highlighting the impact of sin on creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's covenant with Noah is a reminder of His faithfulness and the continuity of His promises despite human failure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_responsibility.htm">Human Responsibility</a></b><br>As recipients of God's covenant, humans are called to reflect God's character in their interactions with creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/creation's_groaning.htm">Creation's Groaning</a></b><br>The current state of creation reflects the consequences of sin, pointing believers to the hope of ultimate restoration through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_9_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 9:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_9_2_God_s_rule_human_duty.htm">How does Genesis 9:2 demonstrate God's authority over creation and human responsibility?
