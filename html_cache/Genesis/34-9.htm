In the ancient Near Eastern context, intermarriage was often a means of forming alliances and ensuring peace between different tribes or groups. However, for the Israelites, intermarriage with the Canaanites was discouraged due to the potential for leading them away from their covenant relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This proposal can be seen as a test of the Israelites' commitment to their distinct identity and covenant obligations.<p><b>give us your daughters</b><br>The request to give daughters in marriage highlights the cultural practice of arranged marriages, which were common in biblical times. Daughters were often given in marriage to strengthen familial ties and alliances. This request also underscores the patriarchal nature of the society, where family heads made decisions regarding marriages. The giving of daughters to the Canaanites would have been seen as compromising the purity and distinctiveness of the Israelite lineage, which was meant to be set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>and take our daughters for yourselves.</b><br>This part of the proposal suggests a reciprocal arrangement, where the Israelites would also take Canaanite women as wives. Such intermarriage could lead to the assimilation of Israel into Canaanite culture and religious practices, which was contrary to God's command for Israel to remain separate and holy (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). The potential for idolatry and syncretism was a significant concern, as seen in later biblical narratives where intermarriage led to spiritual decline (e.g., Solomon's marriages in <a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ongoing struggle for Israel to maintain its identity amidst surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A city in the land of Canaan, significant in biblical history as a place of both covenant and conflict.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince, who proposes intermarriage between his people and Jacob's family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, whose family is involved in the events of <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>Jacob's daughter, whose defilement by Shechem sets off the events of this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hivites.htm">The Hivites</a></b><br>A Canaanite people living in the region, represented by Hamor and Shechem in this account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_compromise.htm">The Dangers of Compromise</a></b><br>The proposal for intermarriage represents a temptation to compromise the distinctiveness of God's people.

Scripture consistently treats intermarriage with idol-worshipers as spiritual compromise that invites judgment. Hamor&#8217;s offer, therefore, is not merely social&#8212;it challenges the line through which God plans to bless the world. The verse reminds believers in every age to guard their allegiance to the Lord, even when cultural partnerships promise short-term comfort or gain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Intermarry with us;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7791;&#183;&#7717;at&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hitpael - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2859.htm">Strong's 2859: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, away in marriage, to contract affinity by marriage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">give</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(tit&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">us</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">your daughters,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(tiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our daughters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for yourselves.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/34-9.htm">Genesis 34:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/34-9.htm">OT Law: Genesis 34:9 Make marriages with us (Gen.
