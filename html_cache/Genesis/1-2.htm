The Hebrew words "tohu" (formless) and "bohu" (void) suggest a lack of order and emptiness. This condition sets the stage for God's creative work, emphasizing His power to bring order and life. The concept of chaos is common in ancient Near Eastern creation myths, but the biblical narrative uniquely presents God as sovereign over chaos, not battling it. This pre-creation state can be seen as a type of spiritual barrenness, which God transforms, paralleling how He brings life to spiritually barren hearts.<p><b>and darkness was over the surface of the deep</b><br>Darkness here symbolizes the absence of God's creative light and order. The "deep" (Hebrew "tehom") refers to the primordial waters, a common motif in ancient creation stories, representing chaos and mystery. In biblical theology, darkness often symbolizes evil or judgment, but here it simply indicates the absence of light. This sets the stage for God&#8217;s first act of creation: bringing light. The imagery of darkness and deep is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6-9</a>, which speaks of God's control over the waters, and in the New Testament, where Jesus is the light overcoming darkness (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<p><b>And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters</b><br>The "Spirit of God" (Hebrew "Ruach Elohim") is depicted as active and life-giving, preparing to bring order and life. The verb "hovering" suggests a protective and nurturing presence, similar to a bird over its nest, indicating God's intimate involvement in creation. This anticipates the role of the Holy Spirit throughout scripture as the agent of life and renewal, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a> and <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5-8</a>.

In the Babylonian legend, Tiamat, the Hebrew <span class= "ital">t?hom</span>, is represented as overcome by Merodach, who out of the primaeval anarchy brings order and beauty (Sayce, <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis</span>, pp. 59, 109, 113). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the earth</span>. Clearly the earth referred to in the preceding verse, the present terrestrial globe with its atmospheric firmament, and not simply "the land" as opposed to "the skies" (Murphy); certainly not "the heavens" of ver. 1 as well as the earth (Delitzsch); and least of all "a section of the dry land in Central Asia" (Buckland, Pye Smith). It is a sound principle of exegesis that a word shall retain the meaning it at first possesses till either intimation is made by the writer of a change in its significance, or such change is imperatively demanded by the necessities of the context, neither of which is the case here. <span class="cmt_word">Was.</span> Not "had become." <span class="cmt_word">Without form and void</span>. Literally, wasteness and emptiness, <span class="accented">tohu vabohu</span>. The words are employed in <a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a> to depict the desolation and desertion of a ruined and depopulated land, and by many have been pressed into service to support the idea of a preceding cosmos, of which the chaotic condition of our planet was the wreck (Murphy, Wordsworth, Bush, &c). Delitzsch argues, on the ground that <span class="accented">tohu vabohu</span> implies the ruin of a previous cosmos, that ver. 2 does not state specifically that God created the earth in this desolate and waste condition; and that death, which is inconceivable out of connection with sin, was in the world prior to the fall; that ver. 2 presupposes the fall of the angels, and adduces in support of his view <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-7</a> ('Bib. Psychology,' sect. 1, p. 76; Clark's 'For. Theol. Lib.') - a notion which Kalisch contemptuously classes among "the aberrations of profound minds," and "the endless reveries" of "far-sighted thinkers." Bush is confident that <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>, in which Jehovah declares that he created not the earth <span class="accented">roan</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> conclusive against a primeval chaos. The parallel clause, however, shows that not the original state, but the ultimate design of the globe, was contemplated in Jehovah's language: "<span class="accented">He</span> created it not <span class="accented">tohu</span>, he formed it to be inhabited;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Creator did not intend the earth to be a desolate region, but an inhabited planet. There can scarcely be a doubt, then, that the expression portrays the condition in which the new-created earth was, not innumerable ages, but very shortly, after it was summoned into existence. It was formless and lifeless; a huge, shapeless, objectless, tenantless mass of matter, the gaseous and solid elements commingled, in which neither organized structure, nor animated form, nor even distinctly-traced outline of any kind appeared. <span class="cmt_word">And darkness</span> (was) <span class="cmt_word">upon the face of the deep.</span> The "deep," from a root signifying to disturb, is frequently applied to the sea (<a href="/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>), and here probably intimates that the primordial matter of our globe existed in a fluid, or liquid, or molten form. Dawson distinguishes between "the deep" and the "waters," making the latter refer to the liquid condition of the globe, and the former apply to "the atmospheric waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vaporous or aeriform mass mantling the surface of our nascent planet, and containing the materials out of which the atmosphere was afterwards elaborated ('Origin of the World,' p. 105). As yet the whole was shrouded in the thick folds of Cimmerian gloom, giving not the slightest promise of that fair world of light, order, and life into which it was about to be transformed. Only one spark of hope might have been detected in the circumstance that <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of God moved</span> (literally, brooding) <span class="cmt_word">upon the face of the waters</span>. That the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span>, or breath of God, was not "a great wind," or "a wind of God," is determined by the non-existence of the air at this particular stage in the earth's development. In accordance with Biblical usage generally, it must be regarded as a designation not simply "of the Divine power, which, like the wind and the breath, cannot be perceived" (Gesenius), but of the Holy Spirit, who is uniformly represented as the source or formative cause of all life and order in the world, whether physical, intellectual, or spiritual (cf. <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>). As it were, the mention of the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span> is the first out-blossoming of the latent fullness of the Divine personality, the initial movement in that sublime revelation of the nature of the Godhead, which, advancing slowly, and at the best but indistinctly, throughout Old Testament times, culminated in the clear and ample disclosures of the gospel The special form of this Divine agent's activity is described as that of" brooding" (<span class="accented">merachepheth</span>, from <span class="accented">raehaph</span>, <span class="accented">to be</span> tremulous, as with love; hence, in Piel, to cherish young - <a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>) or fluttering over the liquid elements of the shapeless and tenantless globe, communicating to them, doubtless, those formative powers of life and order which were to burst forth into operation in answer to the six words of the six ensuing days. As might have been anticipated, traces of this primeval chaos are to be detected in various heathen cosmogonies, as the following brief extracts will show: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">Chaldean</span> legend, deciphered from the creation tablet discovered in the palace of Assurbanipal, King of Assyria, 2. c. 885, depicts the desolate and void condition of the earth thus: - <p><span class="accented">"When above were not raised the heavens,<br />And below on the earth a plant had not grown up;<br />The abyss also had not broken up their boundaries;</span> The chaos (or water) tiamat (the sea) was the producing-mother of the whole of them," etc. ('Chaldean Genesis,' p. 62.) <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">The Babylonian</span> cosmogony, according to Berosus (B.C. 330-260), commences with a time "in which there existed nothing but darkness" and an abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were produced of a twofold principle... The person who presided over them was a woman named Omoroea, which in the Chaldean language is Thalatth, in Greek Thalassa, the sea, but which might equally be interpreted the moon" ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 40, 41).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
