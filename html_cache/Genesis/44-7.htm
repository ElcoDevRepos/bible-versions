The term "my lord" reflects the social hierarchy and respect for authority in ancient Egypt, where Joseph held a high position. This question indicates their confusion and distress, as they are unaware of the planted evidence. The brothers' response can be seen as a plea for justice and truth, echoing the biblical theme of innocence being falsely accused, similar to Joseph's own experience in <a href="/genesis/39.htm">Genesis 39</a> when he was wrongfully imprisoned.<p><b>&#8220;Your servants could not possibly do such a thing.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the brothers assert their integrity and innocence. The phrase "your servants" shows their submission and acknowledgment of the steward's authority. This declaration of innocence is significant in the narrative, as it highlights the transformation in the brothers' character since their earlier betrayal of Joseph. Their insistence on honesty contrasts with their past deceit, suggesting a moral and spiritual growth. This moment also foreshadows the ultimate revelation and reconciliation with Joseph, paralleling themes of redemption and forgiveness found throughout Scripture, such as in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to power.

Their very first response is to question the basis of the charge.<p>&#8226; They address the steward (and, by extension, Joseph) respectfully as &#8220;my lord,&#8221; recognizing legitimate authority while still challenging the accusation.<p>&#8226; The question signals shock: they truly believe there is no evidence that could point to them (compare <a href="/genesis/20-5.htm">Genesis 20:5</a>, where Abimelech pleads ignorance; also see <a href="/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a> on the injustice of condemning the innocent).<p>&#8226; On a deeper level, God is allowing them to taste what Joseph once felt when falsely accused by Potiphar&#8217;s wife (<a href="/genesis/39-17.htm">Genesis 39:17-20</a>). Their outrage is genuine, yet it echoes the earlier injustice within the family story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked.</b><p>Moses notes that the brothers speak in a single voice.<p>&#8226; Years earlier they were fractured, selling Joseph out of envy (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>). Now they stand together&#8212;an early sign of repentance and unity.<p>&#8226; Their collective appeal anticipates the oneness God desires for His people (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative pause (&#8220;they asked&#8221;) underscores that this is not rash protest but a deliberate, united plea&#8212;an important contrast to their past divisiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your servants could not possibly do such a thing.</b><p>Here they state their conviction of innocence.<p>&#8226; Calling themselves &#8220;your servants&#8221; shows humility (<a href="/genesis/42-10.htm">Genesis 42:10</a>) and a willingness to submit to investigation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Could not possibly&#8221; is absolute; they see theft as unthinkable because they have already returned the earlier silver (<a href="/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The Law against stealing will be codified later (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>), but the moral standard is already written on their hearts (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, their confidence sets up Joseph&#8217;s final test; God is refining them, exposing self-reliance so He can replace it with grace (compare <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-7.htm">Genesis 44:7</a> records the brothers&#8217; heartfelt protest against a false charge. Respectfully challenging the accusation, speaking with one voice, and declaring their innocence, they show how far God has brought them from jealousy to integrity. The verse highlights themes of justice, unity, and the moral law already at work in their conscience, preparing them&#8212;and us&#8212;for the full revelation of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - A<span class="cmt_word">nd they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
