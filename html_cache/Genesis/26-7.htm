The men of the place are likely the local inhabitants or officials. The inquiry about Isaac's wife reflects the cultural norms of the time, where a woman's marital status was of significant interest, especially in terms of alliances and social standing. This situation mirrors a similar event involving Abraham and Sarah in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a>, highlighting a recurring theme of fear and deception in the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>he said, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's response is a direct lie, echoing his father Abraham's actions in <a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13 and 20</a>:2. This repetition suggests a familial pattern of behavior driven by fear. The claim that Rebekah is his sister is a half-truth, as she is a relative, but not his sister. This deception reflects the human tendency to rely on self-preservation tactics rather than trusting in God's protection.<p><b>For he was afraid to say, &#8220;She is my wife,&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's fear indicates a lack of faith in God's promise of protection and blessing. This fear is rooted in the perception of threat from the local population, which was a common concern for travelers and foreigners in ancient times. The patriarchs often faced danger due to their outsider status, and Isaac's fear reveals his vulnerability and the precariousness of his situation.<p><b>since he thought to himself, &#8220;The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah,</b><br>Isaac's internal reasoning shows his concern for his own safety over the truth. The fear of being killed for the sake of a beautiful wife was not unfounded in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where powerful men might take women by force. This reflects the harsh realities of the time and the potential for violence against outsiders. Isaac's fear also underscores the value placed on beauty and the potential for it to incite jealousy or violence.<p><b>because she is so beautiful.&#8221;</b><br>Rebekah's beauty is emphasized, which is a recurring motif in the patriarchal narratives. Her attractiveness is seen as a potential source of danger, echoing the experiences of Sarah and later Rachel. This focus on beauty highlights the vulnerability of women in ancient societies and the lengths to which men would go to protect themselves and their families. It also foreshadows the protective role that God will play in ensuring the continuation of the covenant line through Isaac and Rebekah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.

This Philistine city is ruled by Abimelech, a title used for Philistine kings (cf. <a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The locals notice Rebekah and immediately inquire about her relationship to Isaac. This curiosity mirrors what Abram faced in Egypt and later in Gerar (<a href="/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14-15</a>; 20:2).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents this encounter as a real, historical moment; no detail is incidental. God is setting the scene to reveal both Isaac&#8217;s weakness and His own protective faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Isaac repeats the same deceptive strategy Abraham used twice (<a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>; 20:2). Family patterns of sin often re-emerge when not confronted.<p>&#8226; The statement is a half-truth. Rebekah is a kinswoman (<a href="/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>), yet calling her &#8220;sister&#8221; hides the covenant bond of marriage.<p>&#8226; The move exposes Isaac&#8217;s reliance on human scheming rather than on God, despite the Lord&#8217;s recent promise of blessing and protection (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For he was afraid to say, &#8220;She is my wife,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Fear drives deception. <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> warns, &#8220;The fear of man proves to be a snare,&#8221; and Isaac steps right into it.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God had expressly told Isaac, &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>). Forgetting that assurance, he allows anxiety to overrule faith.<p>&#8226; Fear can distort priorities, prompting even believers to compromise truths they otherwise hold dear (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-69.htm">Matthew 26:69-75</a>, Peter&#8217;s denial).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since he thought to himself, &#8220;The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is so beautiful.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Isaac&#8217;s internal reasoning highlights self-preservation.

Confronted by curious locals and concerned for his own safety, he calls Rebekah his sister. This echoes Abraham&#8217;s earlier failures and demonstrates how easily God&#8217;s people can slide into old sins when they lose sight of divine promises. Yet the surrounding narrative will show that, despite Isaac&#8217;s lapse, the Lord remains faithful, shielding both the couple and the covenant line through which He intends to bless the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">He said, She is my sister.</span>--We have already seen that Abraham at Gerar showed no consciousness of having done wrong in denying his wife (<a href="/genesis/20-2.htm" title="And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.">Genesis 20:2</a>); and we now find Isaac imitating his example with even less reason for his conduct. The circumstances are, however, different. It is the people who inquire about Isaac's relation to Rebekah, and though she was "fair to look upon," yet no annoyance followed upon his denial of her. The king after "a long time" detects their intimacy; but there are no presents, and no marks of respect to Rebekah, and no friendship. It is only after long quarrels, during which Isaac is obliged to withdraw to a long distance from Gerar, that finally peace is made between them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the men of the place</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the inhabitants of Gerar) <span class="cmt_word">asked him</span> (literally, asked, or made inquiries; probably first at each other, though ultimately the interrogations might reach Isaac himself) <span class="cmt_word">of his wife</span> (being in all likelihood fascinated by her beauty); <span class="cmt_word">and he said</span>, - falling into the same infirmity as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">She is my sister</span>: - which was certainly an equivocation, since, although sometimes used to designate a female relative generally (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>), the term "sister" was here designed to suggest that Rebekah was his own sister, born of the same parents.
