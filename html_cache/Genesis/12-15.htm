Sarai's beauty was notable even in a foreign land, indicating her exceptional appearance. This event occurs during Abram's sojourn in Egypt due to famine in Canaan, highlighting the vulnerability of the patriarchal family in foreign territories. The officials' actions reflect the customs of ancient Near Eastern courts, where women of beauty could be taken into royal households.<p><b>they commended her to him</b><br>The officials' commendation of Sarai to Pharaoh suggests a formal recognition of her beauty and suitability for the royal harem. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient societies, where the king's desires were paramount. The commendation also indicates the influence and power of Pharaoh's court, as they could bring individuals to the king's attention. This act sets the stage for divine intervention, as God had promised Abram that he would be the father of a great nation, a promise that required Sarai's protection.<p><b>and she was taken into the palace of Pharaoh</b><br>Sarai's entry into Pharaoh's palace signifies a significant turning point, as she becomes part of the royal household. This action places her in a precarious position, potentially threatening the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abram. The palace, a symbol of Egyptian power and wealth, contrasts with Abram's nomadic lifestyle. This event foreshadows future instances where God's people are placed in foreign courts, such as Joseph in Egypt and Daniel in Babylon, and highlights God's sovereignty in protecting His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the power and authority of the Egyptian kingdom.

The verse before ours notes, &#8220;When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14</a>).<p>- Sarai&#8217;s beauty is real and striking; Scripture states it plainly without embellishment. Comparable moments appear when Rachel&#8217;s appearance arrests attention (<a href="/genesis/29-17.htm">Genesis 29:17</a>) or when King Ahasuerus&#8217; servants notice Esther (<a href="/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a>).<p>- In ancient courts, officials functioned as the eyes and ears of the ruler. Their notice of Sarai sets in motion events that threaten the covenant line. Yet God&#8217;s promises never hang on chance; He remains sovereign behind the scenes (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they commended her to him</b><p>- &#8220;Commended&#8221; implies enthusiastic praise. Court officials recommended Sarai to Pharaoh as one worthy of royal attention, much like Saul&#8217;s servants later present David to the king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>).<p>- Their action highlights the cultural gap Abram sensed. A foreigner without powerful allies could be vulnerable, which explains Abram&#8217;s earlier fear-driven scheme (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>- Human commendation can open doors, but it can also propel God&#8217;s people into trials. Joseph was &#8220;commended&#8221; to Pharaoh by the cupbearer (<a href="/genesis/41-9.htm">Genesis 41:9&#8211;13</a>); here Sarai is similarly propelled into Pharaoh&#8217;s orbit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she was taken into the palace of Pharaoh</b><p>- The phrase records an actual relocation into Pharaoh&#8217;s harem. Scripture gives no hint of consent or negotiation; royal authority simply prevails.<p>- This move imperils God&#8217;s promise that Abram&#8217;s offspring will inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). If Sarai becomes Pharaoh&#8217;s wife, the lineage is compromised&#8212;yet the Lord will not allow that. Soon He intervenes: &#8220;the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram&#8217;s wife Sarai&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>).<p>- A pattern emerges: later, Abimelech seizes Sarah (<a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>), and centuries afterward, Pharaoh again oppresses Israel (<a href="/bsb/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1</a>). Each time God steps in to protect the covenant people, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14&#8211;15</a>, &#8220;He let no one oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf: &#8216;Do not touch My anointed ones; do no harm to My prophets.&#8217;&#8221;<p>- What looks like a detour inside a pagan palace becomes a stage for God&#8217;s faithfulness. Even the most powerful ruler cannot derail His plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15</a> shows three linked realities: Sarai&#8217;s evident beauty draws royal notice; enthusiastic servants usher her into Pharaoh&#8217;s presence; and the king&#8217;s power sweeps her into his palace. The verse underscores how vulnerable God&#8217;s people can seem and how indispensable His protection truly is. Though Abram&#8217;s half-truth placed Sarai in danger, the Lord swiftly acts to shield her and preserve the promise, reminding every believer that His word stands firm no matter who occupies earthly thrones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The princes . . . commended her before Pharaoh.</span>--In the days of Abram Canaan was the highway to Egypt, and so large an immigration of men of the Semitic stock found their way thither that they overspread the whole Delta, and finally, under the name of the Hyksos, made themselves masters of the throne of the Pharaohs, and retained their supremacy for several centuries. To keep out these hordes, Amenemhai had built a chain of fortresses, with a connecting wall; and though probably, as M. Chabas concludes (<span class= "ital">Rev. Arch., XVe Annee, </span>Livr. ii. 7), the Hyksos had already in Abram's time attained to empire, nevertheless, on arriving at this wall, so powerful a sheik, with so large a following, would be interrogated by the Egyptian scribes, and a report sent to the Pharaoh. The word <span class= "ital">sar. </span>translated <span class= "ital">here prince, </span>is common to the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Hebrew languages; but while in Babylonia it was the title of the sovereign, in Egypt it was applied to subordinate officers, such as those in command at these fortresses. By one of these Abram would, no doubt, be conducted into Pharaoh's presence; and on one of the sepulchres at Benihassan we find an exactly parallel occurrence in the presentation of a nomad prince, evidently of Semitic origin, who, with his family and dependents, is seeking the Pharaoh's protection, and is received by him with honour. As women did not at that time go veiled in Egypt, this custom not having been introduced there till the Persian conquest, the officers at the frontier would have full opportunity of seeing Sarai. and would, no doubt, mention the extraordinary lightness of her complexion.<p>The most probable derivation of the word <span class= "ital">Pharaoh </span>is that which identifies it with a symbol constantly used in inscriptions to indicate the king, and which may be read <span class= "ital">per-ao </span>or <span class= "ital">phar-ao. </span>It signifies, literally, the double house, or palace. This would be a title of respect. veiling the person of the monarch under the name of his dwelling, in much the same manner as we include the sovereign and his attendants under the name of the Court. For the arguments in favour of this derivation, see Canon Cook's Excursus on the Egyptian words in the Pentateuch, at the end of Vol. I. of the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary. </span>He also gives there the reasons for his opinion, in opposition to that of M. Chabas, that the Pharaoh in whose days Abram visited Egypt was an early king of the twelfth dynasty, some time anterior to the usurpation of the Hyksos.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Pharaoh&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;ar&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">officials</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yir&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
