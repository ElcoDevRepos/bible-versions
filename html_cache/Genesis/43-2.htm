The famine had affected not only Egypt but also Canaan, where Jacob and his family resided. The grain they had brought from Egypt was a temporary solution, highlighting the dire circumstances. This situation sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan for Israel. The mention of Egypt is significant, as it was a major center of civilization and agriculture, often serving as a place of refuge during famines (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>).<p><b>their father said to them</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, is the patriarch of the family. His leadership and decision-making are central to the narrative. This moment reflects his role as the head of the family, responsible for their survival. It also shows the tension between his authority and the necessity of relying on his sons, particularly in the context of the previous events involving Joseph, whom Jacob believes to be dead.<p><b>&#8220;Go back and buy us a little more food.&#8221;</b><br>This command underscores the ongoing crisis and the need for sustenance. The phrase "a little more food" suggests the scarcity and preciousness of resources during the famine. It also foreshadows the further interactions with Joseph, who is now the governor of Egypt, unbeknownst to his brothers. This request sets in motion the events that will lead to the eventual reconciliation of Joseph with his family, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham about his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). The journey back to Egypt is a pivotal moment in the narrative, emphasizing themes of repentance, forgiveness, and divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, father of the twelve tribes of Israel.
