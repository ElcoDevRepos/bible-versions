This reflects the cultural practices of the time, where maidservants could be given as secondary wives to bear children on behalf of the primary wife. The sons born to Zilpah were Gad and Asher, and their descendants are included in the tribes of Israel. This highlights the importance of lineage and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make him a great nation.<p><b>whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah&#8212;</b><br>Laban, Leah's father, was a key figure in Jacob's life, having deceived Jacob into marrying Leah before Rachel. The giving of Zilpah to Leah as a maidservant was part of the dowry or bridal gift, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This act set the stage for the complex family dynamics that would follow, including the competition between Leah and Rachel for Jacob's affection and the bearing of children.<p><b>sixteen in all.</b><br>This number includes the sons and grandsons of Zilpah, emphasizing the growth of Jacob's family. The mention of "sixteen in all" underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to multiply Jacob's descendants. It also reflects the broader theme of God's providence and faithfulness in building the nation of Israel through Jacob's lineage.
