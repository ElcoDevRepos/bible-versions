Potiphar, an Egyptian officer and captain of the guard, recognized Joseph's abilities and integrity, which led him to entrust his entire estate to Joseph. This reflects a common practice in ancient households where trusted slaves or servants were given significant responsibilities. Joseph's management skills and faithfulness are reminiscent of the biblical principle found in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, where faithfulness in small things leads to greater responsibilities.<p><b>he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.</b><br>This indicates the complete trust Potiphar had in Joseph, to the extent that he only focused on his personal matters, such as his meals. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, food was a significant aspect of daily life, often associated with religious and social customs. Potiphar's lack of concern for anything else suggests Joseph's exceptional stewardship and the peace of mind it brought to Potiphar. This trust is a precursor to the later events in Joseph's life, where his integrity is tested but ultimately leads to his elevation in Egypt.<p><b>Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,</b><br>Joseph's physical appearance is noted here, which is significant in the narrative as it sets the stage for the subsequent temptation by Potiphar's wife. The description of Joseph as "well-built and handsome" parallels the description of other biblical figures like David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>), who were also noted for their appearance and wisdom. This detail foreshadows the trials Joseph will face due to his attractiveness, highlighting the theme of external beauty leading to internal challenges. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, despite being without sin, faced temptation and trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man sold into slavery by his brothers, now serving in the house of Potiphar in Egypt.

Appearance opens doors, but integrity determines outcomes.<p>&#8211; For us: God-given looks or skills are secondary to a heart that resists sin and honors Him, as Joseph will soon demonstrate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a> spotlights three truths: (1) Joseph&#8217;s consistent faithfulness earned total trust; (2) that trust produced freedom from worry for his master; and (3) Joseph&#8217;s outward attractiveness foreshadowed testing that would reveal still deeper integrity. Together the verse reminds us that God advances those who steward His gifts well, that real leadership rests on trustworthy servants, and that character must always outshine appearance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/39-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Potiphar] left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;z&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
