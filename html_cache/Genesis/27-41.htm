The grudge is rooted in the cultural and familial importance of the birthright and blessing in ancient Near Eastern societies, where the firstborn son typically received a double portion of the inheritance and leadership of the family. This animosity foreshadows the ongoing conflict between the descendants of Esau (Edomites) and Jacob (Israelites) throughout biblical history.<p><b>because of the blessing his father had given him.</b><br>The blessing referred to here is the one Isaac mistakenly gave to Jacob, thinking he was Esau. This blessing was not just a paternal wish but was seen as a prophetic declaration of God's will, carrying significant spiritual and material implications. The blessing included prosperity, dominion, and divine favor, which were crucial for the future of the family line. This incident underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises, as Jacob was chosen to carry on the Abrahamic covenant.<p><b>And Esau said in his heart,</b><br>This internal dialogue reveals Esau's true intentions and the depth of his bitterness. In biblical literature, the heart is often seen as the seat of thought and intention, indicating that Esau's desire for revenge was deeply personal and premeditated. This internalization of anger can be contrasted with other biblical figures who sought reconciliation or forgiveness.<p><b>&#8220;The days of mourning for my father are at hand;</b><br>Esau anticipates the death of his father, Isaac, which would be a time of mourning and familial gathering. In the cultural context, mourning was a significant period marked by specific rituals and customs. Esau's plan to wait until after this period suggests a calculated approach, respecting the cultural norms of mourning before enacting his revenge.<p><b>then I will kill my brother Jacob.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals Esau's intent to commit fratricide, a grave sin that echoes the story of Cain and Abel, where jealousy led to the first murder. The threat of violence within the family highlights the destructive power of unchecked anger and resentment. This intention also sets the stage for Jacob's subsequent flight to Haran, where he would encounter God and further develop his role in the biblical narrative. The theme of sibling rivalry and reconciliation is a recurring motif in Scripture, ultimately pointing to the need for divine intervention and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, who was a skilled hunter and favored by his father.

Perhaps on this account another translation has been suggested, namely, "Days of mourning for my father are at hand: for I will slay Jacob." But there is no support for this in the Hebrew, and it represents Esau as utterly inhuman; whereas, with all his faults, he had a warm, loving heart. Genesis 28 ought to have begun here, as the break at the end of <a href="/genesis/27-46.htm" title="And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?">Genesis 27:46</a> is very injurious to the meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Esau hated Jacob</span> - a proof that he was not penitent, however disappointed and remorseful (cf. <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12, 15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him</span>: - notwithstanding the fact that he too had received an appropriate benediction; a display of envy as well as wrath, another proof of his ungracious character (<a href="/galatians/5-21.htm">Galatians 5:21</a>; <a href="/james/4-5.htm">James 4:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and Esau said in his heart,</span> - i.e. secretly resolved, though afterwards he must have communicated his intention (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 42) - <span class="cmt_word">The days of mourning for my father are at hand.</span> The LXX. interpret as a wish on the part of Esau that Isaac might speedily die, in order that the fratricidal act he contemplated might not pain the old man's heart; another rendering (Kalisch) understands him to say that days of grief were in store for his father, as he meant to slay his brother; but the ordinary translation seems preferable (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), that Esan only deferred the execution of his unholy purpose because of the near approach, as he imagined, of his father's death.
