Jacob had twelve sons, who became the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel. This familial connection is significant as it highlights the continuity of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The sons of Israel are central figures in the narrative of Genesis and the broader biblical story, representing the chosen people through whom God would fulfill His promises.<p><b>were among those who came to buy grain</b><br>This indicates that the sons of Israel were part of a larger group of people affected by the widespread famine. The need to buy grain underscores the severity of the famine and the dependence on Egypt, which had stored surplus grain under Joseph's administration. This situation sets the stage for the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams, where his brothers would bow to him, unknowingly fulfilling God's plan for their preservation.<p><b>since the famine had also spread to the land of Canaan</b><br>The famine's reach into Canaan emphasizes the widespread nature of the crisis, affecting not only Egypt but also the surrounding regions. Canaan, the land promised to Abraham and his descendants, was not immune to the natural disasters of the time. This situation forced the sons of Israel to seek sustenance in Egypt, a land they would later inhabit during the Exodus narrative. The famine serves as a catalyst for the unfolding of God's providential plan, leading to the eventual migration of Jacob's family to Egypt, setting the stage for the events of the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who traveled to Egypt to buy grain due to the severe famine in Canaan.
