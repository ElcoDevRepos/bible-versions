The mention of "the God of Abraham" connects to the Abrahamic covenant, emphasizing God's faithfulness and the patriarchal lineage. Abraham is a central figure in biblical history, known for his faith and obedience to God, which established the foundation for the Israelite nation. "The God of Nahor" refers to Abraham's brother, suggesting a shared familial deity, which may reflect the broader Mesopotamian context where multiple gods were acknowledged, but here it emphasizes a singular divine authority. The phrase "the God of their father" underscores the ancestral faith and the continuity of worship from one generation to the next. This invocation serves as a solemn appeal to divine justice, reflecting the cultural practice of calling upon a higher power to witness and enforce agreements.<p><b>So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.</b><br>Jacob's oath "by the Fear of his father Isaac" is significant in its unique reference to God. The term "Fear" (Hebrew: Pachad) is a reverential term for God, indicating awe and respect. This reflects Isaac's relationship with God, characterized by reverence and submission. The use of "Fear" as a title for God is rare, highlighting the deep respect Isaac had for the divine. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). By swearing in this manner, Jacob aligns himself with his father's faith, demonstrating continuity in the worship of the one true God. This act of swearing by the "Fear of Isaac" also serves as a type of Christ, as Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of the patriarchal promises and the embodiment of reverence and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

Laban appeals to the shared ancestral God of Abraham, Nahor, and Terah; Jacob responds by swearing in the name that his own father Isaac feared. Together these phrases affirm that God alone is the righteous Judge, the enforcer of oaths, and the Protector of His covenant people. Trust in Him, keep your word, and remember that every agreement ultimately answers to the Lord who watches over generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(53) <span class= "bld">Judge.</span>--The verb is plural, "be <span class= "ital">he judges," </span>and as Laban thus joins the name Elohim with a verb plural, it seems as if he regarded Abraham's Elohim as different from the Elohim of Nahor.

His views were thus polytheistic and so, generally, the ancients regarded the gods as local beings, with powers limited to certain districts.
