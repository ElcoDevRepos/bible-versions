The firstborn status in ancient Hebrew culture carried significant importance, often associated with inheritance rights and leadership within the family. Judah, Er's father, is a key figure in biblical history, as his lineage is significant in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>). The mention of Er as the firstborn sets the stage for the unfolding events in Judah's family, highlighting the importance of lineage and the consequences of actions within this family line.<p><b>was wicked in the sight of the LORD;</b><br>The phrase indicates that Er's actions or character were displeasing to God. The Bible does not specify the nature of Er's wickedness, but it emphasizes that his behavior was judged by divine standards. This reflects the biblical theme that God sees and judges the hearts and actions of individuals (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The concept of wickedness in the sight of the LORD is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's holiness and justice are contrasted with human sinfulness.<p><b>so the LORD put him to death.</b><br>This direct divine intervention underscores the seriousness of Er's wickedness. In the Old Testament, there are instances where God directly enacts judgment, such as with Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>. This act serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the reality of divine judgment. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come through Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>). The death of Er serves as a pivotal moment in the narrative, affecting the future of Judah's lineage and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/er.htm">Er</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Judah and Shua's daughter.

Scripture often uses this small word to warn us that what follows is unexpected and weighty (compare <a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>; <a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>). Here the narrative pivots from a wedding to a funeral, underscoring how swiftly sin can reverse human expectations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judah&#8217;s firstborn</b><p>Being &#8220;Judah&#8217;s firstborn&#8221; made Er the natural heir to a double portion (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>) and to the family&#8217;s spiritual legacy. God had already promised that Judah&#8217;s line would carry special blessing (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), so Er stood at the front of that hope. Firstborn status always carried both privilege and responsibility (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>). When a firstborn squandered that calling&#8212;think Esau trading his birthright or Reuben defiling his father&#8217;s bed&#8212;the loss was severe (<a href="/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>; 35:22; 49:3-4).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was wicked in the sight of the LORD</b><p>The text does not catalogue Er&#8217;s sins, yet it states plainly that he &#8220;was wicked in the sight of the LORD.&#8221; God&#8217;s evaluation matters most, because &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the evil and the good&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). Similar summaries of wickedness precede decisive judgment elsewhere: the generation of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>), Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>), and the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). Scripture&#8217;s brevity here reminds us that God sees motives and deeds that may never be recorded (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). Even in a family chosen for covenant blessing, unrepentant evil is intolerable to a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the LORD put him to death</b><p>The consequence is immediate and direct: &#8220;so the LORD put him to death.&#8221; This is not accident or illness but divine judgment, echoing later episodes where God preserves holiness by removing offenders: Nadab and Abihu consumed by fire (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>), Korah&#8217;s rebellion swallowed by the earth (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>), and Ananias and Sapphira struck down for deceit (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>). Such actions remind God&#8217;s people that grace never nullifies His justice. The severity toward Er also sets the stage for Tamar&#8217;s eventual role in preserving Judah&#8217;s lineage, leading ultimately to the Messiah (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-7.htm">Genesis 38:7</a> shows that covenant pedigree cannot shield anyone from God&#8217;s judgment. Er, though firstborn of a key tribe, practiced evil God would not overlook. The verse warns believers that divine privilege carries responsibility, assures us that God sees and judges sin perfectly, and points ahead to the grace that will later flow through the very line preserved by this judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord.</span> The connection between Er's name (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>) and Er's character (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) is noticeable. The special form which his wickedness assumed is not stated; but the accompanying phrase suggests that, as in the case of the Sodomites (<a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-5.htm">Genesis 19:5</a>), it was some unnatural abomination. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord slew him</span> - literally, <span class="accented">caused him to die</span>;
