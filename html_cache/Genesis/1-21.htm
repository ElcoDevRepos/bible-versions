The "great sea creatures" can be understood as large marine animals, possibly including whales and other significant sea life. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, sea creatures often symbolized chaos and were associated with deities. However, in this biblical context, they are part of God's orderly creation, emphasizing His control over all creation. This also sets a foundation for later biblical narratives where God demonstrates His power over the sea, such as in the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14).<p><b>and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according to their kinds</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the diversity and abundance of marine life created by God. The phrase "according to their kinds" suggests a natural order and categorization within creation, which is a recurring theme in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. This orderliness reflects God's intentional design and purpose. The teeming waters symbolize life and fertility, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25-26</a>, which praises God for the sea's vastness and the creatures within it.<p><b>and every winged bird after its kind</b><br>The creation of birds "after its kind" continues the theme of order and diversity. Birds are often seen as symbols of freedom and transcendence, and their creation on the same day as sea creatures highlights the completeness of God's creative work. This phrase also connects to later biblical imagery, such as the dove in the story of Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8-12</a>) and the birds of the air that Jesus refers to in His teachings (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>), illustrating God's provision and care.<p><b>And God saw that it was good</b><br>This declaration of goodness affirms the perfection and harmony of God's creation. Each act of creation is followed by this divine approval, indicating that everything God made was in accordance with His perfect will and purpose. This phrase sets a standard for understanding the inherent goodness of creation before the fall of man, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration of creation, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where a new heaven and earth are established.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is actively involved in the creation of the world and all living creatures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_sea_creatures.htm">Great Sea Creatures</a></b><br>Refers to large marine animals, possibly including whales and other significant sea life, created by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_things_that_move.htm">Living Things that Move</a></b><br>Encompasses all aquatic life, from the smallest fish to the largest sea creatures, created according to their kinds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/winged_birds.htm">Winged Birds</a></b><br>All avian life, created according to their kinds, showcasing the diversity and creativity of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation_event.htm">Creation Event</a></b><br>The specific act of God creating marine and avian life on the fifth day of creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate Creator, who designed and brought into existence all forms of life with purpose and order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_and_order_in_creation.htm">Diversity and Order in Creation</a></b><br>Appreciate the diversity of life as a reflection of God's creativity and intentional design, each according to its kind.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_approval_of_his_creation.htm">God's Approval of His Creation</a></b><br>Understand that God saw His creation as good, which calls us to value and steward the natural world responsibly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Just as God provides for the sea creatures and birds, we can trust Him to meet our needs, encouraging us to live without anxiety.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflection_of_god's_glory.htm">Reflection of God's Glory</a></b><br>Creation reflects God's glory and majesty, inviting us to worship Him and acknowledge His greatness in all things.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_1_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 1:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_21_God_s_creative_power.htm">How does Genesis 1:21 demonstrate God's creative power and authority over creation?

The term <span class="accented">remes</span> is specially descriptive. of creeping animals (<a href="/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>), either on land (<a href="/genesis/7-14.htm">Genesis 7:14</a>) or in water (<a href="/psalms/69-35.htm">Psalm 69:35</a>), though here it clearly signifies aquatic tribes. <span class="cmt_word">Which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind</span>. The generic terms are thus seen to include many distinct orders and species, created each after its kind. <span class="cmt_word">And every winged fowl after his kind.</span> Why fowls and fish were created on the same day is rot to be explained by any supposed similarity between the air and the water (Luther, Lyra, Calvin. etc. or any fancied resemblance between the bodily organisms of birds and fishes, but by the circumstance that the firmament and the waters were separated on the second day, to which it was designed that this day should have a correspondence. <span class="cmt_word">And God saw that it was good.</span> As in every other instance, the productions of this day approve themselves to the Divine Creator's judgment; but on this day he marks his complacency by a step which he takes for the first time, viz., that of pronouncing a benediction on the newly-created tribes. Nothing could more evince the importance which, in the Creator's judgment, attached to this day's work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">created</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
