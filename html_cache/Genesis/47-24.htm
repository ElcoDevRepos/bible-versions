The harvest was a time of both celebration and obligation, as it was when the fruits of labor were gathered and debts or taxes were settled.<p><b>you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh</b><br>This directive reflects the economic system established by Joseph during the famine. The 20% tax was a form of tribute to Pharaoh, ensuring the centralization of resources. This system highlights Joseph's administrative skills and the consolidation of power in Egypt, which was common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies. It also prefigures the concept of tithing, a practice later formalized in Mosaic Law.<p><b>and four-fifths will be yours</b><br>The allocation of the remaining 80% to the people demonstrates a balance between state control and personal sustenance. This division ensured that the people had enough resources to sustain themselves and continue farming, reflecting a pragmatic approach to governance and resource management.<p><b>as seed for the field</b><br>This portion was essential for future planting, ensuring the continuity of agricultural productivity. It underscores the importance of planning and foresight, principles that are echoed in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, which advises diligence and preparation.<p><b>and food for yourselves</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the provision for personal sustenance. It reflects the biblical principle of God providing for His people, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, where Jesus teaches to pray for daily bread, symbolizing trust in God's provision.<p><b>and your households</b><br>The mention of households indicates the broader family unit, including extended family and servants, which was the basic social structure in ancient times. This reflects the biblical emphasis on family responsibility and care, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>.<p><b>and children</b><br>Children are highlighted as a specific group to be provided for, underscoring their importance in biblical narratives. This reflects the value placed on future generations, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>, which describes children as a heritage from the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who rose to power in Egypt.

The instruction comes only once God has supplied a crop&#8212;reminding us that giving or budgeting is always tied to God&#8217;s prior provision. <a href="/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8</a> commends the ant for gathering &#8220;at harvest,&#8221; underscoring the wisdom of planning ahead when the increase actually arrives.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God, not Pharaoh, ultimately controls the harvest.<p>&#8226; We wait for the moment of increase before apportioning it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give a fifth to Pharaoh</b><p>&#8220;You are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh.&#8221; Joseph establishes a 20 percent tax as part of the life-saving arrangement made during the famine (<a href="/genesis/47-20.htm">Genesis 47:20&#8211;23</a>). Scripture often affirms paying rightful dues to governing authorities (<a href="/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>). While Israel would later pay only ten percent to its own king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>), Egypt&#8217;s higher rate reflects the nation&#8217;s total dependence on Pharaoh&#8217;s grain during crisis.<p>Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Paying taxes can be an act of obedience to God, provided it does not violate conscience (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Government authority is legitimate but limited; Pharaoh receives one-fifth, not everything.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Four-fifths will be yours</b><p>The verse immediately balances the tax: &#8220;and four-fifths will be yours.&#8221; God leaves a generous 80 percent in the hands of the farmers. Even under foreign rule, the Lord makes room for personal stewardship (<a href="/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>). The principle echoes <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>&#8212;people are expected to work and enjoy the fruit of that labor.<p>Why this matters:<p>&#8226; God is not a taker only; He permits and expects responsible enjoyment of His gifts (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; A fair system encourages productivity; the farmers keep most of what they grow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seed for the field</b><p>Part of the retained four-fifths is &#8220;seed for the field.&#8221; The future is in view. <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a> remind us that God &#8220;supplies seed to the sower.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s plan obliges the people to reinvest in next year&#8217;s crop, preventing a return to famine.<p>Stewardship pointers:<p>&#8226; Budget for tomorrow before spending today.<p>&#8226; Re-sowing affirms faith that the Lord will send another harvest (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Food for yourselves and your households and children</b><p>The remainder becomes &#8220;food for yourselves and your households and children.&#8221; God&#8217;s provision is personal and family-centered. Scripture places high priority on caring for one&#8217;s own (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) and assures us that the righteous are never forsaken (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>). Jesus echoes this in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>: the Father knows we need daily bread.<p>Practical outworking:<p>&#8226; Provide first for immediate family before indulging wants.<p>&#8226; Household needs are legitimate, God-sanctioned expenses (<a href="/exodus/12-4.htm">Exodus 12:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a> reveals a God-ordained balance: recognize His timing, honor rightful authority, steward generously, invest for tomorrow, and care diligently for family.
