It reflects the biblical theme that nothing is hidden from God (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenantal relationship God has with His creation, underscoring His authority to judge.<p><b>that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth</b><br>The term "wickedness" indicates a profound moral corruption that had spread throughout humanity. This echoes the earlier narrative of the Fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where sin entered the world. The phrase "upon the earth" suggests that this corruption was not localized but widespread, affecting all of creation. This sets the stage for the coming judgment through the flood, a theme of divine retribution seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart</b><br>This highlights the depth of human depravity, focusing on the internal motivations and desires rather than just external actions. The "heart" in biblical terms often refers to the center of human will and emotion (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). This phrase underscores the totality of human sinfulness, a concept that is foundational to the doctrine of original sin.<p><b>was altogether evil all the time</b><br>The repetition of "altogether" and "all the time" emphasizes the continuous and pervasive nature of human sin. This total depravity is a key theme in understanding the need for divine intervention and redemption. It foreshadows the necessity of a savior, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). This phrase also connects to the New Testament teaching that without Christ, humanity is enslaved to sin (<a href="/romans/6-20.htm">Romans 6:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and His relationship with humanity.
