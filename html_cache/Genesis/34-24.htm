It was a place where leaders and elders would meet to discuss important issues. The phrase indicates that the decision to listen to Hamor and Shechem was made publicly and involved the entire male population of the city, highlighting the communal nature of the society.<p><b>listened to Hamor and his son Shechem</b><br>Hamor and Shechem were influential figures in the city of Shechem. Hamor was the ruler, and his son Shechem was a prominent figure due to his actions involving Dinah, Jacob's daughter. Their ability to persuade the men of the city suggests their significant authority and the trust the people placed in them. This also reflects the patriarchal structure of the society, where decisions were often made by male leaders.<p><b>and every male of the city was circumcised</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). However, in this context, it was used deceptively by Jacob's sons as a means to weaken the men of Shechem for their own purposes. This act of circumcision, which was meant to be a sacred sign, was manipulated for vengeance, highlighting the tension between sacred practices and human motives. The event foreshadows the later biblical theme of the misuse of religious practices for personal gain, as seen in the New Testament when Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince.

Just as later Israel would act corporately at covenant renewals (<a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33&#8211;35</a>), so here the Hivite males unite under one resolution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>listened to Hamor and his son Shechem</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;listened to Hamor and his son Shechem&#8203;&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The men heed their rulers&#8217; persuasive appeal in <a href="/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21-23</a>, where the promise of intermarriage, trade, and shared wealth is dangled before them: &#8220;Will not their livestock, property, and all their animals become ours?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their compliance illustrates how easily people can be swayed by economic gain (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>) and by the words of influential leaders (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Amnon listening to Jonadab&#8217;s wicked counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3-5</a>), the Shechemites follow enticing rhetoric rather than moral discernment, ignoring the sin committed against Dinah and overlooking the covenant significance of circumcision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every male of the city was circumcised</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;and every male of the city was circumcised&#8203;.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Circumcision was instituted by God with Abraham as an outward sign of covenant faith (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). Yet here the surgery is stripped of spiritual meaning and used as a tool for deception.<p>&#8226; The physical act without heart commitment illustrates the danger of empty ritual (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>). It foreshadows Paul&#8217;s warning that &#8220;in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This mass circumcision sets up the men&#8217;s vulnerability on the third day (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>), when Simeon and Levi strike. Their pain exposes the folly of trusting in outward forms divorced from obedience to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24</a> records a unanimous civic decision: the Shechemite males gather at the gate, heed their leaders&#8217; promises, and submit to circumcision. The verse illustrates the power of communal authority, the lure of self-interest, and the emptiness of religious rites performed without covenant faith. What appears to be a step toward unity becomes, in the very next verses, the occasion for judgment, reminding us that true covenant signs must always flow from genuine allegiance to the God who instituted them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city</span>.
