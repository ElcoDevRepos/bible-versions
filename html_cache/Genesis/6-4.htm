This suggests beings of great stature or power. The presence of the Nephilim is mentioned in the context of increasing wickedness on earth, setting the stage for the flood narrative. Their existence is a point of intrigue and debate, with some interpretations suggesting they were fallen angels or their offspring. The Nephilim are also mentioned in <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>, where the Israelite spies report seeing them in Canaan, indicating their continued presence or influence in biblical history.<p><b>and afterward as well&#8212;</b><br>This phrase suggests that the Nephilim were not only present before the flood but also appeared again afterward. This has led to various interpretations, including the possibility of a second incursion of fallen angels or the survival of Nephilim genes through Noah's family. The persistence of the Nephilim theme underscores the ongoing struggle between good and evil in the biblical narrative.<p><b>when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men.</b><br>The "sons of God" is a phrase that has been interpreted in several ways. Traditionally, it is understood to refer to angelic beings, as seen in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> and <a href="/job/2.htm">Job 2:1</a>, where the term describes heavenly beings. This interpretation suggests a supernatural union that produced the Nephilim. Alternatively, some propose that the "sons of God" were the godly line of Seth intermarrying with the ungodly line of Cain, leading to moral corruption. This phrase highlights the blending of divine and human realms, which is a recurring theme in ancient Near Eastern literature.<p><b>And they bore them children who became the mighty men of old, men of renown.</b><br>The offspring of these unions were "mighty men," suggesting individuals of extraordinary strength or ability. The term "men of renown" implies they were famous or infamous figures in ancient history. This could refer to legendary heroes or warriors whose exploits were well-known. The narrative sets the stage for the flood by illustrating the extent of human corruption and the blending of divine and human elements, which necessitated divine intervention. The concept of "mighty men" can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate "mighty man" in His victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nephilim.htm">Nephilim</a></b><br>A mysterious group mentioned in <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, often interpreted as giants or fallen ones.

Nothing is more probable than that, at a time when men lived for centuries, human vigour should also show itself in producing not merely individuals, but a race of more than ordinary height.
