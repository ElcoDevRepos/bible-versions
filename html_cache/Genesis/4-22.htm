This genealogy highlights the development of human civilization and culture. Tubal-cain's name is significant; "Tubal" may relate to the region of Tubal, known for metalworking, while "Cain" connects him to the lineage of Cain, suggesting a continuation of Cain's legacy in human innovation and industry.<p><b>a forger of every implement of bronze and iron</b><br>Tubal-cain is noted for his skills in metallurgy, indicating an advanced level of technological development in early human history. The mention of both bronze and iron suggests a period of transition between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, though historically these ages are distinct. This phrase underscores humanity's growing ability to manipulate natural resources, which can be seen as both a blessing and a potential for misuse, reflecting the dual nature of human progress.<p><b>And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah</b><br>Naamah's inclusion in the genealogy is unusual, as women are rarely mentioned unless they play a significant role. Her name means "pleasant" or "beautiful," but the text does not provide further details about her life or significance.

Worker in brass or iron;related to Persian, <span class="accented">tupal</span>, iron dross (Gesenius, Rodiger, Delitzsch). Keil and Furst think this Persian root cannot be regarded as the proper explanation of the name. Furst suggests that the tribe may have been originally named Tubal, and known as inventors of smith-work and agricultural implements, and that Cain may have been afterwards added to them to identify them as Cainites (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Lex. sub hem.'). The name Tubal, like the previous names Jabal and Jubal, is connected with the root <span class="accented">yabal</span>, to flow, and probably was indicative of the general prosperity of the race.

Considering. the general significance of names, we shall scarcely go astray if with Kalisch we find in the name of the sister of Tubal-cain, "the beautiful," as compared with that of Adam's wife, "the living," a growing symptom of the degeneracy of the times. Beauty, rather than helpfulness, was now become the chief attraction in woman. Men selected wives for their lovely forms and faces rather than for their loving and pious hearts. The reason for the introduction of Naamah s name into the narrative commentators generally are at a loss to discover. Ingiis with much ingenuity connects it with the tragedy which some see in the lines that follow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Zillah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7779;il&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
