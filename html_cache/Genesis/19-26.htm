Her action symbolizes a longing for her past life and attachments to the sinful city, reflecting a heart not fully committed to God's deliverance. This serves as a warning against the dangers of spiritual complacency and the temptation to cling to worldly desires. In the New Testament, Jesus references this event in <a href="/luke/17-32.htm">Luke 17:32</a>, urging His followers to remember Lot's wife as a caution against looking back when called to follow Him.<p><b>and she became a pillar of salt</b><br>The transformation of Lot's wife into a pillar of salt is both literal and symbolic. Geographically, the region around the Dead Sea, where Sodom and Gomorrah were located, is rich in salt deposits, making this transformation plausible within the natural environment. Archaeologically, the area is known for its salt formations, which could have inspired the biblical account. Historically, this event underscores the severity of God's judgment on sin and the consequences of disobedience. Symbolically, salt in the Bible often represents preservation and judgment. Her transformation serves as a lasting monument to the consequences of disobedience and a reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot's_wife.htm">Lot's Wife</a></b><br>The unnamed wife of Lot, who disobeyed the angelic warning not to look back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, resulting in her transformation into a pillar of salt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, who lived in Sodom.

As regards the method of her transformation, some think that she was stifled by sulphureous vapours, and her body subsequently encrusted with salt. More probably, the earthquake heaped up a mighty mass of the rock-salt, which lies in solid strata round the Dead Sea, and Lot's wife was entangled in the convulsion and perished, leaving the hill of salt, in which she was enclosed, as her memorial. Salt cones are not uncommon in this neighbourhood, and the American Expedition found one, about forty feet high, near Usdum (Lynch, <span class= "ital">Report, </span>pp. 183 <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Entombed in this salt pillar, she became a "monument of an unbelieving soul" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/10-7.htm" title="Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul.">Wisdom Of Solomon 10:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But his wife looked back from behind him</span>, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> went behind him and looked back; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), implying wistful regard-; <span class="accented">respiciens</span> (Vulgate); <span class="cmt_word">an act expressly forbidden by the angel</span> (ver 17) - <span class="cmt_word">and she became</span> (literally, <span class="accented">she was</span>, conveying an idea of complete and instantaneous judgment) <span class="cmt_word">a pillar of salt</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); a statue or column of fossil salt, such as exists in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea. That she was literally transformed into a pillar of salt (Josephus, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Wordsworth), though not impossible, is scarcely likely. A more probable interpretation is that she was killed by the fiery and sulphurous vapor with which the atmosphere was impregnated, and afterwards became encrusted with salt (Aben Ezra, Keil, Lange, Murphy, Quarry), though against this it has been urged <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the air was not filled with "salt sulphurous rain," but with fire and brimstone; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the heaven-sent tempest did not operate in the way described on the other inhabitants of Sodom (Inglis). A third explanation regards the expression as allegorical, and intimating that the fate of Lot's wife was an <span class="accented">everlasting</span> monument of the danger of disregarding the word of the Lord, either as a covenant of salt signifies a perpetual covenant (Clark), or with reference to the salt pillars which, in a similar manner, attest the destruction of the cities (Inglis). The notion that Lot's wife, returning to the city, stuck fast <span class="accented">in terra salsuginosa</span>, like a salt pillar (Dathius), and that she perished in the flames, having afterwards erected to her memory a monument of the salt stone of the region (Michaelis), may be disregarded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/19-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But [Lot&#8217;s] wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">looked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tab&#183;b&#234;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5027.htm">Strong's 5027: </a> </span><span class="str2">To scan, look intently at, to regard</span><br /><br /><span class="word">back,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and she became</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a pillar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5333.htm">Strong's 5333: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something stationary, a prefect, a military post, a statue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of salt.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4417.htm">Strong's 4417: </a> </span><span class="str2">Powder, salt</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">OT Law: Genesis 19:26 But his wife looked back from behind (Gen.
