The evening setting emphasizes the impending darkness, both literal and moral, that characterizes Sodom. Angels often appear in Scripture as messengers of God, bringing both judgment and salvation. Their presence foreshadows the divine judgment about to befall the city.<p><b>and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city</b><br>The gateway of a city in ancient times was a place of social and legal activity, where elders and leaders would gather to discuss matters of importance. Lot's presence there suggests he held a position of some influence or responsibility within Sodom, despite its notorious wickedness. This setting highlights the tension between Lot's righteous character and the corrupt environment he chose to inhabit.<p><b>When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them</b><br>Lot's immediate response to the angels' arrival indicates his hospitality and awareness of the dangers present in Sodom. His actions reflect the cultural importance of hospitality in the ancient Near East, where welcoming strangers was a sacred duty. Lot's recognition of the angels' significance contrasts with the city's general moral blindness.<p><b>bowed facedown</b><br>Lot's gesture of bowing facedown is a sign of respect and reverence, acknowledging the angels' authority and possibly their divine nature. This act of humility is consistent with the biblical theme of recognizing and submitting to God's messengers. It also prefigures the reverence due to Christ, who is the ultimate messenger and embodiment of God's presence among humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_angels.htm">Two Angels</a></b><br>These are divine messengers sent by God.

The timing heightens the contrast between heavenly messengers and a city ripe for judgment (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city</b><p>&#8226; The city gate in the ancient Near East functioned as town hall, courtroom, and marketplace (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Lot&#8217;s presence there shows he has become a civic figure&#8212;fully integrated into Sodom&#8217;s public life (<a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a>).<p>&#8226; His position reminds us how easy it is to settle into a culture that does not honor God, even while still belonging to Him (<a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet, despite Sodom&#8217;s corruption, God still has a witness in its very gate, illustrating divine patience (<a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them</b><p>&#8226; Lot immediately rises&#8212;an act of respect and urgency. Like his uncle Abraham, who &#8220;hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>), Lot practices hospitality, a virtue Scripture consistently praises (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Getting up also signals recognition: Lot discerns that these visitors require special care, even if he does not fully grasp their angelic identity (cf. <a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God often places opportunities for service right in front of us; readiness, not reluctance, is the mark of faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bowed facedown</b><p>&#8226; Bowing low expresses humility, honor, and submission (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>). Lot&#8217;s posture communicates, &#8220;You are greater; I am here to serve.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In Scripture, bowing to heavenly messengers ultimately points to worship of God alone (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>). Lot&#8217;s reverence prepares him for the revelation and rescue to follow (<a href="/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple gesture foreshadows the call for every believer to humble oneself before the Lord (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a> portrays a dramatic intersection of heaven and earth: two angels on a mission of judgment arrive at a doomed city, where Lot&#8212;immersed in its civic life&#8212;still shows godly hospitality and humility. Evening darkness highlights moral darkness; the city gate underscores Lot&#8217;s compromised but important position; rising to meet the strangers showcases readiness to serve; bowing low models reverence. The verse reminds us that God seeks humble, hospitable hearts even in the darkest places, and He actively intervenes to rescue those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XIX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And there came two angels.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">And the two angels came. </span>It is a continuation of the preceding narrative, and takes up the history from <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm" title="And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.">Genesis 18:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Lot sat in the gate of Sodom.</span>--He had therefore become a citizen of Sodom, probably after the deliverance from the Elamite invasion, when, as a relative of Abraham, he would be treated with great honour.

Meanwhile all intercourse between him and Abraham apparently had ceased, and he had lost all share in the covenant of circumcision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came two angels</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the two angels</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the two men of the preceding chapter who accompanied Jehovah to Mature; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">to Sodom at even</span> (having left the tent of Abraham shortly after noon); <span class="cmt_word">and Lot</span> - last heard of in the narrative as captured by the Asiatic kings, and delivered by his uncle (<a href="/genesis/14-12.htm">Genesis 14:12, 16</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">sat in the gate of Sodom</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, from the idea of opening, signified the gateway or entrance of a camp (<a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26, 27</a>), of a palace (<a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a>), of a temple (<a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>), of a land (<a href="/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>), or of a city (<a href="/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>). Corresponding to the ancient forum of the Romans, or agora of the Greeks, the city gate among the Hebrews was the customary place of resort for the settlement of disputes, the transaction of business, or the enjoyment of ordinary social intercourse (cf. <a href="/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). It was probably an arch with deep recesses, in which were placed chairs for the judges or city magistrates, and seats or benches for the citizens who had business to transact. So Homer describes the Trojan elders as sitting at the Scaean gate (3. 148). In what capacity Lot was sitting in the gate is not narrated. That he was on the outlook for travelers on whom to practice the hospitality he had learned from his uncle (Peele, Calvin, Willet, Lange) is perhaps to form too high an ideal of his piety (Kalisch); while the explanation that he had been pro-meted to the dignity of one of the city judges, though not perhaps justified as an inference from Ver. 9, is not at all unlikely, considering his relationship to Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">And Lot seeing them</span> (and recognizing them to be strangers by their dress and looks) <span class="cmt_word">rose up to meet them</span>;
