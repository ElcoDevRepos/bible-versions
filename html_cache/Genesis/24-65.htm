This interaction highlights the servant's role as a mediator and guide, reflecting the importance of faithful service and obedience in biblical narratives. The servant's mission was to find a wife for Isaac, demonstrating the trust Abraham placed in him.<p><b>&#8220;Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?&#8221;</b><br>Rebekah's question indicates her curiosity and anticipation as she approaches her new life. The field is often a place of meeting and revelation in the Bible, as seen in other instances like Ruth meeting Boaz. This setting underscores the providential nature of the encounter. The man in the field is Isaac, who symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants.<p><b>&#8220;It is my master,&#8221; the servant answered.</b><br>The servant's response identifies Isaac as his master, showing the servant's loyalty and the hierarchical structure of the household. Isaac, as the son of Abraham, holds a position of authority and significance. This moment foreshadows the continuation of God's covenant through Isaac, as he is the heir to Abraham's promise.<p><b>So she took her veil and covered herself.</b><br>Rebekah's action of veiling herself is culturally significant, reflecting modesty and the customs of betrothal in ancient Near Eastern societies. The veil symbolizes her transition from maidenhood to becoming a bride, marking her new identity and role. This act can also be seen as a type of the Church, the bride of Christ, preparing to meet the Bridegroom. The veil signifies respect and the sacredness of the marriage covenant, paralleling the spiritual union between Christ and the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A young woman from Mesopotamia, chosen by God to be Isaac's wife.

Coming from a culture that prized propriety, she chooses curiosity over presumption&#8212;just as Ruth humbly inquired about Boaz before any relationship began (<a href="/ruth/2-5.htm">Ruth 2:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The focus on &#8220;that man&#8221; points to God&#8217;s providence; unknown to Rebekah, this is the covenant son through whom the promised Seed will come (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Her respectful inquiry echoes earlier moments when God&#8217;s people sought clarity before stepping forward&#8212;think of the disciples asking Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, where are You staying?&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>). It is a picture of wise caution matched with readiness to act once truth is revealed (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;It is my master,&#8221; the servant answered.</b><p>&#8226; The servant immediately identifies Isaac as &#8220;my master,&#8221; underscoring his faithfulness to Abraham&#8217;s charge (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2&#8211;4, 27</a>). He has not wavered from the mission and now gladly yields center stage to Isaac, just as the Spirit always points to the Son (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Isaac &#8220;master&#8221; also signals Isaac&#8217;s status as Abraham&#8217;s heir (<a href="/genesis/25-5.htm">Genesis 25:5</a>). The entire chapter showcases a father seeking a bride for his beloved son&#8212;a faint reflection of the Father securing a bride for Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25&#8211;27</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s concise reply moves the narrative from search to fulfillment, mirroring the moment Joseph revealed himself to his brothers: &#8220;I am Joseph, your brother&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/45-3.htm">Genesis 45:3</a>). Revelation ignites reconciliation and joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So she took her veil and covered herself.</b><p>&#8226; Veiling in that culture conveyed modesty, purity, and readiness for betrothal. By covering herself before Isaac, Rebekah signals respect and acceptance of the marriage covenant soon to be formalized (<a href="/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>).<p>&#8226; The act anticipates later scriptural images of brides adorned for their husbands (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>) and resonates with Paul&#8217;s teaching on head coverings as a sign of honor (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the veil hints at the awe of approaching one&#8217;s beloved: &#8220;You have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes&#8221; (Song of Songs 4:9). Rebekah guards that &#8220;one glance&#8221; until the proper moment, modeling chastity and reverence.<p>&#8226; Practically, her immediate response demonstrates a heart quick to obey&#8212;echoing Mary&#8217;s words centuries later: &#8220;May it be to me according to your word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a> captures three swift movements&#8212;Rebekah&#8217;s respectful inquiry, the servant&#8217;s faithful identification of Isaac, and Rebekah&#8217;s modest self-veiling. Together they spotlight God&#8217;s meticulous guidance, the servant&#8217;s Christlike role of pointing to the son, and the bride&#8217;s humble readiness. The verse invites believers to honor God&#8217;s order, recognize His appointed Son, and clothe ourselves with purity as we await our own meeting with the Bridegroom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(65) <span class= "bld">She took a vail, and&#250;covered herself.</span>--Brides are usually taken to the bridegroom enveloped in a vail, which covers the whole body, and is far larger than that ordinarily worn. At the present time the bride-vail is usually red, the ordinary vail blue or white. By wrapping herself in this vail Rebekah notified that she was the bride. After marriage it was seldom worn at this early period, and so both the Egyptians and Abimelech saw Sarah's beauty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For she had said</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and she said</span>; not before, but after alighting) <span class="cmt_word">unto the servant</span> (of Abraham), <span class="cmt_word">What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?</span> - Isaac having obviously hastened forward to give a welcome to his bride.

That married ladies did not always use the veil when traveling appears from the case of Sarah (<a href="/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>); but that brides did not discover their faces to their intended husbands until after marriage may be inferred from the case of Leah (<a href="/genesis/29-23.htm">Genesis 29:23, 25</a>).
