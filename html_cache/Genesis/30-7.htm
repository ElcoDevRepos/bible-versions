This practice is seen earlier with Sarah and Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>. Rachel, desperate for children, follows this custom by giving her servant Bilhah to Jacob. The phrase "conceived again" indicates that this is not Bilhah's first child with Jacob, highlighting the ongoing struggle between Rachel and her sister Leah for Jacob's affection and the status of bearing children.<p><b>and bore Jacob a second son.</b><br>This second son born to Bilhah is named Naphtali, as mentioned in the following verses. The naming of Naphtali reflects Rachel's feelings of struggle and competition with her sister Leah, as she declares, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed" (<a href="/genesis/30-8.htm">Genesis 30:8</a>). This reflects the intense rivalry and personal anguish experienced by Rachel. The birth of Naphtali, like that of his brother Dan, contributes to the formation of the twelve tribes of Israel, which are foundational to the history and identity of the Israelite people. The narrative underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises through complex human relationships and cultural practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who was initially barren and gave her maid Bilhah to Jacob as a surrogate to bear children on her behalf.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bilhah.htm">Bilhah</a></b><br>Rachel's maidservant, given to Jacob as a concubine to bear children for Rachel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch, son of Isaac and Rebekah, who fathered the twelve tribes of Israel.
