In the ancient Near East, water was a precious and often scarce resource, especially in desert regions like Beersheba, where this event took place. The depletion of water signifies a critical moment of survival, emphasizing human vulnerability and dependence on God's provision. This situation echoes the Israelites' later experiences in the wilderness, where they too faced a lack of water and relied on divine intervention (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>).<p><b>she left the boy under one of the bushes</b><br>Hagar's action of leaving Ishmael under a bush reflects her desperation and inability to watch her son die from thirst. The bush, likely a desert shrub, provided minimal shade and protection, symbolizing the limited human means available in times of crisis. This moment foreshadows God's intervention, as He hears the cries of Ishmael, much like He hears the cries of His people throughout Scripture (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The act of leaving Ishmael also parallels Abraham's earlier act of faith when he was willing to sacrifice Isaac, trusting in God's provision (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarah, Abraham's wife, and the mother of Ishmael.

Hagar and Ishmael have been traveling in the hot, arid wilderness of Beersheba after Abraham sent them away (<a href="/genesis/21-14.htm">Genesis 21:14</a>). Scripture consistently presents physical thirst as an urgent trial that exposes the limits of human strength and the need for God&#8217;s provision, much like Israel&#8217;s complaint at Rephidim when &#8220;there was no water for the people to drink&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-3</a>) or David&#8217;s cry, &#8220;My flesh faints for You in a dry and weary land without water&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Thirst moves the narrative from ordinary travel to life-and-death crisis.<p>&#8226; God often allows extreme need to highlight His forthcoming intervention (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the skin</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in the skin&#8230;&#8221; refers to the animal-skin container Abraham had given Hagar (<a href="/genesis/21-14.htm">Genesis 21:14</a>). A single water skin shows how limited their personal resources were. Similar containers appear when Joshua&#8217;s enemies &#8220;took worn-out sacks on their donkeys and wineskins that were old and patched&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; A skin is finite; it runs empty.<p>&#8226; Reliance on a small, man-made supply contrasts with the Lord&#8217;s inexhaustible stores (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was gone</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;was gone&#8221; marks the tipping point from scarcity to zero. Unlike Elijah&#8217;s jar of flour that &#8220;was not exhausted&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-16.htm">1 Kings 17:16</a>), Hagar&#8217;s supply truly ends, stressing that no hidden reserve remains.<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Human effort ends; divine rescue must begin (<a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4-9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern: allow emptiness to create space for His promise&#8212;He had already foretold Ishmael&#8217;s future (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she left the boy</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;she left the boy&#8230;&#8221; shows a heartbreaking maternal decision. Ishmael, about sixteen, is called &#8220;boy&#8221; to stress vulnerability. Hagar steps away much as Moses&#8217; mother placed her child in the Nile reeds (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>). Isaiah asks, &#8220;Can a woman forget her nursing child?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>). Hagar does not forget; she acts in desperate compassion, unwilling to watch him die (<a href="/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Love sometimes withdraws to spare a loved one additional pain.<p>&#8226; Even parental care has limits; God&#8217;s care does not (<a href="/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>under one of the bushes</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;under one of the bushes&#8221; describes meager shade&#8212;foreshadowing God&#8217;s later provision of a well (<a href="/genesis/21-19.htm">Genesis 21:19</a>). Like Elijah collapsing &#8220;under a broom tree&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>), Ishmael lies beneath minimal cover, symbolizing how small human shelter is compared with God&#8217;s overshadowing wings (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-4</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Sparse shade embodies life without God&#8217;s immediate felt presence.<p>&#8226; The scene prepares for the angelic voice that will break the silence (<a href="/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/21-15.htm">Genesis 21:15</a> captures the moment human resources reach absolute zero: the water is finished, hope seems gone, and Hagar sets Ishmael under a bush to die unseen. The verse underscores the literal dryness and despair of the wilderness while setting the stage for God&#8217;s dramatic intervention. It reminds us that when our skins are empty, the Lord hears, sees, and supplies&#8212;turning barren places into wells of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">She cast the child under one of the shrubs.</span>--The act was one of despair. Ishmael, though seventeen years of age, had not yet come to his strength, and at a time when human life was so prolonged that forty was the usual age for marriage, was probably not as capable of bearing fatigue as a young man nearly grown up would be in our days. He thus became exhausted, and apparently fainted; and his mother, after trying in vain to support him, cast him down in anguish, and abandoned herself to her grief.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the water was spent in</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the bottle</span>, - so that the wanderers became exhausted, and were in danger of fainting through thirst - <span class="cmt_word">and she cast the child</span> - a translation which certainly conveys an erroneous impression, first of Ishmael, who was not an infant, but a grown lad (<span class="accented">vide</span> supra, Ver. 14), and secondly of Ishmael's mother, whom it represents as acting with violence, if not with inhumanity; whereas the sense probably is that, having, as long as her rapidly diminishing strength permitted, supported her fainting son, she at length suddenly, through feebleness, released his nerveless hand as he fell, and in despair, finding herself unable to give him further assistance, left him, as she believed, to die where he had flung himself in his intolerable anguish - <span class="cmt_word">under one of the shrubs</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/21-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the water</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
