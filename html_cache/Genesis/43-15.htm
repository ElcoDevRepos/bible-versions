These were intended to appease the Egyptian official, who is Joseph, though his brothers do not yet recognize him. This act of bringing gifts is consistent with ancient Near Eastern customs of presenting offerings to gain favor or forgiveness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a> when Jacob sent gifts to Esau.<p><b>along with double the amount of silver</b><br>The brothers brought back the original silver they found in their sacks, plus additional silver to purchase more grain. This reflects their desire to demonstrate honesty and integrity, as they feared being accused of theft. The doubling of the silver can also symbolize restitution and the importance of making amends, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>.<p><b>and Benjamin as well</b><br>Benjamin's inclusion is significant because he is the youngest son of Jacob and the only full brother of Joseph. Jacob's reluctance to send Benjamin highlights his fear of losing another beloved son, reminiscent of his loss of Joseph. This moment foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and restoration of the family, a theme that echoes the redemptive work of Christ in restoring humanity to God.<p><b>Then they hurried down to Egypt</b><br>The urgency in their journey underscores the severity of the famine and their desperation for food. Egypt, a powerful and resource-rich nation, was a place of refuge during times of famine, as seen earlier in <a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a> with Abram. This journey also sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would sojourn in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p><b>and stood before Joseph</b><br>Standing before Joseph, the brothers unknowingly fulfill Joseph's earlier dreams of his family bowing to him (<a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7-9</a>). This encounter is pivotal, as it begins the process of reconciliation and reveals Joseph's role as a type of Christ&#8212;one who was rejected by his own but ultimately becomes their savior.

The brothers&#8217; compliance shows humility and respect before Egypt&#8217;s governor&#8212;unaware he is Joseph.<p>&#8226; God often uses simple acts of obedience&#8212;like packing a few regional delicacies&#8212;to advance His providential plan, just as He later used a shepherd&#8217;s sling (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>) or a boy&#8217;s lunch (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with double the amount of silver</b><p>&#8226; Earlier, the brothers discovered their silver returned in their sacks (<a href="/genesis/42-27.htm">Genesis 42:27&#8211;28</a>).
