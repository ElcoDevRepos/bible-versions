Benjamin, as the only remaining son of Rachel, Jacob's beloved wife, held a special place in Jacob's heart. This decision underscores the familial tensions and favoritism that have been a recurring theme in Jacob's family dynamics. The withholding of Benjamin also sets the stage for the unfolding drama in Egypt, where Joseph, unbeknownst to his brothers, holds a position of power.<p><b>for he said, &#8220;I am afraid that harm might befall him.&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's fear of harm coming to Benjamin is rooted in his traumatic experience of losing Joseph, which he attributes to a wild animal attack (<a href="/genesis/37-33.htm">Genesis 37:33</a>). This fear is compounded by the dangerous nature of travel during that time, which included threats from bandits and harsh environmental conditions. Jacob's protective instinct is a natural response to the perceived vulnerability of his youngest son. This phrase also highlights the theme of fear and protection that runs throughout the patriarchal narratives, as well as the human tendency to try to control circumstances to prevent further loss.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the patriarch of the Israelite tribes.
