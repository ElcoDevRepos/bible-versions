The Ishmaelites were descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar, and were known as traders. This decision shows a shift from murder to profit, highlighting the brothers' greed and lack of compassion. The Ishmaelites' presence indicates the trade routes that passed through Canaan, connecting it to Egypt and other regions. This act of selling Joseph foreshadows the betrayal and sale of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>).<p><b>and not lay a hand on him;</b><br>The brothers' decision not to harm Joseph physically is a moment of restraint, possibly influenced by Reuben's earlier plea to spare his life (<a href="/genesis/37-21.htm">Genesis 37:21-22</a>). This reflects a tension between their jealousy and a lingering sense of familial duty. The phrase also echoes the biblical principle of God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen ones, as seen in the lives of other patriarchs.<p><b>for he is our brother, our own flesh.&#8221;</b><br>This acknowledgment of Joseph as their brother and flesh highlights the familial bond that should have protected him. It underscores the moral and ethical failure of the brothers, who allow envy to override their natural affection. This phrase also points to the broader biblical theme of the sanctity of family and the consequences of fraternal betrayal, as seen in the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4).<p><b>And they agreed.</b><br>The brothers' agreement signifies a collective decision, showing their unity in wrongdoing. This consensus among the brothers illustrates the power of group dynamics in leading individuals to commit acts they might not do alone. It also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Joseph's journey to Egypt becomes a crucial part of Israel's history and God's redemptive narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who is envied by his brothers due to his dreams and his father's favoritism.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who conspire against Joseph out of jealousy and decide to sell him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmaelites.htm">Ishmaelites</a></b><br>A group of traders, descendants of Ishmael, who are traveling to Egypt and to whom Joseph is sold.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The eldest brother, who initially plans to rescue Joseph but is absent when the decision to sell him is made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of Joseph's brothers, who suggests selling Joseph instead of killing him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_jealousy.htm">The Consequences of Jealousy</a></b><br>Jealousy can lead to destructive actions.

Instead of killing Joseph, they see profit in him&#8212;&#8220;twenty shekels of silver&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>).<p>- The Ishmaelites are distant relatives, descendants of Abraham through Hagar (<a href="/genesis/25-12.htm">Genesis 25:12&#8211;18</a>). The brothers are literally handing Joseph to kin who had historically lived outside the covenant line&#8212;highlighting the brokenness of family relationships when sin reigns.<p>- Selling Joseph fulfils God&#8217;s larger plan to place him in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/45-4.htm">Genesis 45:4&#8211;8</a>), showing that the Lord can orchestrate redemption even through wrongful human choices (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And not lay a hand on him</b><p>- The brothers soothe their consciences. They will not shed blood, but they will still commit violence through human trafficking.<p>- Sin often disguises itself as a &#8220;lesser evil,&#8221; yet it remains evil (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>- This clause echoes God&#8217;s value on life (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>) while exposing the brothers&#8217; hypocrisy: they spare his life yet destroy his freedom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For he is our brother, our own flesh</b><p>- They invoke family loyalty, yet their actions betray it. Words without true love are empty (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly commands care for &#8220;your brother&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). The brothers know the right principle but choose convenience over commitment.<p>- Their acknowledgment of kinship heightens the offense&#8212;hurting those closest to us grieves God deeply (<a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they agreed</b><p>- Sin becomes corporate. Each brother is now complicit (<a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a>).<p>- Group consensus does not equal righteousness (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3&#8211;9</a>).<p>- Yet even this agreement fits God&#8217;s sovereign design: &#8220;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). The Lord&#8217;s purposes stand, turning betrayal into eventual deliverance for many (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27</a> reveals a moment when envy, greed, and compromise converge. The brothers choose profit over murder yet still commit grave sin by selling Joseph. Their rationalizations&#8212;&#8220;we won&#8217;t kill him&#8221; and &#8220;he is our brother&#8221;&#8212;cannot mask their betrayal. While they act freely and wickedly, God sovereignly uses their choice to move Joseph toward Egypt, setting in motion the salvation of their family during famine. The verse warns us about the deceptive softness of sin, the danger of groupthink, and the faithfulness of God who works even through human failure to accomplish His redemptive plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/37-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Come,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let us sell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1443;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nim&#183;k&#601;&#183;ren&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
