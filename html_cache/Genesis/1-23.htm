The use of "evening" and "morning" suggests a literal 24-hour day, a view held by many conservative scholars. This pattern of evening followed by morning reflects the Jewish understanding of a day, which begins at sunset. This structure is consistent throughout the creation narrative, underscoring the order and intentionality of God's creative work. The repetition of this phrase throughout <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> highlights the rhythm and progression of creation, moving from chaos to order.<p><b>the fifth day.</b><br>On the fifth day, God created the creatures of the sea and the birds of the air, as described earlier in <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-22</a>. This day marks a significant expansion of life on Earth, with the introduction of living beings that inhabit the sky and waters. The creation of these creatures demonstrates God's creativity and power, as well as His provision for a balanced ecosystem. The number five in biblical numerology often symbolizes grace, and the abundance of life created on this day can be seen as an expression of God's grace and generosity. The fifth day sets the stage for the creation of land animals and humans on the sixth day, further illustrating the progressive complexity and interdependence of all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who is actively involved in the creation process, bringing order and life to the universe.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fifth_day.htm">The Fifth Day</a></b><br>A specific period in the creation account where God continues His work of creation, marking the completion of another phase.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening_and_morning.htm">Evening and Morning</a></b><br>The recurring pattern in the creation account, signifying the passage of time and the completion of a day.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_orderly_creation.htm">God's Orderly Creation</a></b><br>The phrase "evening and morning" emphasizes the structured and intentional nature of God's creation.

But as regards the fifth day, its testimony is ample. In the lowest strata of rocks, such as the Cambrian and Silurian, we find marine animals, mollusca, and trilobites; higher up in the Devonian rocks we find fish; in the Carbonaceous period we find reptiles; and above these, in the Permian, those mighty saurians, described in our version as <span class= "ital">great whales. </span>Traces of birds, even in these higher strata, if existent at all, are rare, but indubitably occur in the Triassic series. We thus learn that this fifth day covers a vast space of time, and, in accordance with what has been urged before as regards vegetation, it is probable that the introduction of the various genera and species was gradual. God does nothing in haste, and our conceptions of His marvellous working are made more clear and worthy of His greatness by the evidence which geology affords.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</span> If of the previous creative days geological science has only doubtful traces, of this it bears irrefragable witness. When the first animal life was Introduced upon our globe may be said to be as yet <span class="accented">sub judice</span>. Principal Dawson inclines to claim for the gigantic foraminifer, <span class="accented">eozoon canadense</span>, of the Laurentian rocks, the honor of being one of the first aquatic creatures that swarmed in terrestrial waters, though Professor Huxley believes that the earliest life is not represented by the oldest known fossils ('Critiques and Addresses,' 9:1873); but, whether then or at some point of time anterior introduced, geology can trace it upwards through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras with the result that is here so exactly defined. Throughout the long ages that fill the interval between the Azoic period of our earth's history and that which witnessed the appearance of the higher animals she is able to detect an unbroken succession of aquatic life, rising gradually from lower to higher forms - from the trilobites and mollusks of the Cambrian and Silurian systems, up through the ganoid fishes of the Devonian and the amphibians of the Carboniferous to the saurian reptiles of the Permian periods. At this point certain ornithic tracks in the superincumbent Triassic strata reveal the introduction upon the scene of winged creatures, and with this accession to its strength and Volume the stream of life flows on till the higher animals appear. Thus geology confirms the Scripture record y attesting <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the priority of marine animals and birds to land animals; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the existence of a period when the great sea monsters, with the smaller aquatic tribes and winged fowls of the air, were the sole living creatures on the globe; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that, precisely as Elohim designed life has continued in unbroken succession since the time of its first introduction. It may also be noted that the Palaeontological history of the earth s crust suggests a number of considerations that enable us to form a conception of the fifth day's work, which, though not contravened by the Mosaic narrative, is yet by it not explicitly disclosed. For example, whereas it might seem to be the teaching of the inspired writer that the <span class="accented">tanninim</span>, the <span class="accented">tomes</span>, and the <span class="accented">birds</span> were created simultaneously, and so were synchronous in their appearance, the testimony of the rocks rather points to a series of creative acts in which successive species of living creatures were summoned into being, as the necessary conditions of existence were prepared for their reception, and indeed with emphasis asserts that the order of creation was not, as in ver. 21, first the great sea monsters, and then the creepers, and then the birds; but first the smaller aquatic tribes, and then the monsters of the deep, and finally the winged creatures of the air. This, however, is not to contradict, but to elucidate, the word of God.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evening,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6153.htm">Strong's 6153: </a> </span><span class="str2">Evening</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">morning&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1465;&#1430;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1242.htm">Strong's 1242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dawn, morning</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fifth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#238;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2549.htm">Strong's 2549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fifth, a fifth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/1-23.htm">OT Law: Genesis 1:23 There was evening and there was morning (Gen.
