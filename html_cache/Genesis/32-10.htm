This humility is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>). The kindness and faithfulness of God are central attributes, often highlighted in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89:1</a>). Jacob's use of "Your servant" indicates his submission to God's will, a posture that is essential for receiving God's blessings. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of grace, where believers recognize their unworthiness apart from Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan,</b><br>Jacob's reference to his staff signifies his initial vulnerability and lack of resources when he fled from Esau (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10</a>). The Jordan River is a significant geographical marker in biblical history, symbolizing transitions and new beginnings, as seen later with the Israelites entering the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>). The staff can also be seen as a symbol of God's provision and protection, similar to Moses' staff, which was used to perform miracles (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>). This phrase highlights God's ability to transform a situation from scarcity to abundance.<p><b>but now I have become two camps.</b><br>The transformation from a solitary traveler to two camps signifies God's blessing and multiplication of Jacob's family and possessions. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants numerous (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The term "two camps" refers to the division of Jacob's family and possessions into two groups for protection against Esau (<a href="/genesis/32-7.htm">Genesis 32:7-8</a>). This strategic move shows Jacob's growth in wisdom and leadership. The concept of "camps" also connects to the idea of God's people being a distinct community, set apart for His purposes, as seen in the Israelites' encampments in the wilderness (Numbers 2).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

He looks at himself and sees no merit that could oblige God to act. Like Abraham who said, &#8220;I am but dust and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a>), Jacob casts off any claim to entitlement. Humility is the gateway to grace (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). He owns his sin-shaped limitations rather than overlook them, and that posture keeps his focus on God&#8217;s sufficiency rather than his own resources.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of all the kindness and faithfulness</b><p>Jacob names two qualities he has experienced from the Lord: &#8220;kindness&#8221; and &#8220;faithfulness.&#8221; Scripture often pairs these terms to describe covenant love&#8212;&#8220;The LORD, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Kindness&#8212;God&#8217;s benevolent actions that protect, provide, and bless (<a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness&#8212;His unwavering reliability to keep promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>).<p>By acknowledging both, Jacob highlights not only what God does but who God is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have shown Your servant</b><p>Calling himself &#8220;Your servant,&#8221; Jacob recalls God&#8217;s prior revelation at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>) and bows under that lordship again. Servanthood frames the whole prayer: he exists to obey, God exists to command. Similar language appears in Mary&#8217;s words, &#8220;I am the Lord&#8217;s servant&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>), underscoring that true worshipers anchor identity in relationship to the Master.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan</b><p>He remembers the night he fled from Esau&#8212;nothing in his hands except a shepherd&#8217;s staff (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10</a>). That memory keeps him grounded:<p>&#8226; No wealth, no entourage, no fallback plan.<p>&#8226; Total dependence, mirroring Israel&#8217;s later wilderness sojourn (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p>The staff that once symbolized emptiness now testifies to God&#8217;s ability to build futures out of apparent nothingness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but now I have become two camps</b><p>God&#8217;s blessing is tangible. Jacob divides his household into two groups for protection (<a href="/genesis/32-7.htm">Genesis 32:7-8</a>) because the single staff has multiplied into flocks, herds, servants, wives, and children (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>). The contrast is stark:<p>&#8226; Then&#8212;one man crossing a river.<p>&#8226; Now&#8212;two companies too large to travel together.<p>This mirrors God&#8217;s promise to multiply Abraham&#8217;s seed &#8220;like the stars of the sky&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) and foreshadows Israel departing Egypt &#8220;in vast numbers&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). Provision has purpose: to advance the covenant line and display the Lord&#8217;s generosity (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-10.htm">Genesis 32:10</a> captures Jacob&#8217;s heart on the eve of crisis: humble admission of unworthiness, grateful recognition of covenant mercy, and honest remembrance of past poverty set against present abundance. The verse teaches that believers thrive when they rehearse God&#8217;s kindnesses, confess their need, and view every blessing&#8212;however large&#8212;as evidence of the faithful God who keeps His word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/32-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I am unworthy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1496;&#1465;&#1436;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;n&#601;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6994.htm">Strong's 6994: </a> </span><span class="str2">To diminish, be, diminutive, of no account</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
