In biblical terms, "remembering" often implies action on behalf of someone. Here, it indicates God's intention to fulfill His promise to Noah. This is reminiscent of God's covenantal faithfulness seen throughout Scripture, such as His remembrance of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>). It underscores the theme of divine providence and care.<p><b>and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark.</b><br>This highlights God's concern for all creation, not just humanity. The inclusion of animals in God's remembrance reflects the Genesis mandate where humans are stewards of creation (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). It also prefigures the eschatological vision where all creation is renewed (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>). The ark serves as a microcosm of God's redemptive plan for the entire world.<p><b>And God sent a wind over the earth,</b><br>The sending of a wind is reminiscent of the Spirit of God hovering over the waters in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. The Hebrew word for "wind" (ruach) can also mean "spirit," suggesting a divine act of re-creation. This parallels the new beginnings after the flood, akin to the original creation. It also foreshadows the Holy Spirit's role in regeneration and renewal in the New Testament (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>).<p><b>and the waters began to subside.</b><br>The subsiding waters mark the transition from judgment to restoration. This mirrors the theme of salvation through judgment, a recurring motif in Scripture. The receding waters symbolize the end of God's wrath and the beginning of a new covenant with Noah, which is a type of the ultimate salvation through Christ. The flood narrative as a whole prefigures baptism, where believers pass from death to life (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who remembers Noah and initiates the process of restoration after the flood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/animals_and_livestock.htm">Animals and Livestock</a></b><br>The creatures preserved in the ark, representing God's care for all His creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark.htm">The Ark</a></b><br>The vessel of salvation that carried Noah, his family, and the animals through the flood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wind.htm">The Wind</a></b><br>The instrument used by God to begin the recession of the floodwaters, symbolizing His control over nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God remembers His promises and His people.
