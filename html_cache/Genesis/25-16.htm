Ishmael is a significant figure in biblical history as he is considered the ancestor of many Arab tribes. His story is found in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16 and 21</a>, where God promises to make him a great nation. This fulfillment of God's promise is evident in the listing of his sons.<p><b>and these were their names</b><br>The naming of Ishmael's sons is significant as it reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10</a>, where He assures her that her offspring will be too numerous to count. The names of Ishmael's sons are listed in <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-15</a>, and each name carries cultural and historical significance, often reflecting the characteristics or the destiny of the tribe they founded.<p><b>by their villages and encampments</b><br>This phrase indicates the semi-nomadic lifestyle of Ishmael's descendants, who lived in villages and encampments. This lifestyle is typical of many ancient Near Eastern peoples, who often moved with their herds and flocks. The mention of villages and encampments suggests a structured society with established settlements, which aligns with archaeological findings of ancient nomadic tribes in the Arabian Peninsula.<p><b>twelve princes of their tribes</b><br>The reference to "twelve princes" highlights the organized tribal structure among Ishmael's descendants. This mirrors the twelve tribes of Israel, suggesting a parallel between Ishmael's and Isaac's lineages. The number twelve often symbolizes completeness or divine order in the Bible. The establishment of these tribes fulfills God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>, where He assures that Ishmael will be the father of twelve rulers and a great nation.

(See <a href="/leviticus/25-31.htm" title="But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.">Leviticus 25:31</a>, where it is exactly described; also <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm" title="He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.">Psalm 10:8</a><span class= "ital">&#250;, </span><a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm" title="Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.">Isaiah 42:11</a>.) It was, however, a settled and permanent place of dwelling. The other word rendered here castle, but used as the equivalent of <span class= "ital">tent </span>in <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm" title="Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.">Psalm 69:25</a>, is really a cluster of tents, the encampment of a tribe, and movable. It occurs in <a href="/numbers/31-10.htm" title="And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelled, and all their goodly castles, with fire.">Numbers 31:10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-54.htm" title="Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites: for theirs was the lot.">1Chronicles 6:54</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm" title="Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.">Ezekiel 25:4</a>. As is well known, the Arabs are divided into two classes--the dwellers in tents, who are ever moving from station to station, within certain limits, nevertheless, which they seldom pass over; and the agricultural class, who have fixed habitations, are looked upon as inferiors, and probably are the remains of a conquered race. To this day they pay a sort of rent, or black-mail, to the nobler Arabs. We find, then, this distinction already existing when this <span class= "ital">Toldoth </span>was drawn up; the agricultural Arabs dwelling in unwalled villages, while the nomad tribes pitched now here, and now there, their clusters of black camels'-hair tents. And thus we have in these words proof that Ishmael and his subjects were not all upon the same level; for while he, his sons, and his noblest retainers would dwell in tents, the inhabitants of the villages would be men of inferior origin, compelled to submit themselves to him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns</span>, - unwalled encampments, from <span class="accented">hatzar</span>, to surround; used of the movable villages of nomadic tribes (cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and by their castles;</span> - fortified keeps (Murphy); tent villages (Keil); nomadic camps (Kalisch).
