The land of Canaan, though fertile in parts, had its limitations in terms of resources. This situation reflects the agrarian society of the time, where land and its capacity to support livestock were crucial for survival. The inability of the land to support both parties foreshadows the need for separation, a common theme in biblical narratives where God&#8217;s people are often called to move or separate for His purposes.<p><b>while they stayed together</b><br>The phrase indicates the close relationship between Abram and Lot, who traveled together from Ur to Haran and then to Canaan. Their journey together signifies unity and family bonds, which were highly valued in ancient Near Eastern cultures. However, this unity is tested by practical needs, suggesting that sometimes physical separation is necessary to maintain peace and prosperity. This can be seen as a precursor to the later separations in biblical history, such as the division of Israel and Judah.<p><b>for they had so many possessions</b><br>The abundance of possessions signifies God's blessing upon Abram and Lot. Wealth in the form of livestock and servants was a sign of divine favor and prosperity. This abundance, however, also brings challenges, as it requires careful management and can lead to conflict, as seen here. The narrative underscores the biblical theme that material wealth, while a blessing, can also be a source of strife and requires wisdom to handle properly.<p><b>that they were unable to coexist</b><br>The inability to coexist due to wealth and resources points to the human tendency towards conflict over material possessions. This situation is reminiscent of later biblical stories where wealth and land lead to disputes, such as the conflicts between the tribes of Israel. It also serves as a reminder of the need for wise stewardship and the importance of prioritizing relationships over material wealth. The separation that follows can be seen as a type of Christ, who often called His followers to leave behind earthly ties for the sake of peace and spiritual growth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Hebrew people, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

Yet God had called Abram alone (<a href="/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>: &#8220;I called him alone and blessed him and increased him&#8221;).<p>- Staying together now becomes impractical, illustrating how divine purpose sometimes requires physical separation to unfold fully (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36-41</a> shows Paul and Barnabas parting for similar missional reasons).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they had so many possessions</b><p>- Prosperity is presented as a blessing from God, not the fruit of compromise (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>: &#8220;Abram had become extremely wealthy in livestock and silver and gold&#8221;).<p>- The abundance fulfills God&#8217;s earlier promise in Eden to multiply fruitfulness (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), and anticipates the covenant promise of material blessing to Abram&#8217;s offspring (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently warns that wealth can bring complications (<a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>), and here it becomes the catalyst that forces a critical decision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they were unable to coexist</b><p>- &#8220;Unable&#8221; highlights inevitability; peaceful coexistence required more space than Canaan could then provide for both clans.<p>- God uses the pressure to direct Lot toward the Jordan valley and Abram deeper into Canaan, positioning Abram for the specific land God would confirm to him (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-17</a>).<p>- The separation sets the stage for later rescue (<a href="/bsb/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>) and moral contrast between Sodom and Abram&#8217;s household (<a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7-8</a>), underscoring that God&#8217;s guidance often employs practical circumstances to advance redemptive history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a> records a literal, historical situation: divine blessing produced such abundance that Abram&#8217;s and Lot&#8217;s combined households outgrew the land&#8217;s capacity. God used this logistical strain to separate the two men, move Abram toward the exact territory He would grant him, and prepare future lessons about faith, choice, and righteousness. The verse reminds believers that material blessings are real gifts from God, yet they can also press us into decisions that serve His larger purposes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/13-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
