This act signifies reconciliation and forgiveness, as Joseph had previously revealed his identity to them. The journey from Egypt to Canaan was significant, both geographically and emotionally, as it marked the transition from famine to provision and from guilt to grace. Joseph's authority in Egypt underscores the fulfillment of his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), where his brothers would bow to him, highlighting God's sovereignty and the unfolding of His divine plan.<p><b>and as they were leaving</b><br>The departure of the brothers marks a pivotal moment in the narrative. It signifies the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the preservation and growth of his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The brothers' return to Canaan with provisions and the news of Joseph's status is a turning point that will eventually lead to the migration of Jacob's entire family to Egypt, setting the stage for the events of the Exodus.<p><b>he said to them, &#8220;Do not quarrel on the way!&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's admonition to avoid quarreling reflects his understanding of human nature and the potential for discord among his brothers. This instruction is significant in light of their past jealousy and betrayal (<a href="/genesis/37-18.htm">Genesis 37:18-28</a>). Joseph's concern for unity and peace among his brothers can be seen as a type of Christ, who also calls for reconciliation and peace among His followers (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The warning against quarreling also serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining harmony and forgiveness within the family of God, as echoed in the New Testament teachings (<a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

This is the meaning given to the passage in all the versions, and agrees with Joseph's efforts to quiet their fears, and convince them of his good intentions.
