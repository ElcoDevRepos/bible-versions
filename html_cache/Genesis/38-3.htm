The act of conceiving and giving birth is a fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, bearing a son was particularly significant as it ensured the continuation of the family line and inheritance. This birth is part of the broader narrative of God's covenantal promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which include the promise of numerous descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 15</a>:5).<p><b>and Judah named him Er</b><br>Naming in the biblical context often carries significant meaning and can reflect circumstances of birth, parental hopes, or divine revelation. The name "Er" is of uncertain meaning, but it is the firstborn of Judah, which holds importance in terms of inheritance rights and family leadership. Judah's act of naming his son signifies his recognition and acceptance of the child, which is crucial in the patriarchal society of the time. This event is part of the larger narrative that eventually leads to the lineage of King David and ultimately to Jesus Christ, as Judah's line is significant in biblical prophecy and typology (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a central figure in this chapter.

Abraham was promised in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> that his descendants would become a great nation, and each recorded birth&#8212;like Isaac&#8217;s in <a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1&#8211;3</a>&#8212;pushes that promise along.<p>- Having a son specifically is significant for tribal inheritance. As later verses show, Er becomes Judah&#8217;s firstborn, the position that ordinarily carries privilege (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>) and responsibility (<a href="/genesis/43-8.htm">Genesis 43:8&#8211;9</a>, where Judah steps up for Benjamin).<p>- <a href="/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3</a> will later list Er first among Judah&#8217;s children, proving that this verse anchors Judah&#8217;s genealogy and, by extension, the lineage leading to King David and ultimately to the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Judah named him Er</b><p>- Naming in Scripture conveys authority and expectation. Just as Adam named the animals in <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>, and Abraham named Isaac in <a href="/genesis/21-3.htm">Genesis 21:3</a>, Judah exercises fatherly leadership by giving his son a name.<p>- The act shows investment; Judah may be far from his father&#8217;s household, but he still claims his legacy by naming the child.<p>- Er&#8217;s later wickedness (<a href="/genesis/38-7.htm">Genesis 38:7</a>) contrasts sharply with the hope implicit in a father&#8217;s naming, underscoring human fallenness even within the covenant line.<p>- The pattern of fathers naming firstborn sons recurs with Boaz naming Obed (<a href="/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21&#8211;22</a>) and Joseph naming Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51</a>), illustrating continuity in God&#8217;s family-building process.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-3.htm">Genesis 38:3</a> records more than a family milestone; it shows God quietly but faithfully advancing His promises through Judah&#8217;s line. Conception demonstrates divine providence, the birth of a son safeguards covenant inheritance, and Judah&#8217;s naming act highlights paternal responsibility within God&#8217;s plan. Though Er will fail, the verse assures us that the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand firm, moving steadily toward the ultimate Redeemer who will descend from Judah&#8217;s tribe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er</span> - "Watcher" (Gesanius).
