The term "beast" encompasses a wide range of creatures, from domesticated animals to wild beasts. This reflects the order and harmony intended in creation, where all creatures have their needs met. The dominion given to humans in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a> includes stewardship over these creatures, emphasizing responsibility and care.<p><b>and every bird of the air</b><br>Birds are often symbolic of freedom and transcendence, as they inhabit the skies. In biblical times, birds were seen as messengers and signs from God, as seen in the story of Noah's dove (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8-12</a>). The inclusion of birds in this provision highlights the comprehensive nature of God's sustenance, ensuring that all forms of life are sustained.<p><b>and every creature that crawls upon the earth</b><br>This phrase covers all creeping things, including insects and reptiles. In the ancient Near East, these creatures were often seen as lowly or insignificant, yet God&#8217;s provision extends to them as well. This reflects the value God places on all life, regardless of human perception of worth.<p><b>everything that has the breath of life in it</b><br>The "breath of life" signifies the divine spark or life force given by God, distinguishing living beings from inanimate objects. This phrase connects to <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam, indicating that all living creatures share in this divine gift. It underscores the sanctity of life and the interconnectedness of all living beings under God's care.<p><b>I have given every green plant for food.</b><br>This statement establishes the original diet for all creatures, which was plant-based. It reflects a world without death or predation, aligning with the peace and harmony of Eden. This provision is later altered post-Fall and post-Flood (<a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>), but initially, it signifies a perfect creation where life is sustained without violence.<p><b>And it was so.</b><br>This phrase confirms the fulfillment of God's command, emphasizing His sovereignty and the effectiveness of His word. It echoes the repeated refrain throughout the creation account, underscoring the order and intentionality of God's creative acts. This assurance of God's provision and the establishment of His will is a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, affirming His faithfulness and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who provides sustenance for all living creatures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beasts_of_the_earth.htm">Beasts of the Earth</a></b><br>Refers to all land animals created by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/birds_of_the_air.htm">Birds of the Air</a></b><br>Encompasses all avian creatures.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creatures_that_crawl.htm">Creatures that Crawl</a></b><br>Includes all creeping things, such as insects and reptiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation_event.htm">Creation Event</a></b><br>The context is the sixth day of creation, where God provides food for all living beings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>God is the ultimate provider, ensuring that all His creation has what it needs to survive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/harmony_in_creation.htm">Harmony in Creation</a></b><br>Initially, there was a harmonious relationship between all living beings, with a shared diet of plants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_creation.htm">Stewardship of Creation</a></b><br>As caretakers of God's creation, humans are called to respect and maintain the balance and provision God established.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Recognizing that all sustenance comes from God should lead to a life of gratitude and trust in His provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/change_and_adaptation.htm">Change and Adaptation</a></b><br>The shift in dietary laws post-flood shows God's adaptability in His provision, teaching us to trust His guidance through life's changes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_1_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 1:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_30_God_s_provision_for_life.htm">How does Genesis 1:30 reflect God's provision for all living creatures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_green_plant_signify.htm">What does "every green plant for food" reveal about God's creation order?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_30_Matthew_6_26_God_s_provision.htm">How does Genesis 1:30 connect with Matthew 6:26 on God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Genesis_1_30_today.htm">How can we apply God's provision in Genesis 1:30 to our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Our_duties_to_creation_per_Genesis_1_30.htm">What responsibilities do we have towards creation, based on Genesis 1:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_30_vs_science_on_animal_diets.htm">How does Genesis 1:30 align with the scientific understanding of animal diets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Does_Gen_1_30_suggest_all_animals_ate_plants.htm">Does Genesis 1:30 imply all animals were originally herbivores?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_30_vs_today_s_carnivores.htm">How does Genesis 1:30 fit with the existence of carnivorous animals today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_ethics_of_designer_babies.htm">Did animals consume each other before the fall?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_breath_of_life.htm">What defines the breath of life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_can_isaiah_11_6-7_align_with_science.htm">How can the claim that predator and prey will coexist peacefully (Isaiah 11:6&#8211;7) be reconciled with established scientific understanding of animal behavior? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_the_bible_mention_the_paleo_diet.htm">Does the Bible mention the paleo diet?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Genesis 1:30 Mean</div><b>And to every beast of the earth</b><p>God deliberately singles out land animals first, underscoring His comprehensive care for all creation.

The phrase echoes His earlier provision for mankind in <a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>, showing that animals, like humans, rely entirely on the Creator for life and sustenance. <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a> later reminds us that the entire creation still &#8220;eagerly awaits&#8221; the fullness of God&#8217;s redemption, indicating that His concern for animals continues beyond Eden.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every bird of the air</b><p>Birds, soaring above human reach, are not beyond God&#8217;s provision. Jesus later points to them as living proof of the Father&#8217;s daily care (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>). By including birds here, Genesis affirms that God&#8217;s covenant provision extends vertically as well as horizontally&#8212;sky, land, and sea alike fall under His benevolent rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every creature that crawls upon the earth</b><p>Even the smallest ground-dwellers&#8212;often overlooked&#8212;receive specific mention.

Creation obeys effortlessly; there is no gap between divine decree and reality. The phrase also brackets Day Six, marking the completion of God&#8217;s provisioning work before His Sabbath rest (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a> reveals God&#8217;s all-encompassing care: every land animal, every bird, and every creeping creature receives life and food from Him. The verse presents an original, harmonious ecosystem where both humanity and animals thrive on plant life, reflecting God&#8217;s peace-filled design. It affirms the Creator&#8217;s authority, generosity, and meticulous attention to every living being&#8212;truths that remain foundational for understanding stewardship, compassion, and the future hope of a restored creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat.</span> The first of the three classes of plants, grass, was assigned to the animals for food. From this Delitzsch infers that prior to the introduction of sin the animals were not predaceous. The geological evidence of the existence of death in prehistoric times is, however, too powerful to be resisted; and the Biblical record itself enumerates among the pre-adamic animals the chayyah of the field, which clearly belonged to the carnivora. Perhaps the most that can be safely concluded from the language is "that it indicates merely the general fact that the support of the whole animal kingdom is based on vegetation" (Dawson). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And to every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
