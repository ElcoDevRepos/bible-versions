In the ancient Near Eastern culture, accepting gifts often implied a covenant or obligation. By rejecting even the smallest items, Abram ensures that his wealth and success are attributed solely to God's provision. This act of faith and integrity sets Abram apart from the surrounding cultures, emphasizing his role as a man chosen by God. The mention of a "thread" or "strap of a sandal" underscores the completeness of his refusal, indicating that he would not take even the most insignificant items.<p><b>lest you should say, &#8216;I have made Abram rich.&#8217;</b><br>Abram's concern is that the king of Sodom might claim credit for his prosperity. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's people are called to trust in Him rather than human alliances or wealth. Abram's actions prefigure the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized reliance on God rather than material wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24-34</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abram, where God promises to bless him and make his name great (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). By ensuring that his wealth is seen as a blessing from God, Abram maintains the purity of God's promise and sets a precedent for future generations of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is a man of faith and the recipient of God's promises.
