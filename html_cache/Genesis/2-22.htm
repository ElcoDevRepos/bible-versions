The use of "rib" signifies closeness and equality, as the rib is located at the side, symbolizing partnership. The LORD God, the covenant name of God, emphasizes His personal involvement in creation. This act of taking from the man suggests a deep connection between man and woman, setting the foundation for the biblical understanding of marriage as a union. The creation of woman from man is unique in the creation narrative, underscoring the special relationship intended between them.<p><b>He made a woman</b><br>The act of making a woman from the rib signifies God's creative power and intentional design. The Hebrew word for "made" can also mean "built," indicating a careful and deliberate process. This creation of woman is not an afterthought but a completion of humanity, reflecting God's image in both male and female. The woman is crafted to be a suitable helper for the man, as described earlier in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, highlighting the complementary roles within the divine order.<p><b>and brought her to him</b><br>This phrase illustrates God's role as the initiator of the first marriage, presenting the woman to the man. It signifies the divine institution of marriage, with God as the officiant. The act of bringing the woman to the man establishes the pattern for marital relationships, where God unites individuals. This presentation can be seen as a type of Christ and the Church, where Christ, the bridegroom, is united with His bride, the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>.

Eve is literally of the same substance as Adam, prefiguring the profound bond God designs for marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD God had taken from the man</b><p>- The Creator personally initiates and completes the act; humanity has no role in producing woman. &#8220;The LORD God&#8221; is the covenant name, stressing His relational commitment (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>- By taking from the man, God establishes headship and interdependence: &#8220;For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-8.htm">1 Corinthians 11:8-9</a>).<p>- Yet Paul quickly balances that thought: &#8220;In the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:11-12</a>). Complementarity, not competition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He made a woman</b><p>- The term &#8220;made&#8221; (also used in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>) conveys intentional craftsmanship. God builds her with artistry, purpose, and affection.<p>- Equality of worth is clear: &#8220;Male and female He created them, and He blessed them&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27-28</a>).<p>- Distinctiveness is also clear. Two sexes, each fully human, each uniquely reflecting God&#8217;s image. Jesus affirms this pattern: &#8220;Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator &#8216;made them male and female&#8217;?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brought her to him</b><p>- God Himself officiates the first marriage, presenting the bride to the groom. Adam&#8217;s joyful exclamation in <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a> (&#8220;This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh&#8221;) is the Bible&#8217;s first recorded human words&#8212;words of praise for God&#8217;s gift.<p>- Marriage is therefore divine in origin, not a human invention. <a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a> echoes the blessing: &#8220;He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.&#8221;<p>- The presentation foreshadows Christ and the Church. <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a> compares the Lord bringing His redeemed bride to Himself with this very scene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a> records a literal, historical event in which God fashions woman from man&#8217;s rib and personally ushers her to him.

Thus woman is no casual or hasty production of nature, but is the finished result of labour and skill. Finally, she is brought with special honour to the man as the Creator's last and most perfect work. Every step and stage in this description is intended for the ennoblement of marriage. Woman is not made from the adamah, but from the adam. She is something that he once had, but has lost; and while for Adam there is simply the closing of the cavity caused by her withdrawal, she is moulded and re-fashioned, and built up into man's counterpart. She brings back more than the man parted with, and the Creator Himself leads her by the hand to her husband. The anthropomorphic language of these early chapters is part of that condescension to human weakness which makes it the rule everywhere for inspiration to use popular language. He who made heaven and earth by the fiat of His will must not be understood as having literally moulded the side taken from Adam as a sculptor would the plastic clay; nor did He assume human form that He might place her at man's side. Much of this may indeed have been represented to Adam's mind in the trance into which he had fallen; but the whole narrative has a nobler meaning, and the practical result of its teaching was that neither woman nor marriage ever sank into that utter degradation among the Jews which elsewhere aided so greatly in corrupting morals and men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made</span> <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (literally, builded into; <span class="accented">aedificavit</span>, Vulgate; <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) <span class="cmt_word">a woman</span>. The peculiar phraseology employed to describe the formation of Adam s partner has been understood as referring to the physical configuration of woman s body, which is broadest towards the middle (Lyra); to the incompleteness of Adam's being, which was like an unfinished building until Eve was formed (Calvin); to the part of the female in building up the family (Delitzsch, Macdonald), to the building up of the Church, of which she was designed to be a type (Bonar); - yet it may be doubted if there is not as much truth in the remark that "by the many words used in the generation of mankind, as <span class="accented">creating</span> (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), <span class="accented">making</span> (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>), forming and <span class="accented">inspiring</span> (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), and now <span class="accented">building</span>, Moses would set forth this wondrous workmanship for which the Psalmist so laudeth God," <a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a> (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And brought her unto the man.</span> I.e. led, conducted, and presented her to Adam. "The word implies the solemn bestowment of her in the bonds of the marriage covenant, which is hence called the covenant of God (<a href="/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>); implying that he is the Author of this sacred institution" (Bush).
