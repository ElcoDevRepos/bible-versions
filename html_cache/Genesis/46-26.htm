This move was significant in the history of Israel, as it set the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and subsequent Exodus. The journey to Egypt was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). This migration also highlights God's providence in preserving the family line through Joseph, who had risen to power in Egypt.<p><b>his direct descendants,</b><br>The term "direct descendants" emphasizes the bloodline of Jacob, also known as Israel. This lineage is crucial as it traces the twelve tribes of Israel, each descending from Jacob's sons. The focus on direct descendants underscores the importance of maintaining the purity of the covenant line through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually come. This lineage is meticulously recorded in biblical genealogies, such as those found in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>.<p><b>besides the wives of Jacob&#8217;s sons&#8212;</b><br>This phrase indicates that the count of sixty-six persons did not include the wives of Jacob's sons. In the cultural context of the time, genealogical records often focused on male descendants, as inheritance and tribal identity were typically passed through the male line. The exclusion of the wives from the count reflects this cultural practice. However, the presence of these women was essential for the continuation of the family line and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>numbered sixty-six persons.</b><br>The number sixty-six refers to the total count of Jacob's direct descendants who traveled to Egypt, excluding the wives. This number is significant in the biblical narrative, as it demonstrates the growth of Jacob's family from a single individual to a burgeoning clan. The number also aligns with the broader biblical theme of God multiplying His people, as seen in His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The precision of this count reflects the importance of each individual in God's plan and the unfolding story of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is moving his family to Egypt during a time of famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph, Jacob's son, has risen to power and where Jacob's family seeks refuge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_descendants.htm">Jacob's Descendants</a></b><br>The direct descendants of Jacob who traveled with him to Egypt, totaling sixty-six persons.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's son, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and later became a powerful leader in Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>The severe famine affecting Canaan, prompting Jacob's family to relocate to Egypt for survival.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_family_and_nation_building.htm">God's Sovereignty in Family and Nation Building</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in the growth of Jacob's family, fulfilling His promise to Abraham.

By saying &#8220;All those belonging to Jacob,&#8221; Moses underscores:<p>&#8226; The completeness of the household (<a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-25</a> lists every son and grandchild).<p>&#8226; The unity of the clan moving as one (<a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1-5</a> echoes the same family list).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness: what began with one man is now a nation-in-seed form (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-22.htm">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who came to Egypt</b><p>The phrase highlights both geography and providence.

It also reminds us:<p>&#8226; Biblical genealogies often focus on the male line when tracing covenant succession (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet women are never insignificant; without them the line would end (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>numbered sixty-six persons</b><p>Moses gives the math:<p>&#8226; 66 = every son, grandson, and great-grandson leaving Canaan with Jacob.<p>&#8226; Add Joseph, Manasseh, Ephraim (already in Egypt) and Jacob himself, and <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a> totals 70.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/7-14.htm">Acts 7:14</a> cites 75, counting five additional family members born in Egypt&#8212;both figures are accurate; they measure different but complementary groups.<p>This careful tally shows God&#8217;s meticulous record-keeping (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>) and foreshadows how He will later number Israel tribe by tribe (<a href="/bsb/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a> is not a throwaway statistic.

The apparent confusion in these different numbers, sixty-six, seventy, seventy- five, will disappear if it be observed that the first takes no account of Jacob, Joseph, Manasseh, and Ephraim, while they are as palpably included in the second computation, and that Stephen simply adds to the seventy of ver. 27 the five grandsons of Joseph who are mentioned in the Septuagint version, from which he quoted, or to the sixty-six of ver. 26 the nine mentioned above, consisting of Jacob, Joseph, Manasseh, Ephraim, and Joseph's five grandsons, thus making seventy five in all.
