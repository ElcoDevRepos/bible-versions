This act was driven by a fear of extinction and a misunderstanding of God's provision. The birth of this son signifies the continuation of Lot's lineage, despite the morally questionable circumstances. This event highlights the theme of human frailty and the consequences of actions taken outside of God's will.<p><b>and she named him Ben-ammi</b><br>The name "Ben-ammi" means "son of my people" in Hebrew. This name reflects the daughter's desire to establish a new lineage and identity for her offspring. Naming in biblical times was significant, often reflecting circumstances of birth or prophetic insights. The choice of this name indicates a focus on the preservation of family and cultural identity, despite the unconventional origins.<p><b>He is the father of the Ammonites of today</b><br>The Ammonites were a significant people group in the ancient Near East, often in conflict with Israel. This phrase establishes the origin of the Ammonites, linking them directly to Lot's lineage. Historically, the Ammonites settled in the region east of the Jordan River, in what is modern-day Jordan. They played a prominent role in the biblical narrative, often opposing Israel (e.g., <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>). Theologically, the Ammonites' origin story serves as a reminder of the long-lasting consequences of sin and the complex relationships between the descendants of Abraham and their neighbors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_younger_daughter.htm">The Younger Daughter</a></b><br>The unnamed younger daughter of Lot, who, along with her sister, took drastic measures to preserve their family line after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-ammi.htm">Ben-Ammi</a></b><br>The son born to Lot's younger daughter, whose name means "son of my people" in Hebrew.
