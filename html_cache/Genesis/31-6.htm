It underscores the transparency and honesty Jacob is asserting in his dealings. This appeal to personal knowledge is a common biblical theme, emphasizing the importance of witness and testimony, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, where the testimony of two or three witnesses is required to establish a matter.<p><b>that I have served</b><br>The concept of service is central to Jacob's narrative. Jacob's service to Laban is a significant part of his life story, reflecting themes of labor, perseverance, and faithfulness. This service is reminiscent of the servitude of the Israelites in Egypt, which later becomes a foundational narrative for understanding God's deliverance and covenant relationship with His people. The Hebrew word for "served" can also imply worship or devotion, suggesting a deeper spiritual dimension to Jacob's labor.<p><b>your father</b><br>Laban, the father of Leah and Rachel, is a key figure in Jacob's story. His relationship with Jacob is complex, marked by both familial ties and tension. Laban's actions often reflect the cultural norms of the time, where family loyalty and economic interests were deeply intertwined. This relationship can be seen as a microcosm of the broader theme of familial conflict and reconciliation found throughout Genesis, such as between Esau and Jacob or Joseph and his brothers.<p><b>with all my strength</b><br>Jacob's declaration of serving with all his strength highlights his dedication and hard work. This phrase emphasizes the physical and emotional investment Jacob made during his time with Laban. It reflects the biblical principle of working heartily as unto the Lord, as later articulated in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>. Jacob's strength and perseverance can also be seen as a type of Christ, who served humanity with all His strength, ultimately laying down His life for others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is speaking to his wives, Leah and Rachel, about his service to their father, Laban.

This isn&#8217;t new information; it&#8217;s a shared memory.<p>- Scripture often calls witnesses to what people have personally observed (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a> where Samuel asks Israel to testify, and <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a> where Paul reminds believers of his conduct).<p>- By stressing &#8220;you know,&#8221; Jacob underscores transparency; nothing about his life with Laban has been hidden.<p>- That transparency gives weight to the later charge that Laban has been unjust (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>). God honors honest testimony, and here the wives themselves stand as living proof.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I have served</b><p>- Jacob&#8217;s life in Paddan-aram has been defined by service, not leisure. <a href="/genesis/29-20.htm">Genesis 29:20 and 29</a>:28 record the two seven-year periods he worked for Rachel and Leah.<p>- Service is a biblical badge of honor; even Jesus says, &#8220;the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>).<p>- Jacob&#8217;s service illustrates what <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> later commands: &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord.&#8221;<p>- The verb &#8220;served&#8221; reminds us that leadership in God&#8217;s economy is grounded in humble labor, not entitlement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your father</b><p>- Laban isn&#8217;t merely an employer; he is their father and Jacob&#8217;s father-in-law. Family ties make Jacob&#8217;s faithful service even more significant&#8212;and Laban&#8217;s exploitation more grievous (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p>- Scripture calls for honor toward parents (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>), yet it never excuses parental injustice (<a href="/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>).<p>- Jacob&#8217;s respectful reference&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t call Laban by name but &#8220;your father&#8221;&#8212;shows restraint. He confronts wrong while still acknowledging the family bond, mirroring the balance urged in <a href="/proverbs/25-9.htm">Proverbs 25:9</a>: &#8220;Debate your case with your neighbor, but do not betray another&#8217;s confidence.&#8221;<p>- The verse quietly reminds us that godly integrity isn&#8217;t nullified by complicated family dynamics.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all my strength</b><p>- Jacob&#8217;s labor was wholehearted. <a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37-43</a> details tireless shepherding techniques, proving he didn&#8217;t coast on minimum effort.<p>- <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a> exhorts, &#8220;Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might,&#8221; and Jacob exemplifies that principle.<p>- Paul echoes the same ethic when he says, &#8220;We worked night and day&#8230; so as not to be a burden&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>).<p>- Physically and mentally, Jacob gave his best, and God multiplied that diligence despite Laban&#8217;s schemes (<a href="/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9, 12</a>).<p>- &#8220;All my strength&#8221; therefore points to more than muscle; it signals undivided commitment, the same devotion God commands toward Himself in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6</a> is Jacob&#8217;s concise testimony: his wives know firsthand that he has rendered wholehearted, tireless service to their father. The verse highlights transparency (&#8220;You know&#8221;), faithfulness (&#8220;I have served&#8221;), respect within family tension (&#8220;your father&#8221;), and wholehearted effort (&#8220;with all my strength&#8221;). Together, these elements affirm that God honors diligent, honest labor and uses it&#8212;despite human injustice&#8212;to accomplish His faithful purposes in the lives of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</span> The term Jacob here uses for power is derived from an unused onomatopoetic root, signifying to pant, and hence to exert one s strength. If, therefore, the assertion now made to his wives was not an unblushing falsehood, Jacob could not have been the monster of craft and deception depicted by some (Kalisch); while, if it was, it must have required considerable effrontery to appeal to his wives' knowledge for a confirmation of what they knew to be a deliberate untruth. The hypothesis that Jacob first acquired his great wealth by "consummate cunning," and then piously "abused the authority of God in covering or justifying them" (Kalisch), presupposes on the part of Jacob a degree of wickedness inconceivable in one who had enjoyed the sublime theophany of Bethel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#234;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - second person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;ten)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1434;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have served</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5647.htm">Strong's 5647: </a> </span><span class="str2">To work, to serve, till, enslave</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7733;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my strength.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3581.htm">Strong's 3581: </a> </span><span class="str2">A small reptile (of unknown species)</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/31-6.htm">OT Law: Genesis 31:6 You know that I have served your (Gen.
