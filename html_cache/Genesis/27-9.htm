The flock represents wealth and sustenance in ancient Near Eastern culture. The act of going to the flock suggests familiarity and responsibility in managing livestock, a common occupation for the patriarchs.<p><b>and bring me two choice young goats</b><br>The selection of "choice young goats" implies a focus on quality and tenderness, suitable for a special meal. Goats were common livestock in the region, and their meat was a staple. The number two may symbolize completeness or sufficiency for the task at hand. This act of selecting and preparing animals for a meal is reminiscent of sacrificial practices, though in this context, it is for deception rather than worship.<p><b>so that I can make them into a tasty dish</b><br>The preparation of a "tasty dish" highlights the culinary skills and domestic roles within the family. It reflects the importance of food in familial and covenantal relationships. The Hebrew term for "tasty" can also mean savory or delightful, indicating a meal prepared with care and intention to please.<p><b>for your father</b><br>This phrase underscores the familial relationship and the respect and duty owed to the patriarch, Isaac. It also sets the stage for the deception that Rebekah and Jacob are planning against Esau, Isaac's favored son. The father-son relationship is central to the narrative, reflecting themes of inheritance and blessing.<p><b>the kind he loves</b><br>Isaac's preference for this particular dish suggests a personal and intimate knowledge of his tastes, which Rebekah uses to her advantage. This phrase also highlights the theme of favoritism within the family, as Isaac's love for Esau is partly based on Esau's ability to provide such meals. This favoritism sets the stage for the conflict and deception that follows, echoing the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty in choosing the younger over the elder, as seen in the stories of Cain and Abel, and later, Joseph and his brothers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

The ordinary becomes the stage for divine purpose.<p>&#8226; The flock belongs to the covenant family, underscoring God&#8217;s provision inside the household rather than from wild game; this hints at divine preference for what He supplies, not human hunting skill (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bring me two choice young goats</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Two&#8221; signals completeness for Rebekah&#8217;s plan: one for the meal, one for the disguise (<a href="/genesis/27-16.htm">Genesis 27:16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Choice&#8221; shows intentional selection&#8212;nothing second-rate will serve in fulfilling what God foretold in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>.<p>&#8226; Goats were common food and sacrificial animals (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>; 10:16); here they become instruments of God&#8217;s unfolding covenant promise.<p>&#8226; Rebekah&#8217;s decisiveness contrasts with Esau&#8217;s delayed hunt, speeding events toward the blessing (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father</b><p>&#8226; Rebekah owns the preparation: &#8220;I can make,&#8221; highlighting her knowledge of Isaac&#8217;s palate (<a href="/genesis/27-14.htm">Genesis 27:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase ties back to Isaac&#8217;s request of Esau, showing Rebekah intends to match the flavor exactly (<a href="/genesis/27-4.htm">Genesis 27:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Food often precedes covenant moments&#8212;Melchizedek&#8217;s bread and wine (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>), the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>)&#8212;signaling that God uses meals to advance His redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; The cooking itself becomes a tool for God&#8217;s sovereignty over human senses (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the kind he loves</b><p>&#8226; Isaac&#8217;s partiality is stated earlier: &#8220;Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>).
