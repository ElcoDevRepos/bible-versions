His interaction with Joseph, a Hebrew slave, highlights the divine orchestration of events. Joseph's rise from prisoner to advisor is a testament to God's providence and foreshadows the elevation of Christ from humble beginnings to King of Kings.<p><b>I had a dream</b><br>Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered messages from the divine. Pharaoh's dream, given its significance, underscores the belief that God communicates important revelations through dreams. This sets the stage for Joseph's God-given ability to interpret dreams, a gift that parallels the prophetic insights given to biblical figures like Daniel.<p><b>and no one can interpret it</b><br>The inability of Pharaoh's magicians and wise men to interpret the dream highlights the limitations of human wisdom and the futility of relying on pagan practices. This scenario emphasizes the supremacy of divine wisdom over human understanding, a theme echoed in the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as Proverbs.<p><b>But I have heard it said of you</b><br>Joseph's reputation as an interpreter of dreams precedes him, illustrating how God prepares and positions His servants for His purposes. This reflects the biblical principle that God equips those He calls, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses and David.<p><b>that when you hear a dream you can interpret it</b><br>Joseph's ability to interpret dreams is a direct result of God's Spirit working within him. This gift not only serves to save Egypt from famine but also points to the greater reality of Christ, who reveals the mysteries of God and provides ultimate salvation. Joseph's role as an interpreter prefigures Christ's role as the ultimate revealer of God's will and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, considered a god by his people, who is troubled by dreams that none of his wise men can interpret.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to prominence in Potiphar's house, and was later imprisoned.
