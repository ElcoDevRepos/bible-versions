His declaration marks a pivotal moment in the relationship between him and Jacob. This statement comes after a long history of tension and deceit, highlighting the importance of verbal agreements in ancient Near Eastern culture. Declarations were often binding and served as a formal acknowledgment of an agreement or covenant.<p><b>&#8220;This mound is a witness between you and me this day.&#8221;</b><br>The mound, or heap of stones, served as a physical symbol of the covenant between Laban and Jacob. In ancient times, such physical markers were common in establishing boundaries or agreements, as they provided a tangible reminder of the terms agreed upon. The concept of a "witness" is significant in biblical terms, as it implies accountability and the presence of a third party to validate the agreement. This idea of a witness is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, where two or three witnesses are required to establish a matter.<p><b>Therefore the place was called Galeed.</b><br>Galeed, meaning "heap of witness" in Hebrew, signifies the importance of naming places in biblical narratives. Names often carried deep significance, reflecting the events that occurred there or the characteristics of the location. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>, where Jacob names the place Bethel after his vision of the ladder. The naming of Galeed underscores the solemnity of the covenant and serves as a lasting reminder of the agreement between Laban and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah, father of Leah and Rachel, and father-in-law to Jacob.

God&#8217;s overnight warning (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>) has humbled him, echoing <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where a ruler&#8217;s heart is in the Lord&#8217;s hand.<p>&#8226; The moment parallels Joshua calling Israel together to renew covenant (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25&#8211;27</a>); a leader speaks, a marker is set up, and God is invoked as overseer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;This mound is a witness between you and me this day.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;mound&#8221; (a heap of stones gathered by both families, <a href="/genesis/31-46.htm">Genesis 31:46</a>) serves as a tangible, enduring testimony. In Scripture, physical objects often &#8220;bear witness&#8221; to covenant promises&#8212;e.g., the seven ewe lambs at Beersheba (<a href="/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>), the standing stone at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>), Samuel&#8217;s Ebenezer stone (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>).<p>&#8226; A witness pile is neutral and silent, yet it carries legal weight before God and man (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>). Anyone crossing it with hostile intent would violate the covenant (<a href="/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;this day&#8221; underscores immediacy. Today&#8217;s decision sets a lasting boundary, reflecting <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7&#8211;8</a>, which urges obedience &#8220;today&#8221; rather than postponing faithfulness.<p>&#8226; By mutual agreement, the mound guards both parties:<p>&#8211; Laban cannot pursue Jacob beyond it.<p>&#8211; Jacob cannot return to harm Laban.<p>&#8211; God stands as final Judge (<a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>), reminding us He still watches every promise we make (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore the place was called Galeed</b><p>&#8226; Naming the site seals the covenant into collective memory.

Laban&#8217;s declaration, the visible mound, and the name Galeed together form a covenant boundary under God&#8217;s watchful eye. The verse reminds us that God honors tangible reminders of promises, safeguards relationships with clear boundaries, and invites every generation to recall His faithful oversight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 48-50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.</span> The historian adding - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore was the name of it called</span> (originally by Jacob, and afterwards by the Israelites from this transaction) <span class="cmt_word">Galeed</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 21). The stony character of the regon may have suggested the designation. <span class="cmt_word">And Mizpah</span>; - watchtower from Tsaphah, to watch. Mizpah afterwards became the site of a town in the district of Gilead (<a href="/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11, 19, 34</a>); which received its name, as the historian intimates, from the pile of witness erected by Laban and his kinsmen, and was later celebrated as the residence of Jephthah (<a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>) and the seat of the sanctuary (<a href="/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>). Ewald supposes that the mound (Galeed) and the watch tower (Mispah) were different objects, and that the meaning of the (so-called) legend is that, while the former (the mountain) was riled up by Jacob and his people, the latter (now the city and fortress of Mizpah on one of the heights of Gilead) was constructed by Laban and his followers (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'History of Israel,' vol. 1. p. 347); but the "<span class="accented">grotesqusnesa"</span> of this interpretation of the Hebrew story is its best refutation - <span class="cmt_word">for he</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters (Laban's concern for his daughters, though hitherto not conspicuous, may, in the hour of parting from them, have been real: his language shows that he was not quite at ease as to Jacob's integrity. Perhaps the remembrance that he had been the cause of Jacob's taking two wives made him anxious to secure that Jacob should not improve upon his evil instructions), <span class="cmt_word">no man is with us</span>; - either then they stood apart from Laban's clan followers (Inglis); or his meaning was that when widely separated there would be no one to judge betwixt them, or perhaps even to observe them (Rosenm&uuml;ller), <span class="cmt_word">but</span> - see, God (Elohim in contrast to man) <span class="cmt_word">is witness betwixt me and thee.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 51-53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban said to Jacob,</span> - according to Ewald the last narrator has transposed the names of Laban and Jacob (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'History of Israel,' vol. 1. p. 346) - <span class="cmt_word">Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast</span> (same word as in ver. 45.
