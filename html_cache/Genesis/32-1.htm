This phrase indicates movement and progression, both physically and spiritually. Jacob is returning to the land of his fathers, fulfilling God's command to return to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>). This journey is not just a physical relocation but also a spiritual pilgrimage, as Jacob prepares to face his past, particularly his brother Esau. The journey symbolizes a return to God's promises and a step towards the fulfillment of the covenant made with Abraham.<p><b>and the angels of God met him</b><br>The encounter with angels signifies divine intervention and protection. Angels often appear in Scripture as messengers or agents of God, providing guidance, protection, or revelation. This meeting echoes Jacob's earlier vision at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>), where he saw angels ascending and descending a ladder to heaven, reaffirming God's presence and promise. The presence of angels here reassures Jacob of God's continued guidance and protection as he faces potential danger from Esau. This encounter can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, providing assurance and guidance to believers. The meeting with angels underscores the theme of divine providence and the fulfillment of God's promises throughout Jacob's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after spending years with his uncle Laban.

Delivered thus from danger from behind, Jacob now takes his journey through the country that was to be the heritage of his seed, and doubtless he was harassed by many anxious thoughts; for Esau might prove a fiercer foe than Laban. It was fit therefore that he should receive encouragement, and so after some days, probably after about a week's journey southward, he has a vision of "angels of God."<p><span class= "bld">Angels of God.</span>--Numberless conjectures have been hazarded as to who were these "messengers of Elohim," and how they were seen by Jacob. Some, taking the word in its lower sense, think they were prophets; others, that it was a caravan, which gave Jacob timely information about Esau's presence in Seir; others, that it was a body of men sent by Rebekah to aid Jacob in repelling Esau. More probably, as Jacob on his road to Padan-aram had been assured of God's watchful care of him by the vision of the angels ascending and descending the stairs, so now also in a dream he sees the angels encamped on each side of him, to assure him of protection against his brother.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> (after Laban's departure) <span class="cmt_word">went on his way</span> (from Galeed and Mizpah, in a southerly direction towards the Jabbok), <span class="cmt_word">and the angels of God</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the messengers of</span> Elohim, not chance travelers who informed him of Esau's being in the vicinity (Abarbanel), but angels (cf. <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">met him.</span> Not necessarily came in an opposite direction, <span class="accented">fuerunt ei obviam</span> (Vulgate), but simply fell in with him, lighted on him as in <a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> (LXX.), forgathered with him (Scottish); but whether this was in a waking vision (Kurtz, Keil, Inglis) or a midnight dream (Hengstenberg) is uncertain, though-the two former visions enjoyed by Jacob were at night (cf. <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10</a>).
