This act of prayer demonstrates the power and importance of intercession in the biblical narrative. Abraham's prayer is a response to God's revelation and a fulfillment of his role as a prophet (<a href="/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>). This moment foreshadows the priestly intercession of Christ, who mediates on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>and God healed Abimelech</b><br>The healing of Abimelech signifies God's mercy and willingness to restore those who have been wronged or afflicted. Abimelech, a Philistine king, had unknowingly taken Sarah, Abraham's wife, into his household, believing her to be Abraham's sister. God's intervention and subsequent healing underscore His sovereignty and justice. This event also illustrates the theme of divine protection over the covenant family, ensuring the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham.<p><b>and his wife and his maidservants</b><br>The inclusion of Abimelech's wife and maidservants in the healing process emphasizes the communal aspect of God's actions. It reflects the cultural context of the time, where a king's household was integral to his reign and prosperity. The healing of the women in Abimelech's household also serves to restore the social and familial order disrupted by the earlier events.<p><b>so that they could again bear children&#8212;</b><br>The ability to bear children is a sign of God's blessing and favor in the biblical narrative. The restoration of fertility to Abimelech's household is significant, as it not only rectifies the immediate situation but also ensures the continuation of his lineage. This act of restoration parallels God's promise to Abraham and Sarah regarding their own descendants, highlighting the theme of divine faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.
