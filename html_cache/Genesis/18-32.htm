Abraham's persistence in negotiating with God reflects his deep concern for the righteous in Sodom and his understanding of God's justice and mercy.<p><b>&#8220;May the Lord not be angry,</b><br>Abraham approaches God with humility and reverence, acknowledging God's sovereignty and righteousness. This reflects the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where approaching a deity required respect and acknowledgment of one's own position.<p><b>but let me speak once more.</b><br>Abraham's request to speak again highlights his boldness and faith. It also demonstrates the relational aspect of God, who allows His people to engage with Him in dialogue. This interaction is reminiscent of Moses' later intercessions for Israel.<p><b>Suppose ten are found there?&#8221;</b><br>Abraham's negotiation down to ten righteous individuals underscores the severity of Sodom's wickedness. The number ten is significant in Jewish tradition, often representing a quorum or minimum number for communal religious practices, such as a minyan.<p><b>And He answered,</b><br>God's response indicates His willingness to listen and engage with human concerns. This interaction exemplifies the personal nature of God, who is not distant but involved in the affairs of humanity.<p><b>&#8220;On account of the ten, I will not destroy it.&#8221;</b><br>God's agreement to spare the city for the sake of ten righteous people highlights His mercy and justice. This foreshadows the concept of a remnant, a theme throughout Scripture where a small group of faithful individuals can bring about God's favor. It also points to the ultimate intercessor, Jesus Christ, whose righteousness spares humanity from destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

After five prior petitions (<a href="/genesis/18-24.htm">Genesis 18:24-31</a>), Abraham speaks yet again, showing that a believer may approach the Lord repeatedly with confidence. As <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> declares, &#8220;Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.&#8221; Abraham trusts God&#8217;s willingness to hear, even when judgment is looming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May the Lord not be angry</b><p>Reverence seasons Abraham&#8217;s boldness. He knows God is perfectly just and has every right to judge sin, yet he appeals to mercy. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3-4</a> adds, &#8220;If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities&#8230;who could stand? But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be feared.&#8221; Genuine fear of God does not silence prayer; it shapes it with humility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but let me speak once more</b><p>Persistence marks true intercession. Abraham is not bargaining for personal gain; he is standing in the gap for others. Jesus taught the same spirit in <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>: &#8220;Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart.&#8221; Paul echoes it in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, &#8220;Pray without ceasing.&#8221; Faith keeps asking until God either grants or clearly closes the door.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Suppose ten are found there?</b><p>Abraham&#8217;s final proposal drops from fifty to ten, implying that a minimal righteous &#8220;remnant&#8221; might spare the whole region. <a href="/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a> pictures the same principle: if only one just person were found in Jerusalem, judgment would have been withheld. Jesus calls His followers &#8220;the salt of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>), underscoring how even a small righteous presence preserves a community. <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a> later notes, &#8220;So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And He answered</b><p>God immediately responds, proving that He listens to heartfelt petitions. <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a> assures, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a> affirms that if we ask according to His will, He hears and answers. Divine justice does not negate divine attentiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On account of the ten, I will not destroy it</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s reply reveals His mercy: He would spare an entire wicked city for the sake of ten righteous people. This matches <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, &#8220;The Lord&#8230;is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.&#8221; It also echoes <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>, where God searched for someone to &#8220;stand before Me in the gap&#8230;so that I would not destroy it.&#8221; Tragically, fewer than ten righteous were found, and judgment came (<a href="/bsb/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>). Yet the principle stands: a remnant can stay wrath. <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> later acknowledges, &#8220;Unless the LORD of Hosts had left us a few survivors, we would have become like Sodom.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a> records the climactic moment of Abraham&#8217;s intercession. His respectful persistence, rooted in awe of God and love for people, draws out a stunning promise: the Lord would spare Sodom if merely ten righteous lived there. The exchange demonstrates God&#8217;s readiness to relent when righteousness&#8212;no matter how small&#8212;appears, while also confirming that judgment will fall where none is found. Believers today are called to the same prayerful role, confident that the God who answered Abraham still listens and acts with perfect justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), and <span class="cmt_word">I will speak but this once</span> (literally, <span class="accented">only this time more</span>, as in <a href="/exodus/10-17.htm">Exodus 10:17</a>): <span class="cmt_word">Peradventure ten shall be found there.
