Sidon, his firstborn, is historically and geographically important as the founder of the city of Sidon, one of the principal cities of Phoenicia. Sidon is frequently mentioned in the Bible, often in the context of trade and idolatry (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2-4</a>). The city of Sidon was known for its wealth and influence in the ancient world, and its people were skilled in navigation and trade, contributing to the spread of the Phoenician alphabet. The mention of Sidon as the firstborn highlights the prominence of this city in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and of the Hittites</b><br>The Hittites were an ancient people who established a significant empire in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and had interactions with various biblical figures, including Abraham and David. They are mentioned in several biblical passages, such as <a href="/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>, where Abraham purchases a burial site from Ephron the Hittite. The Hittites are also noted for their advanced legal and governmental systems, as well as their military prowess. Archaeological discoveries, such as the Hittite capital at Hattusa, have provided insight into their culture and influence. The inclusion of the Hittites in this genealogy underscores the diverse and complex relationships between the descendants of Canaan and the Israelites throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The son of Ham and grandson of Noah, Canaan is the progenitor of the Canaanites, a group of ancient people who lived in the land that would later become Israel.

They had probably been driven thence by the pressure of Semitic races, with whose language they had thus already become familiar; and when, farther, they found a Semitic people thinly spread over Palestine, they may, while absorbing them, have been confirmed in the use of their tongue. So, subsequently, Abraham gave up Syriac for Hebrew; and though these are kindred dialects, yet they are often remote enough from one another (see <a href="/genesis/31-47.htm" title="And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.">Genesis 31:47</a>). On the other hand, the whole character of the Canaanite religion and thought was Hamitic, and while they Were active in commercial pursuits, and in culture far in advance of the Greeks, to whom they gave their alphabet, they were intensely sensuous in their worship and voluptuous in their manners. They are divided into eleven tribes, namely:--<p>1.<span class= "bld"> Sidon.</span>--This is remarkable as being the only town mentioned in the account either of Mizraim or of Canaan. All the rest are apparently the names of tribes still wandering about; and thus we gain a clearer idea both of the antiquity of this early record, and also of the great advance made by Nimrod in founding so many cities. Sidon, situated on the sea-shore, about thirty miles north of Tyre, became thus early a settled community and the seat of social life, because of its advantages for fishing (whence its name is derived), and also for commerce.<p>2.<span class= "bld"> Heth.</span>--The Kheta, or Hittites, a powerful race, whose language and monuments have recently become the object of careful study. They seem subsequently to have possessed not only Syria, but a large portion of Asia Minor. (See Note on <a href="/genesis/23-3.htm" title="And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,">Genesis 23:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/23-5.htm" title="And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,">Genesis 23:5</a>.)<p>3.<span class= "bld"> The Jebusite.</span>--This race held the territory afterwards occupied by Benjamin, and retained Jerusalem until the time of David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/5-6.htm" title="And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.">2Samuel 5:6-9</a>.
