The bread and lentil stew symbolize the immediate, tangible satisfaction that Esau chooses over his long-term inheritance. In the cultural context of the time, a birthright was a significant privilege, granting the firstborn son a double portion of the inheritance and leadership of the family. This act foreshadows the later tension between Jacob and Esau, as well as the broader theme of God's sovereignty in choosing Jacob over Esau, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-13.htm">Romans 9:13</a>.<p><b>who ate and drank and then got up and went away</b><br>Esau's actions here are quick and dismissive, indicating his lack of appreciation for the birthright. The verbs "ate," "drank," "got up," and "went away" suggest a transactional and indifferent attitude. This reflects a broader biblical theme of valuing spiritual blessings over immediate physical needs, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, where Jesus teaches to seek first the kingdom of God.<p><b>Thus Esau despised his birthright</b><br>The word "despised" indicates a deep disregard and contempt for something valuable. In <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>, Esau is described as "godless" for trading his birthright for a single meal, serving as a warning against prioritizing temporary desires over eternal blessings. This moment is pivotal in the narrative of Genesis, as it sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham through Jacob, rather than Esau. The birthright, in a typological sense, can be seen as a precursor to the inheritance believers receive through Christ, emphasizing the importance of valuing spiritual heritage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, known for his cunning and desire for the birthright and blessing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, a skilled hunter, who impulsively traded his birthright for a meal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/birthright.htm">Birthright</a></b><br>A significant inheritance right in ancient Hebrew culture, typically given to the firstborn son, including leadership of the family and a double portion of the inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lentil_stew.htm">Lentil Stew</a></b><br>The meal Jacob prepared, which Esau accepted in exchange for his birthright, symbolizing Esau's shortsightedness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/despised.htm">Despised</a></b><br>The Hebrew word used here is (bazah), meaning to hold in contempt or to regard as worthless, indicating Esau's disregard for his birthright.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_spiritual_inheritance.htm">Value of Spiritual Inheritance</a></b><br>Just as Esau undervalued his birthright, we must be careful not to undervalue our spiritual inheritance in Christ.

There is no regret, no sad feeling that he had prolonged his life at too high a cost. And if Jacob is cunning, and mean in the advantage he took of his brother, still he valued these privileges, and in the sequel he had his reward and his punishment. He was confirmed in the possession of the birthright, and became the progenitor of the chosen race, and of the Messiah; but henceforward his life was full of danger and difficulty. He had to flee from his brother's enmity, and was perpetually the victim of fraud and the most cruel deceit. But gradually his character ripened for good. He ceased to be a scheming, worldly-minded Jacob, and became an Israel, and in his pious old age we see a man full of trust and faith in God, unworldly and unselfish, and animated by tender and loving feeling. Purified from his early infirmities, and with all his better nature strengthened and sanctified by sorrow, he shows himself worthy of his second name, and becomes "a prince with God."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils</span>.
