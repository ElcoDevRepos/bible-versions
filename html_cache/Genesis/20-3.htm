This reflects the belief that God can directly intervene in human affairs. Abimelech, the king of Gerar, is a Gentile, yet God chooses to communicate with him, demonstrating His sovereignty over all nations. This dream is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God uses dreams to convey important messages, such as with Joseph (Genesis 37) and Pharaoh (Genesis 41).<p><b>and told him, &#8220;You are as good as dead</b><br>The phrase "as good as dead" indicates the severity of the situation. In biblical terms, death is often a consequence of sin or disobedience to God's commands. This warning underscores the seriousness of taking another man's wife, which is a violation of the sanctity of marriage established by God. It also highlights God's justice and the moral order He upholds.<p><b>because of the woman you have taken,</b><br>The woman in question is Sarah, Abraham's wife. This situation arises because Abraham, fearing for his life, misleads Abimelech by claiming Sarah is his sister. This reflects the recurring theme of human frailty and the consequences of deceit. The taking of Sarah by Abimelech, though done in ignorance, still requires divine intervention to prevent sin, illustrating God's protective care over His covenant promises.<p><b>for she is a married woman.&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on Sarah being a married woman highlights the sanctity of marriage as ordained by God. This incident prefigures the importance of marital fidelity, which is later codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching on the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>), where marriage is a type of the relationship between Christ and the Church.

Scripture treats the timing literally, underscoring that the Lord intervenes in real history at precise moments (cf. <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25&#8211;26</a>). The event happens after Abimelech has taken Sarah into his household, showing that even while humans sleep, God actively safeguards His covenant plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>however</b><p>The word signals a decisive turn in the narrative. Human plans&#8212;Abraham&#8217;s half-truth and Abimelech&#8217;s ignorance&#8212;were steering events, however God steps in and redirects them (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>). The contrast highlights the Lord&#8217;s sovereign overruling of potential sin that would threaten the promised lineage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God came to Abimelech in a dream</b><p>Divine dreams are a frequent, literal means of revelation:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a> &#8211; God warns Laban;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a> &#8211; God speaks to Solomon;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12</a> &#8211; God protects the Christ-child by warning the Magi.<p>The text affirms that the living God personally communicated, not through omens or guesses but by direct initiative, confirming His intimate governance over pagan as well as covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told him</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s message is clear, verbal, and authoritative, reminding us that &#8220;the word of the LORD is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>). When God speaks, He expects obedience (cf. <a href="/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2&#8211;3</a>). Abimelech cannot plead ignorance once God has spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You are as good as dead&#8230;&#8221;</b><p>A stark verdict: life is forfeited. Similar warnings punctuate Scripture&#8212;Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4&#8211;5</a> and David after his census in <a href="/2_samuel/24-10.htm">2 Samuel 24:10&#8211;15</a>&#8212;revealing that holy justice is not theoretical. <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> affirms that &#8220;the wages of sin is death,&#8221; and here that penalty looms over Abimelech.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of the woman you have taken</b><p>Specific sin is identified. Like Adam&#8217;s taking of the forbidden fruit (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>), Abimelech&#8217;s action incurs guilt even though he acted with limited knowledge. The Lord pinpoints wrongdoing so repentance can be equally specific (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for she is a married woman</b><p>The marriage covenant matters to God. <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> lays the foundation; <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a> forbids adultery; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a> esteems the marriage bed. By threatening death for violating Sarah&#8217;s marriage, God defends both His moral law and the purity of the line through which Messiah will come (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a> shows God interrupting a dangerous situation to protect marriage, preserve His redemptive plan, and uphold His justice. The verse reminds us that the Lord sees hidden threats, speaks unmistakably, and defends His covenant purposes with life-and-death seriousness, calling all people to respect His holy boundaries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">God (Elohim)</span> <span class= "bld">came . . . --</span>From the use of this title of the Deity it has been said that this narrative is an Elohistic form of the Jehovistic narrative in&#250;<a href="/context/genesis/12-10.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.">Genesis 12:10-20</a>. But we have seen that even in the History of the Fall, where the writer in so remarkable a manner styles the Deity Jehovah-Elohim, he nevertheless restricts Eve and the serpent in their conversation to the name Elohim. With the same care in the application of the names, it is necessarily Elohim who appears to a heathen king; and had the title Jehovah been used it would have been a violation of the narrator's rule. Moreover, the sole reason for calling that narrative Jehovistic is that in <a href="/genesis/12-17.htm" title="And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.">Genesis 12:17</a> it is Jehovah who plagues Pharaoh for Sarah's sake. But equally here, <a href="/genesis/20-18.htm" title="For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.">Genesis 20:18</a>, it is Jehovah who protects Sarah from Abimelech; in both cases it being the covenant- God, who saves his people from injury.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art but a dead man.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">thou diest, </span>or <span class= "ital">art dying. </span>Abimelech was already suffering from the malady spoken of in <a href="/genesis/20-17.htm" title="So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.">Genesis 20:17</a>, when Elohim appeared to him and warned him that death would be the result of perseverance in retaining Sarah. It was this malady which was the cause of the abstention spoken of in <a href="/genesis/20-4.htm" title="But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, will you slay also a righteous nation?">Genesis 20:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/20-6.htm" title="And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; for I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her.">Genesis 20:6</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God</span> - <span class="accented">Elohim</span>; whence the present chapter, with the exception of Ver. 18, is assigned to the Elohist (Tuch, De Wette, Bleek, Davidson), and the incident at Gerar explained as the original legend, of which the story of Sarah's abduction by Pharaoh is the Jehovistic imitation. But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the use of Elohim throughout the present chapter is sufficiently accounted for by observing that it describes the intercourse of Deity with a heathen monarch, to whom the name of Jehovah was unknown, while the employment of the latter term in Ver. 18 may be ascribed to the fact that it is the covenant God of Sarah who there interposes for her protection; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the apparent resemblance between the two incidents is more than counterbalanced by the points of diversity which subsist between them - <span class="cmt_word">came to Abimelech in a dream</span> - the usual mode of self-revelation employed by Elohim towards heathen.
