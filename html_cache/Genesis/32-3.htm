This action demonstrates Jacob's desire to reconcile and prepare the way for his return to Canaan. The use of messengers is consistent with ancient Near Eastern practices where envoys were often sent to negotiate peace or deliver messages between parties.<p><b>to his brother Esau</b><br>The mention of Esau is significant, as it recalls the earlier conflict between the two brothers over the birthright and blessing (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34, 27</a>:1-41). Jacob's fear of Esau's wrath is rooted in their past, where Jacob deceived Isaac to receive the blessing meant for Esau. This encounter is pivotal for Jacob, as it represents a moment of potential reconciliation and the resolution of long-standing familial tension.<p><b>in the land of Seir</b><br>Seir is a mountainous region located southeast of the Dead Sea. It is historically associated with the descendants of Esau, known as the Edomites. The geographical reference to Seir underscores the separation between Jacob and Esau, both physically and relationally, since Jacob had been living in Haran. The land of Seir is later mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>, where God instructs the Israelites not to provoke the Edomites, acknowledging their kinship through Esau.<p><b>the country of Edom</b><br>Edom, derived from the Hebrew word for "red," is linked to Esau, who was described as red and hairy at birth (<a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>). The Edomites, descendants of Esau, became a distinct nation with their own territory. The mention of Edom highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to make Esau a great nation (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Throughout the Bible, Edom is often portrayed as both a relative and rival to Israel, with prophecies concerning Edom found in books like Obadiah and Isaiah, reflecting the complex relationship between the two nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Esau.

Having just seen God&#8217;s angels (<a href="/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1-2</a>), he acts in faith yet with practical wisdom. Scripture often shows God&#8217;s people moving forward while relying on divine promises&#8212;think of Nehemiah requesting the king&#8217;s permission (<a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4-8</a>) or Paul planning missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10</a>). Likewise, Jacob lives out the word already given to him: &#8220;Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>). His initiative demonstrates confidence that the Lord who commands also provides (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>messengers</b><p>The Hebrew term for &#8220;messengers&#8221; is the same used for &#8220;angels,&#8221; yet the context shows these are human envoys. God had just sent heavenly messengers; now Jacob sends earthly ones. This pattern&#8212;God acts, then His servant responds&#8212;is echoed when Moses dispatches spokespersons to Edom (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-17</a>) and when Jesus commissions the seventy-two (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>). By sending messengers, Jacob pursues reconciliation rather than retaliation, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>: &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ahead of him</b><p>Jacob does not rush blindly; he sends others &#8220;ahead of him.&#8221; This mirrors Abraham&#8217;s servant going ahead to find Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2-4</a>) and later Joshua&#8217;s spies scouting Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>). Strategic planning does not contradict faith; it expresses stewardship. Jacob&#8217;s care for his family reflects <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>&#8212;providing protection as well as provision. He moves forward, but only after gathering information and preparing his household (<a href="/genesis/32-7.htm">Genesis 32:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his brother Esau</b><p>The phrase reminds us that the conflict is familial, not merely political. Years earlier Esau vowed to kill Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>), yet God had promised, &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>). By naming Esau as &#8220;brother,&#8221; the text highlights Jacob&#8217;s desire to restore relationship, foreshadowing their tearful embrace (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>). <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a> captures the principle: &#8220;If it is possible&#8230;live at peace with everyone.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Seir</b><p>Esau has left Canaan and settled in mountainous Seir (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>). Jacob&#8217;s message crosses regional borders, showing that God&#8217;s covenant purposes extend beyond one locale. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a> records God commanding Israel to respect Esau&#8217;s territory, underscoring that Seir is legitimately Esau&#8217;s inheritance. By naming the place, the verse stresses the reality of God&#8217;s earlier blessing on Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-39.htm">Genesis 27:39-40</a>) even while affirming Jacob&#8217;s priority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the country of Edom</b><p>&#8220;Edom&#8221; is Esau&#8217;s nation (<a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>). The line will become both neighbor and rival to Israel (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>), yet here the focus is reconciliation. Identifying Edom reminds readers that God&#8217;s promises to Abraham father multiple peoples (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-6</a>). Jacob&#8217;s outreach anticipates later commands to Israel: &#8220;Do not despise an Edomite, for he is your brother&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>). The verse therefore sets a template for how God&#8217;s people relate to kin who live outside the covenant line&#8212;seeking peace while trusting God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a> portrays a decisive, faith-filled step toward reconciliation. Jacob acts on God&#8217;s promises, employs wise preparation, acknowledges Esau as brother, and respects the territory God allotted to Esau. The verse models responsible initiative under divine guidance, showing that believers can&#8212;and should&#8212;pursue peace confidently, trusting the Lord who directs both hearts and histories.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">JACOB'S RECONCILIATION WITH ESAU.</span><p>(<a href="/genesis/32-3.htm" title="And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.">Genesis 32:3</a> to <a href="/genesis/33-16.htm" title="So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.">Genesis 33:16</a>.)<p>(3) <span class= "bld">Jacob sent messengers.</span>--As Jacob travelled homewards to Hebron the news somehow reached him that Esau, at the head of a large body of retainers, was engaged in an expedition against the Horites. These, as we have seen on <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm" title="And the Horites in their mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.">Genesis 14:6</a>, were a miserable race of cave-men, utterly unable to cope with Esau and his trained servants. We learn from <a href="/genesis/36-6.htm" title="And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.">Genesis 36:6</a> that Esau's home was still with Isaac at Hebron, and probably this was a mere marauding expedition, like that against the people of Gath, which a century later cost Ephraim the lives of so many of his sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm" title="And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle.">1Chronicles 7:21</a>); but it revealed to Esau the weakness of the in habitants, and also that the land was admirably adapted for his favourite pursuit of hunting. He seems also to have taken a Horite wife (<a href="/genesis/36-5.htm" title="And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born to him in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 36:5</a>), and being thus connected with the country, upon Isaac's death he willingly removed into it, and it then became "the country," Heb. <span class= "ital">the field of Edom. </span>Its other name, <span class= "ital">Seir, i.e. </span>rough, hairy, shows that it was then covered with forests, and the term <span class= "ital">field </span>that it was an uncultivated region. It was entirely in the spirit of the adventurous Esau to make this expedition, and on his father's death to prefer this wild land to the peaceful pastures at Hebron, where he was surrounded by powerful tribes of Amorites and Hittites. The land of Seir was a hundred miles distant from Mahanaim, but Esau apparently had been moving up through what were afterwards the countries of Moab and Ammon, and was probably, when Jacob sent his messengers, at no very great distance. At all events, Jacob remained at Mahanaim till his brother was near, when he crossed the brook Jabbok, and went to meet him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob sent messengers</span> (with the messengers of Jacob, the messengers of Elohim form a contrast which can scarcely have been accidental) <span class="cmt_word">before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir</span>, - <span class="accented">vide</span> on Genesis 14:6.
