This lineage highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>). Sheba and Dedan are significant as they are often associated with trade and wealth in the biblical narrative. Sheba is later connected with the Queen of Sheba, who visits Solomon, bringing gifts and testing his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-13</a>). Dedan is frequently mentioned in prophetic texts, often in the context of judgment or trade (<a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>). These names also appear in genealogies that trace the spread of peoples and nations, indicating their historical and geographical significance in the ancient Near East.<p><b>And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.</b><br>The descendants of Dedan, namely the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites, are less prominently featured in the biblical narrative, but they represent tribes or groups that settled in the Arabian Peninsula. The Asshurites should not be confused with the Assyrians, though the name similarity suggests a possible cultural or linguistic connection. The Letushites and Leummites are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating that they may have been smaller or less influential groups. However, their inclusion in this genealogy underscores the widespread influence of Abraham's descendants and the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham a father of many nations. This passage also reflects the broader theme of God's sovereignty in the establishment and distribution of nations, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jokshan.htm">Jokshan</a></b><br>A son of Abraham and Keturah, mentioned in the genealogies of Genesis.

The verse reads, &#8220;Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan&#8221;. This simple statement does more than record names:<p>&#8226; It shows God already fulfilling His promise to make Abraham &#8220;a father of many nations&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-6</a>). Jokshan&#8217;s offspring form distinct peoples who will eventually spread across Arabia.<p>&#8226; The name Sheba resurfaces throughout Scripture as a wealthy southern Arabian kingdom famous for gold, spices, and international trade. The Queen of Sheba&#8217;s visit to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1-10</a>) showcases that prosperity, echoing earlier prophecies that &#8220;the kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>) and later visions of caravans &#8220;from Sheba&#8221; bringing gold and frankincense (<a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Dedan likewise appears later as a caravan center (<a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>; 38:13), and its merchants trade with Tyre. These later references trace their lineage back to Abraham through Jokshan, underlining that Abraham&#8217;s family would influence world commerce and politics.<p>By noting Sheba and Dedan together, Moses gives readers a preview of how Abraham&#8217;s line branches out&#8212;some settling far south, others staying closer to the northern Arabian trade routes. Every time Sheba or Dedan appears in prophecy or history, we remember that God&#8217;s word in Genesis is literally true and historically rooted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites</b><p>The verse continues: &#8220;And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites&#8221;. Each of these tribes descends from Dedan and ultimately from Abraham:<p>&#8226; Asshurites &#8211; Mentioned only here, they likely occupied territory toward north-central Arabia, bordering the wider region associated with &#8220;Asshur&#8221; (Assyria). Even if Scripture mentions them only briefly, their existence verifies that Abraham&#8217;s reach stretched toward the great empires of the Fertile Crescent (compare <a href="/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>, where Ishmael&#8217;s line also approaches Assyria).<p>&#8226; Letushites &#8211; Another little-known clan, but their inclusion underscores Scripture&#8217;s attention to detail. Their presence testifies that no promise God gives is vague; He names names and records them exactly.<p>&#8226; Leummites &#8211; Similarly obscure besides this listing. Yet Ezekiel&#8217;s later lament over &#8220;Dedan&#8221; and its trading partners (<a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15, 20</a>) hints that these smaller clans joined the larger Dedanite commercial network.<p>Why does the Spirit preserve even the most obscure genealogical facts? Because every tribe matters in the broader story of redemption. Through these offshoots, God populated wilderness regions, established trade arteries, and kept alive the memory of Abraham&#8217;s God among far-flung peoples. Centuries later, Ezekiel prophesies that &#8220;Sheba and Dedan&#8221; will question Gog&#8217;s invasion (<a href="/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>), proving that these tribes endure in the biblical storyline and remain accountable to the covenant-keeping Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a> records more than a list of rarely mentioned names. It displays God&#8217;s faithfulness to Abraham by charting how his descendants multiply into influential Arabian tribes. Sheba becomes a symbol of wealth and homage; Dedan and its offshoots spread commerce and culture across the desert; even the scarcely known Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites testify that every promise is literal and every detail intentional. In one concise verse, Scripture shows that God&#8217;s word is accurate, His promises are unfolding, and every name in Abraham&#8217;s family tree serves His greater redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan.</span>--But Sheba and Dedan are also described as the sons of Raamah, the son of Cush (<a href="/genesis/10-7.htm" title="And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.">Genesis 10:7</a>). We have here proof that these genealogies are to a certain extent geographical, and that whereas these districts at first were peopled by a Hamitic race, they were subsequently conquered by men of the Semitic stock, who claimed Abraham for their ancestor. Most probably, therefore, we ought not to regard Sneba and Dedan as the names here of men. As men they were the sons of Raamah, but when the sons of Jokshan wrested these two countries from the family of Cush, they called them sons of their progenitor, because the dominant portion of the population had sprung from him.
