Egypt, with its Nile River, was a fertile land and often a refuge during famines. This journey foreshadows future events, such as the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt and the Exodus. Egypt represents both a place of refuge and a place of testing for God's people.<p><b>the Egyptians saw</b><br>The Egyptians' observation of Sarai's beauty indicates the cultural practice of assessing newcomers, especially those of high status or potential threat. This reflects the vigilance of ancient societies in protecting their interests and the importance of appearances in social and political interactions.<p><b>that the woman was very beautiful</b><br>Sarai's beauty is emphasized, which plays a crucial role in the unfolding narrative. Her attractiveness leads to her being taken into Pharaoh's house, setting the stage for God's intervention. This incident parallels later biblical stories where beauty leads to significant events, such as Esther's story. It also prefigures the concept of the bride of Christ, where the church is seen as beautiful and chosen by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.

The promise stands even in foreign territory (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Entering Egypt highlights Abram walking by sight at this moment rather than by faith, paralleling later lapses such as <a href="/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1&#8211;2</a> with Abimelech.<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that believers are &#8220;sojourners and strangers&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>), often navigating cultures that do not share covenant values.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Egyptians saw</b><p>&#8226; Public perception quickly becomes the driving tension; fear of others&#8217; opinions can tempt the faithful to compromise (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Abram&#8217;s concern that &#8220;the Egyptians will kill me, but they will let you live&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-12.htm">Genesis 12:12</a>) shows anxiety about human power rather than resting in divine protection, contrasting with <a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3&#8211;4</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores how the world closely observes God&#8217;s people. Later, Pharaoh&#8217;s household &#8220;knew that she was Abram&#8217;s wife&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-18.htm">Genesis 12:18</a>), proving nothing stays hidden (<a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenarios recur: in <a href="/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a> Isaac fears the men of Gerar; in <a href="/genesis/20-11.htm">Genesis 20:11</a> Abram again says, &#8220;Surely there is no fear of God in this place.&#8221; Scripture shows patterns of human weakness so that God&#8217;s faithfulness shines brighter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the woman was very beautiful</b><p>&#8226; Sarah&#8217;s beauty is a factual, God-given trait, acknowledged again decades later when she is about ninety (<a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>). The text presents her attractiveness straightforwardly, affirming physical reality without diminishing spiritual worth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5&#8211;6</a> points to Sarah as an example of inner adornment paired with outward beauty, teaching that true trust in God produces quiet courage.<p>&#8226; Her beauty becomes the arena for testing Abram&#8217;s leadership and faith. Instead of shielding his wife with truth, he resorts to half-truths, echoing <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a> about the Lord&#8217;s delight in integrity.<p>&#8226; Yet God intervenes to protect Sarah, preserving the messianic line&#8212;an early hint of providence later seen in <a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15-20</a> when He safeguards Hebrew infants, and ultimately in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, &#8220;When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14</a> captures a pivotal moment where covenant people step into a foreign context, human fear collides with divine promise, and God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan quietly prevails. Abram&#8217;s entrance into Egypt, the watchful eyes of its people, and Sarah&#8217;s recognized beauty together expose vulnerabilities, yet they also set the stage for God to demonstrate His protective faithfulness. The verse reminds us that even when faith falters, the Lord upholds His promises and guides His people toward the fulfillment of His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14, 15) <span class= "bld">Pharaoh</span> is not the name of a person, but was the title borne by all the Egyptian monarchs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

The term Pharaoh, which continued in use till after the Persian invasion - under the Greek empire the Egyptian rulers were styled Ptolemies - is declared by Josephus to signify "king" ('Ant.,' 8:06, 2), which agrees with the Koptic Pouro (<span class="accented">Piouro</span>; from ouro, to rule, whence <span class="accented">touro</span>, queen), which also means king. Modern Egyptologers, however, in. cline to regard it as corresponding to the Phra of the inscriptions (Rosellini, Lepeius, Wilkinson), or to the hieroglyphic <span class="accented">Peraa</span>, or <span class="accented">Perao</span>, "the great house (M. de Rouge, Brugsch, Ebers), an appellation which belonged to the Egyptian monarchs, and with which may be compared "the Sublime Porte," as applied to the Turkish sultans (cf. Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 47?). The particular monarch who occupied the Egyptian throne at the time of Abram's arrival has been conjectured to be Necao (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5. 9:4), Ramessemenes (Syncellus, p. 101), Pharethones (Euseb., 'Praep. Ev.,' 9:8), Apappus (Wilkinson, 'Anc. Egypt.,' vol. 1. p. 13, note 5, Dr. Bitch's edition), Achthoes, the sixth king of the eleventh dynasty (Osburn, 'Men. Hist. of Egypt,' vol. 1. <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>. p. 375), Salatis or Saitas, the first king of the fifteenth dynasty, whose reign commenced <span class="date">B.C. 2080</span> (Stuart Peele in 'Smith's Dict.,' art. Pharaoh), a monarch belonging to the sixteenth dynasty of shepherd kings (Kalisch), and a Pharaoh who flourished between the middle of the eleventh and thirteenth dynasties, most probably one of the earliest Pharaohs of the twelfth (Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 447). Amid such conflicting testimony from erudite archaeologists it is apparent that nothing can be ascertained with exactitude as to the date of Abram's sojourn in Egypt; though the last-named writer, who exhibits the latest results of scholarship on the question, mentions in support of his conclusion a variety of considerations that may be profitably studied. <span class="cmt_word">Saw her</span>.
