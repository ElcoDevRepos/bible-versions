This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of hospitality and respect towards travelers. The use of "lord" here can also be seen as a recognition of the divine nature of the visitors, as one of them is later revealed to be the Lord Himself. This encounter is significant as it prefigures theophanies, where God appears in human form, which is a type of Christ who is God incarnate.<p><b>&#8220;if I have found favor in your sight,&#8221;</b><br>Abraham's request for favor indicates a humble approach, acknowledging the authority and power of the visitor. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of grace, where favor is granted by God not based on merit but on His sovereign choice. It parallels other instances in Scripture where individuals seek God's favor, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>. The concept of finding favor is central to the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>&#8220;please do not pass your servant by.&#8221;</b><br>Abraham's plea for the visitors to stay reflects the cultural importance of hospitality in the ancient world, where providing for travelers was a sacred duty. This request also underscores Abraham's desire for a deeper encounter with the divine, illustrating the human longing for God's presence. The phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament invitation for Christ to dwell with believers, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, seeking fellowship with those who open to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abraham is a patriarch of the faith, known for his obedience and faithfulness to God.

Abraham's conduct is marked by all that stately courtesy usual among Orientals. He calls himself their slave: regards it as a favour that they should partake of his hospitality; speaks slightingly of the repast prepared as a mere morsel of bread; and treats it as a providential act that they had come into his neighbourhood. It was only afterwards that he knew that he was entertaining angels unawares (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>). While, moreover, he addresses the chief traveller first, as courtesy required, he immediately afterwards changes to the plural, lest he should seem wanting in hospitable welcome to his companions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said, My Lord</span> - Adonai, literally, Lord, as in <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>, q.v.

The readings Adoni, my Lord (A.V., Dathius, Rosenm&uuml;ller), and Aden, my lords (Gesenius), are incorrect - <span class="cmt_word">if now I have found favor in thy sight</span> - not implying dubiety on Abraham s part as to his acceptance before God (Knobel), but rather postulating his already conscious enjoyment of the Divine favor as the ground of the request about to be preferred (Delitzsch, Lange). Those who regard Abraham as unconscious of the Divinity of him to whom he spake see in his language nothing but the customary formula of Oriental address (Rosenm&uuml;ller; cf. <a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>; <a href="/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">put not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.</span> The hospitality of the Eastern, and even of the Arab, has been frequently remarked by travelers. Volney describes the Arab as dining at his tent door in order to invite passers-by ('Tray.,' 1. p. 314). "The virtue of hospitality is one of the great redeeming virtues in the character of the Bedouins (Kalisch). "<span class="accented">Whenever</span> our path led us near an encampment, as was frequently the case, we always found some active sheikh or venerable patriarch sitting 'in his tent door,' and as soon as we were within haft we heard the earnest words of welcome and invitation which the Old Testament Scriptures had rendered long ago familiar to us: Stay, my lord, stay.
