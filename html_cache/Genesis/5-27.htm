This extraordinary age is often seen as a testament to the antediluvian (pre-Flood) world, where lifespans were significantly longer. The long lifespans in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> are sometimes interpreted as literal, while others see them as symbolic or representative of the era's conditions. Methuselah's name is often thought to mean "man of the dart" or "his death shall bring," which some interpret as prophetic, suggesting that his death would coincide with the coming of the Flood. This aligns with the timeline, as Methuselah's death is traditionally understood to have occurred in the same year as the Flood. His long life can be seen as a symbol of God's patience and mercy, delaying judgment to allow for repentance.<p><b>and then he died</b><br>The phrase "and then he died" is a recurring refrain in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, emphasizing the mortality that came as a result of the Fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. Despite the long lifespans, death was inevitable, underscoring the consequences of sin. Methuselah's death marks the end of an era, as he was the last of the patriarchs to die before the Flood. This serves as a reminder of the judgment that was to come and the transition from the antediluvian world to the post-Flood world. The inevitability of death points to the need for redemption, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who conquers death and offers eternal life. Methuselah's life and death can be seen as a type, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance from sin and death through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/methuselah.htm">Methuselah</a></b><br>Methuselah is a significant figure in the genealogies of Genesis.
