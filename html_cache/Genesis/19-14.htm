The term "sons-in-law" indicates that these men were betrothed to Lot's daughters, a binding agreement in ancient Near Eastern culture, akin to marriage. This reflects the seriousness of the situation, as Lot seeks to save not only his immediate family but also those connected through future marriage. The urgency of Lot's message underscores the impending judgment on Sodom, a city known for its wickedness (<a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>). The cultural practice of betrothal highlights the importance of family ties and responsibilities in ancient times.<p><b>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!&#8221;</b><br>Lot's command to "Get up" signifies the immediate need for action. The phrase "Get out of this place" is a direct warning of the impending divine judgment. The use of "the LORD" indicates that Lot is aware of the divine source of the warning, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. This reflects the biblical theme of God's judgment on sin, as seen in other instances such as the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>. The destruction of Sodom serves as a foreshadowing of future judgments and a call to repentance, highlighting God's righteousness and the consequences of sin.<p><b>But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</b><br>The reaction of Lot's sons-in-law reveals a lack of belief and understanding of the gravity of the situation. Their perception of Lot's warning as a joke illustrates the spiritual blindness and moral decay prevalent in Sodom. This mirrors the attitude of many in the face of prophetic warnings throughout scripture, such as in the days of Noah (<a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>). The disbelief of the sons-in-law serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ignoring divine warnings and the importance of taking God's word seriously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, living in Sodom, a city known for its wickedness.

His immediate movement shows genuine faith expressed through action, echoing <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a> where Noah &#8220;in holy fear built an ark to save his family.&#8221; Like Noah, Lot acts on God&#8217;s warning before judgment falls. His going &#8220;out&#8221; prefigures the call for believers to separate from the world&#8217;s corruption (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spoke to the sons-in-law who were pledged in marriage to his daughters.</b><p>Lot&#8217;s concern extends beyond himself; he wants to rescue his future family members. Compare this with <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a> where salvation is promised &#8220;you and your household,&#8221; highlighting God&#8217;s desire to spare families through believing relatives. Yet these men, though outwardly connected to Lot, do not share his faith. Their pledged status underscores that proximity to believers does not equal personal commitment to God (<a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; he said.</b><p>The imperative is urgent. Similar commands appear in <a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a> when Pharaoh tells Moses, &#8220;Rise up&#8230; go.&#8221; God&#8217;s calls are often sudden and require immediate obedience (<a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>). Lot&#8217;s concise warning strips away excuses and underscores that spiritual lethargy in a crisis is deadly (<a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!&#8221;</b><p>Lot&#8217;s message is clear: judgment is imminent and divine. Like Jonah&#8217;s proclamation over Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>), it leaves room for response but not negotiation. His reliance on &#8220;the LORD&#8221; (YHWH) roots the warning in God&#8217;s authority, not personal opinion. This reflects <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>: &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221; The certainty of destruction underlines that God&#8217;s patience has limits (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</b><p>Their reaction mirrors the scoffers of <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3&#8211;4</a> who doubt promised judgment. It also recalls the mockery faced by Noah (implied in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9&#8211;22</a>) and later by Christ (<a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>). Disbelief turns a gracious warning into an object of ridicule, sealing their fate. This disbelief fulfills <a href="/proverbs/14-9.htm">Proverbs 14:9</a>, &#8220;Fools mock at making amends for sin,&#8221; exposing hardened hearts that resist repentance even when salvation is offered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a> reveals the clash between urgent faith and casual unbelief. Lot acts promptly on God&#8217;s word, urging those he loves to flee imminent judgment. His sons-in-law, comfortable and unconvinced, dismiss the warning as a joke, illustrating that mere association with the godly cannot save. The verse challenges every reader to heed God&#8217;s calls without delay, trusting His word as literally true and eternally consequential.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Which married his daughters.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the takers of his daughters</span>--a present participle, for which reason Ewald, Tuch, and others translate "who were to marry his daughters."
