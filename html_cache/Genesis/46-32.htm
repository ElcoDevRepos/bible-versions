This cultural context is significant because it sets the stage for the Israelites' separation in the land of Goshen, where they could maintain their distinct identity. Shepherding was a common occupation among the patriarchs, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it symbolizes leadership and care, qualities later attributed to Jesus Christ, the "Good Shepherd" (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>they raise livestock,</b><br>Raising livestock was a primary occupation for the Israelites, reflecting their nomadic heritage. This phrase emphasizes their skills and expertise in animal husbandry, which was crucial for their survival and prosperity. The ability to raise livestock also signifies God's provision and blessing, as seen in the wealth of Abraham and Job, who were both blessed with large flocks and herds (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>, <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>).<p><b>and they have brought their flocks and herds</b><br>The mention of flocks and herds indicates the wealth and resources the Israelites brought with them to Egypt. This movement of livestock also fulfills God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be numerous and prosperous (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The presence of these animals in Egypt foreshadows the eventual Exodus, where the Israelites would leave with even greater wealth (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>).<p><b>and all that they own.</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the Israelites' migration to Egypt, bringing everything they possessed. It highlights their trust in God's plan and provision, as they left nothing behind. This complete relocation is reminiscent of Abraham's initial call to leave his homeland and go to a land God would show him (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). It also prefigures the future Exodus, where the Israelites would again take all their possessions as they departed Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is moving his family to Egypt during a time of famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's son, who has risen to a position of power in Egypt and is facilitating his family's relocation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who has granted permission for Joseph's family to settle in the land of Goshen.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/goshen.htm">Goshen</a></b><br>The region in Egypt where Joseph's family is to settle, known for its fertile land suitable for grazing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>The occupation of Jacob's family, which is significant in the context of Egyptian society, where shepherds were often looked down upon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_guidance.htm">God's Provision and Guidance</a></b><br>Just as God provided for Jacob's family during a time of famine, He continues to provide for His people today.
