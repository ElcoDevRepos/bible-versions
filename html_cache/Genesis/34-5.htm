This event takes place in the land of Canaan, where Jacob had settled after returning from Paddan Aram. The defilement of Dinah is a significant event, as it not only affects Jacob's family but also has broader implications for the relationship between Jacob's family and the inhabitants of the land. The act of defilement is seen as a grave sin, violating the sanctity of Dinah and the honor of Jacob's family. This incident foreshadows the tension and conflict that will arise between the Israelites and the Canaanites, highlighting the moral and cultural differences between them.<p><b>but since his sons were with his livestock in the field</b><br>Jacob's sons, who would later become the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel, are occupied with tending to the family's livestock. This detail underscores the pastoral lifestyle of the patriarchs, who were primarily shepherds and herdsmen. The mention of the sons being in the field indicates their responsibility and involvement in the family's economic activities. It also sets the stage for their reaction to the news of Dinah's defilement, as they are not immediately present to respond to the situation. The pastoral setting reflects the nomadic nature of Jacob's family and their dependence on livestock for sustenance and wealth.<p><b>he remained silent about it until they returned</b><br>Jacob's silence can be interpreted in several ways. It may indicate his shock and grief over the incident, as well as his cautious nature in dealing with such a sensitive matter. His decision to wait for his sons' return suggests the importance of family unity and collective decision-making in addressing the crisis. This silence also highlights Jacob's role as a patriarch who must balance his emotions with the need for wise leadership. The delay in response allows for the development of a plan, which ultimately leads to the subsequent actions taken by his sons. Jacob's silence is a moment of tension, reflecting the gravity of the situation and the potential for conflict.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, father of Dinah, and a central figure in this account.
