His identity as the "lord of the land" highlights the fulfillment of his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) where his brothers would bow to him. This authority was granted to Joseph by Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-44</a>) and is a type of Christ, who is given all authority in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>&#8216;This is how I will know whether you are honest:</b><br>Joseph's test of his brothers' honesty is significant in the narrative. It serves as a means to discern their character and repentance for their past actions against him. This mirrors the testing of faith seen throughout Scripture, such as in the story of Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1-19</a>), where God tests Abraham's faithfulness.<p><b>Leave one brother with me,</b><br>Joseph's demand to leave one brother behind is a strategic move to ensure the return of the others. It echoes the earlier situation where Joseph himself was separated from his brothers, sold into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>). This separation serves as a test of the brothers' loyalty and integrity, and it foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and restoration of the family.<p><b>take food to relieve the hunger of your households,</b><br>The provision of food underscores the severity of the famine affecting the region, which was foretold in Pharaoh's dreams and interpreted by Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-32</a>). This act of providing sustenance is a demonstration of Joseph's mercy and wisdom, reflecting God's provision for His people, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>and go.</b><br>The instruction to "go" signifies a temporary release, allowing the brothers to return to their father, Jacob, with the necessary provisions. This departure sets the stage for the unfolding of God's plan for the family of Israel, ultimately leading to their migration to Egypt and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is testing his brothers to see if they have changed since they sold him into slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>- The sons of Jacob who have come to Egypt to buy grain during the famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>- The land where Joseph has risen to power and where his brothers have come to seek food.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>- A severe shortage of food affecting the region, prompting Joseph's brothers to travel to Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>- The father of Joseph and his brothers, who remains in Canaan while his sons go to Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_and_honesty.htm">Integrity and Honesty</a></b><br>Joseph's test is designed to reveal the integrity of his brothers.
