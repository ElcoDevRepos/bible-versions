In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, wives and children were often considered part of a man's wealth and household. Jacob's request emphasizes his rightful claim to his family, which he acquired through his labor. This reflects the patriarchal structure of the time, where family units were central to one's identity and legacy.<p><b>for whom I have served you</b><br>Jacob's service to Laban lasted 14 years, initially for Rachel, whom he loved, but he was deceived into marrying Leah first. This phrase highlights the theme of servitude and the fulfillment of obligations, which is a recurring theme in Jacob's life. It also underscores the idea of working for what one desires, a principle seen throughout the Bible, such as in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>that I may go on my way</b><br>Jacob's desire to leave Laban and return to his homeland is significant. It reflects the biblical theme of pilgrimage and the journey of faith, akin to Abraham's call to leave his country (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the Exodus, where the Israelites seek to leave Egypt and return to the Promised Land.<p><b>You know how hard I have worked for you.</b><br>Jacob's hard work is a testament to his character and perseverance. This phrase can be connected to the biblical principle of diligence and integrity in labor, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>, "All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty." It also highlights the tension between Jacob and Laban, setting the stage for Jacob's eventual departure and God's continued faithfulness to him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jacob is seeking to leave Laban's household with his family.
