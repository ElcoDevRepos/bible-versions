Machpelah is traditionally located near Hebron, a significant city in the biblical narrative. The mention of Mamre connects this location to earlier events in Genesis, such as Abraham's meeting with the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. The field's owner, Ephron, is a Hittite, indicating the presence of various peoples in Canaan during this period. This transaction marks the first piece of the Promised Land that Abraham legally owns, symbolizing the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to his descendants.<p><b>the cave that was in it</b><br>The cave of Machpelah becomes the burial site for Sarah, Abraham, and later other patriarchs and matriarchs, including Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob. This cave holds significant historical and spiritual importance as a family burial site, emphasizing the patriarchs' faith in God's promises. The cave's purchase signifies a permanent claim to the land, contrasting with Abraham's previous nomadic lifestyle.<p><b>and all the trees within the boundaries of the field</b><br>The inclusion of trees in the transaction highlights the comprehensive nature of the purchase. Trees were valuable resources in ancient times, providing wood, shade, and possibly fruit. The detailed description of the property boundaries underscores the legal and formal nature of the transaction, ensuring that there is no dispute over ownership. This attention to detail reflects the customs and legal practices of the time, emphasizing the legitimacy of Abraham's claim.<p><b>were deeded over</b><br>The phrase indicates a formal transfer of ownership, suggesting a legal transaction recognized by the community. This deed is significant as it represents the first legal acquisition of land in Canaan by Abraham, a tangible step towards the fulfillment of God's covenant. The act of deeding over the land also prefigures the future inheritance of the Promised Land by Abraham's descendants, serving as a type of the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephron.htm">Ephron</a></b><br>A Hittite landowner who sold the field and cave to Abraham.

The old Christian tradition, which places it at Ramet-el-Chalil, does not agree with this description, and is, moreover, too far away. The remains pointed out there as those of Abraham's house, are the ruins of a heathen temple. But it is useless to look for any remains of the abode of a nomad dwelling in tents, especially after the site has been occupied by a great city. Moreover, Hebron itself has changed its position.
