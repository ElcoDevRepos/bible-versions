The mention of "wives" and "sons and daughters" reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding numerous descendants. Esau's household would have included not only his immediate family but also servants and possibly other relatives, emphasizing the wealth and influence he had accumulated. This movement of an entire household is reminiscent of Abraham's journey from Ur, suggesting a continuation of the patriarchal tradition of migration.<p><b>along with his livestock, all his other animals, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan</b><br>Esau's wealth is underscored by the mention of livestock and property, which were primary indicators of wealth in ancient times. The reference to "Canaan" is significant as it was the land promised to Abraham's descendants. Esau's acquisition of property there shows his initial establishment in the land, despite the eventual separation from it. This separation from Canaan can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah that the older would serve the younger (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), as Esau moves away from the land of promise.<p><b>and he moved to a land far away from his brother Jacob</b><br>Esau's decision to move "far away" from Jacob is both practical and symbolic. Practically, it addresses the issue of resources, as the land could not support both brothers' growing wealth (<a href="/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a>). Symbolically, it represents the divergence of the two brothers' destinies. Esau's move to Seir (later known as Edom) fulfills the earlier prophecy of separation and distinct nations arising from the two brothers. This separation also prefigures the later enmity between Israel (descendants of Jacob) and Edom (descendants of Esau), as seen in passages like <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Jacob.
