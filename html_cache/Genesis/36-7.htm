Their possessions, primarily livestock, were so abundant that they could not coexist in the same area. This situation mirrors the earlier separation of Abraham and Lot in <a href="/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a>, where their wealth also necessitated a division. The prosperity of both brothers can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to their grandfather Abraham, indicating divine blessing. The inability to dwell together due to wealth underscores the challenges that material abundance can bring, even among family members.<p><b>the land where they stayed could not support them</b><br>The land referred to here is the region of Canaan, which was not only the Promised Land but also a land with limited resources. The agricultural and pastoral capacity of the land was insufficient to sustain the large herds and flocks of both Esau and Jacob. This reflects the historical and geographical reality of ancient Canaan, a land with variable rainfall and limited arable land. The scarcity of resources often led to conflicts and migrations, as seen throughout biblical history.<p><b>because of their livestock.</b><br>Livestock was a primary measure of wealth and status in the ancient Near East. The mention of livestock emphasizes the pastoral lifestyle of the patriarchs and the economic basis of their wealth. This detail connects to the broader biblical narrative where livestock often symbolizes God's blessing and provision (e.g., <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>). The abundance of livestock also foreshadows the future prosperity of Israel, as promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The need to separate due to livestock abundance highlights the practical challenges of managing God's blessings responsibly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The brother of Jacob, also known as Edom.

Verse 7 opens by telling us those combined assets were &#8220;too great.&#8221; Scripture often highlights how God&#8217;s material blessing can become so abundant that it reshapes living arrangements (<a href="/genesis/26-13.htm">Genesis 26:13&#8211;14</a> with Isaac; <a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a> with Jacob). Here, the text underscores sheer volume:<p>&#8226; Countless animals requiring pasture and water<p>&#8226; Servants, tents, and supplies expanding daily<p>&#8226; Two large family camps now matching or exceeding the scale once seen in Abram&#8217;s day (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for them to dwell together</b><p>The implication is straightforward: the brothers could not occupy the same space without strain. Earlier tension between Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>) had already pushed them toward physical distance, yet the narrator stresses practical necessity rather than personal bitterness. The pattern echoes Abram and Lot: &#8220;the land could not support them while they stayed together&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a>). Separation preserved peace and prevented the sort of strife <a href="/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a> describes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the land where they stayed</b><p>At this moment Jacob is settling in Canaan while Esau gravitates toward Seir (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>). Canaan&#8217;s central hill country offers limited grazing and water; overgrazing would quickly exhaust it. Unlike Egypt&#8217;s irrigated Nile valley (cf. <a href="/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>), Canaan relies on seasonal rains (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11-12</a>). The verse reminds readers that earthly territories have God-set limits, no matter how rich His people become (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>could not support them</b><p>Support means sustain life&#8212;ample grass, water, and space for breeding. When population pressure rises, wisdom dictates relocation (<a href="/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10-11</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-18</a>). By leaving, Esau avoids conflict and ensures both families thrive. The principle surfaces throughout Scripture: when resources stretch thin, God often opens a new place (<a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1-4</a>; <a href="/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of their livestock</b><p>Livestock is the engine of their wealth (<a href="/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10-12</a>). Large herds consume:<p>&#8226; Pasture&#8212;overgrazed fields turn to dust<p>&#8226; Water&#8212;wells are finite (<a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18-22</a>)<p>&#8226; Labor&#8212;shepherds need distance to manage flocks (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>)<p>Their animals, gifts from God (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>), are also responsibilities (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-27</a>). Stewardship sometimes means moving on so God&#8217;s provision is not squandered. Esau&#8217;s choice to settle in Seir honors that stewardship and fulfills earlier prophecies about his territory (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a> records a practical, literal reason for Esau&#8217;s departure: God had blessed both brothers so richly that remaining side by side in the same stretch of Canaan would have damaged the land and stirred conflict. Their enormous herds demanded separate territories, echoing Abram and Lot&#8217;s earlier division. The verse reminds us that divine blessing brings responsibility, that land and resources have limits, and that wise, peace-loving stewardship sometimes requires a gracious parting of ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The land wherein they were strangers.</span>--The large growth of their wealth made the separation of Esau and Jacob as inevitable as had been that of Abraham and Lot. It is a usual incident in the life of nomads, and a tribe can multiply only to the extent of the capabilities of their district to support them. When this is reached, one portion of the tribe must seek a new home. This necessity was in the present case aggravated by Esau and Jacob being only sojourners in Canaan, surrounded by tribes who claimed to be owners of the soil: and this may have helped in determining Esau's choice; for in right of Aholibamah, he was in her country a duke. Maimonides also observes, that though Esau had gone on hunting expeditions to Seir, and even possibly for plunder, yet that he was not sufficiently powerful to take possession of the country until by Isaac's death the number of his retainers was largely multiplied.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers</span> - literally, <span class="accented">of their wanderings</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/28-4.htm">Genesis 28:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-1.htm">Genesis 37:1</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">could not bear them because of their cattle</span>. This does not necessarily imply that Jacob was established in Canaan before Esau removed. Esau may have recognized the impossibility of two so rich and powerful chieftains as himself and his brother occupying Canaan, and may have retired Before Jacob actually took possession (Keil, Inglis). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/36-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their possessions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
