Throughout Joseph's life, God's presence is a recurring theme, seen earlier in <a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a> when Joseph was successful in Potiphar's house. This reflects the covenantal promise God made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ensuring His presence with their descendants. It also prefigures the New Testament promise of God's presence with believers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, where Jesus assures His followers, "I am with you always."<p><b>and extended kindness to him</b><br>The Hebrew word for "kindness" here is "chesed," often translated as loving-kindness or steadfast love. This term is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe God's covenantal love and mercy. In Joseph's context, it signifies God's active role in providing for and protecting him, even in prison. This kindness is a precursor to the grace extended through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's ultimate act of kindness and mercy.<p><b>granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden</b><br>Joseph's favor with the prison warden mirrors his earlier favor with Potiphar, indicating a divine orchestration of events. This favor is reminiscent of Daniel's experience in Babylon, where God granted him favor with the authorities (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>). It highlights a biblical principle that God can influence the hearts of leaders and authorities, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states, "The king&#8217;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He will." This favor also foreshadows the favor Jesus found with God and man, as mentioned in <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man sold into slavery by his brothers, who rose to prominence in Potiphar's house before being falsely accused and imprisoned.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who remains faithful to His promises and is actively involved in Joseph's life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prison_warden.htm">The Prison Warden</a></b><br>The official in charge of the prison where Joseph was held, who recognized Joseph's integrity and leadership abilities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prison.htm">The Prison</a></b><br>The place where Joseph was confined after being falsely accused by Potiphar's wife, yet where he continued to experience God's favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/potiphar's_house.htm">Potiphar's House</a></b><br>The initial place of Joseph's servitude in Egypt, where he was entrusted with great responsibility before his imprisonment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_adversity.htm">God's Presence in Adversity</a></b><br>Even in the darkest circumstances, God is with His people, providing comfort and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor_and_human_responsibility.htm">Divine Favor and Human Responsibility</a></b><br>While God grants favor, Joseph's integrity and diligence play a role in his success and influence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_trials.htm">Faithfulness in Trials</a></b><br>Joseph's account encourages believers to remain faithful and trust in God's plan, even when facing unjust situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_timing.htm">God's Sovereignty and Timing</a></b><br>God's purposes are fulfilled in His timing, often using trials to prepare and position His people for future roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_through_conduct.htm">Witness Through Conduct</a></b><br>Joseph's behavior in prison serves as a testimony to God's work in his life, impacting those around him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_39_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 39:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/God_s_presence_in_tough_times.htm">How does God's presence in Genesis 39:21 encourage you in difficult situations?
