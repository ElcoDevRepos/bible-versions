This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice where kings would issue decrees to maintain order and protect individuals under their jurisdiction. The Philistines, residing in the region of Gerar, were known for their interactions with the patriarchs, as seen in earlier encounters with Abraham. This warning underscores the respect and fear Isaac commanded, possibly due to his growing wealth and influence, which God had blessed him with.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Whoever harms this man or his wife</b><br>The decree specifically mentions both Isaac and Rebekah, highlighting the importance of family and marital relationships in biblical narratives. This protection echoes earlier divine interventions, such as when God protected Sarah in Egypt and Gerar. The emphasis on harm reflects the potential for conflict and the need for divine and royal intervention to ensure the safety of God's chosen people. This also prefigures the protective nature of God over His covenant people throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>will surely be put to death.&#8221;</b><br>The death penalty for harming Isaac or Rebekah indicates the severity of the decree and the high regard in which they were held. This reflects the ancient legal systems where the protection of certain individuals was paramount, and severe consequences were imposed to deter wrongdoing. The phrase "surely be put to death" is reminiscent of covenant language, where breaking a covenant often resulted in severe penalties. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where ultimate protection and deliverance are assured for those under God's covenant, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice and protection offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The king of the Philistines in Gerar, who interacts with Isaac.

The king has just discovered the truth. &#8220;So&#8221; signals a decisive response built on that discovery (<a href="/genesis/26-9.htm">Genesis 26:9&#8211;10</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3-7</a>, a similar scene with Abraham).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that God often turns human failures into occasions for His protective grace (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abimelech warned all the people</b><p>&#8226; The Philistine ruler steps in as the God-ordained authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>) to safeguard Isaac and Rebekah.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Lord had already promised, &#8220;I will be with you and bless you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>). Abimelech&#8217;s public decree becomes the means by which that promise is kept.<p>&#8226; Like Pharaoh&#8217;s later edict to preserve Joseph&#8217;s family (<a href="/genesis/45-19.htm">Genesis 45:19-20</a>), this royal order advances God&#8217;s covenant plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; Abimelech doesn&#8217;t merely draft a private note; he speaks out loud, making the protection of Isaac and Rebekah a matter of public record (<a href="/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Public proclamation eliminates ambiguity and spreads accountability among &#8220;all the people&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-13.htm">Deuteronomy 17:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever harms this man or his wife</b><p>&#8226; The phrase widens the shield to include both Isaac and Rebekah, echoing God&#8217;s covenant promise: &#8220;I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; 27:29).<p>&#8226; It underscores the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>) and the personal nature of God&#8217;s protection over His chosen family (<a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will surely be put to death</b><p>&#8226; Abimelech imposes the severest penalty, aligning with the biblical principle that life is sacred and protected by capital punishment when necessary (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording reflects moral seriousness: no lesser fine or slap on the wrist will do.

Linking to earlier divine promises, Abimelech&#8217;s public threat of capital punishment becomes the Lord&#8217;s immediate shield for Isaac and Rebekah. The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness, the protective role of governing authorities, and the value He places on marriage and human life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abimelech charged all his</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">people, saying, He that toucheth - in the sense of injureth</span> (cf. <a href="/joshua/9-19.htm">Joshua 9:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</span> The similarity of this incident to that related in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a>. concerning Abraham in Gerar may be explained without resorting to the hypothesis of different authors, The stereotyped character of the manners of antiquity, especially in the East, is sufficient to account for the danger to which Sarah was exposed recurring in the case of Rebekah three quarters of a century later. That Isaac should have resorted to the miserable expedient of his father may have been due simply to a lack of originality on the part of Isaac; or perhaps the recollection of the success which had attended his father's adoption of this wretched subterfuge may have blinded him to its true character. But from whatever cause resulting, the resemblance between the two narratives cannot be held as destroying the credibility of either, and all the more that a careful scrutiny will detect sufficient dissimilarity between them to establish the authenticity of the incidents which they relate. <p> CHAPTER 26:12-22 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/26-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Abimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_40.htm">Strong's 40: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abimelech -- 'father is king', a Philistine name, also an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">warned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1443;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;aw)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
