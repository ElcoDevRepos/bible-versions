The tree, specifically the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, was placed in the Garden of Eden by God with a command not to eat from it (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). The woman's perception of the tree as "good for food" suggests a shift from divine instruction to human judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the struggle between following God's commands and human desires, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which warns that there is a way that seems right to a person but leads to death.<p><b>and pleasing to the eyes</b><br>The appeal to the eyes underscores the seductive nature of sin, which often appears attractive and desirable. This mirrors the temptation of materialism and superficial beauty found throughout scripture, such as in 1 <a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>, which speaks of the lust of the eyes. The visual allure of the forbidden fruit is a reminder of the deceptive nature of sin, which can mask its true consequences.<p><b>and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom</b><br>The desire for wisdom reflects a deeper temptation: the aspiration to be like God, knowing good and evil. This echoes the serpent's earlier deception in <a href="/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>, where he suggests that eating the fruit would make them like God. The pursuit of wisdom apart from God is a recurring theme in the Bible, contrasting with the fear of the Lord as the beginning of true wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>she took the fruit and ate it</b><br>This act of disobedience marks the first sin, often referred to as "The Fall." It represents a deliberate choice to go against God's command, introducing sin and death into the world (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The act of taking and eating the fruit symbolizes the human tendency to prioritize personal desire over divine will, a theme that recurs throughout biblical history.<p><b>She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it</b><br>This phrase indicates Adam's complicity in the sin. Although Eve is the one who initially takes the fruit, Adam's participation signifies a shared responsibility. The fact that he was "with her" suggests that he was present during the temptation and failed to intervene, highlighting themes of leadership and accountability. This act of disobedience by both Adam and Eve sets the stage for the need for redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "second Adam" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>), bringing life where the first Adam brought death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Eve)</a></b><br>The first woman created by God, who is tempted by the serpent and chooses to eat the forbidden fruit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil.htm">The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></b><br>The specific tree in the Garden of Eden from which God commanded Adam and Eve not to eat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fruit.htm">The Fruit</a></b><br>The object of temptation, representing disobedience to God's command.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_husband.htm">The Husband (Adam)</a></b><br>The first man created by God, who also eats the fruit after Eve gives it to him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The perfect place created by God for Adam and Eve, where they lived before the Fall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_temptation.htm">The Nature of Temptation</a></b><br>Temptation often appeals to our senses and desires, as seen in Eve's attraction to the fruit's appearance and perceived benefits.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God's commands leads to separation from Him and has far-reaching consequences, as demonstrated by the Fall.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_personal_responsibility.htm">The Role of Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Both Adam and Eve made individual choices to disobey God, highlighting the importance of personal responsibility in our spiritual lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_word.htm">The Importance of God's Word</a></b><br>Knowing and adhering to God's Word is crucial in resisting temptation, as Eve's failure to do so led to sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_influence.htm">The Impact of Influence</a></b><br>Eve's decision influenced Adam, reminding us of the power of our actions and decisions on others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_3_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 3:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_3_6_Disobedience_consequences.htm">How does Genesis 3:6 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God's commands?

Eve&#8217;s sensory delight, intellectual rationalization, and final act of disobedience reveal the anatomy of sin: seeing, coveting, taking, and sharing. Adam&#8217;s silent complicity underscores personal responsibility and the devastating reach of sin. The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s word above our perceptions, resist visually and intellectually enticing temptations, and remember that true wisdom&#8212;and life&#8212;come only through obedient fellowship with the Creator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And when the woman saw . . . she took.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">And the woman saw </span>. . . <span class= "ital">and she took, </span>&c. In this, the original form of the narrative, we see the progress of the temptation detailed in a far more lively manner than in our version. With awakened desire the woman gazes upon the tree. The fruit appears inviting to the eye, and possibly was really good for food. The whole aspect of the tree was beautiful; and, besides, there was the promise held out to her that it possessed the mysterious faculty of developing her intellectual powers. To this combined influence of her senses without and her ambition within she was unable to offer that resistance which would have been possible only by a living faith in the spoken word of God. She eats, therefore, and gives to her husband--so called here for the first time--and he eats with her. The demeanour of Adam throughout is extraordinary. It is the woman who is tempted--not as though Adam was not present, as Milton supposes, for she has not to seek him--but he shares with her at once the gathered fruit. Rather, she is pictured to us as more quick and observant, more open to impressions, more curious and full of longings than the man, whose passive behaviour is as striking as the woman's eagerness and excitability.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (when) <span class="cmt_word">the woman saw</span>.
