Abraham's household included not only his immediate family but also a large number of servants and workers. This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where a household could be quite extensive. The inclusion of all men in the household signifies the communal aspect of God's covenant with Abraham, extending beyond biological descendants to all who are part of his household.<p><b>both servants born in his household and those purchased from foreigners&#8212;</b><br>This highlights the inclusivity of the covenant, extending to both native-born servants and those acquired from outside Abraham's immediate ethnic group. In the ancient world, slavery and servitude were common, and households often included individuals from various backgrounds. The mention of "purchased from foreigners" underscores the idea that God's covenant with Abraham was not limited by ethnicity or origin, prefiguring the later inclusion of Gentiles into the faith community as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>were circumcised with him.</b><br>Circumcision served as a physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham, as established earlier in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>. It was a mark of identity and belonging to God's chosen people. The act of circumcision for all males in Abraham's household symbolizes obedience and submission to God's commands. This prefigures the New Testament concept of spiritual circumcision, where the focus is on the heart and faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>). The communal circumcision also points to the unity and collective identity of God's people, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who received God's covenant and was commanded to circumcise all males in his household as a sign of this covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>Abraham's son with Hagar, who was also circumcised as part of the covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_servants.htm">Household Servants</a></b><br>These include both those born in Abraham's household and those purchased from foreigners, indicating the inclusivity of the covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_of_circumcision.htm">Covenant of Circumcision</a></b><br>A significant event where God established circumcision as a physical sign of His covenant with Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>The region where Abraham was residing at the time, a place of significant biblical events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Abraham's immediate compliance with God's command to circumcise all males in his household demonstrates his obedience and faith.

This shows the total obedience of Abraham&#8217;s sphere of influence, reflecting God&#8217;s earlier directive in verse 12. Similar household obedience appears later when Joshua declares, &#8220;as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). The verse insists that no male attached to Abraham remained outside the covenant sign, underscoring the seriousness of God&#8217;s command in <a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both servants born in his household</b><p>Those who had grown up under Abraham&#8217;s roof shared in every privilege and responsibility that came with belonging to him. <a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a> records 318 trained men &#8220;born in his house,&#8221; already demonstrating loyalty in rescuing Lot. By circumcising these men, Abraham acknowledged that covenant blessings (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>) require covenant obedience. It prefigures the New Testament truth that physical proximity to the people of God calls for personal identification with God&#8217;s covenant (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And those purchased from foreigners</b><p>Even slaves bought from outsiders were included. God&#8217;s promise to bless &#8220;all families of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) begins to take shape as non-Israelites are brought under the covenant sign. <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a> later applies the same principle to Passover participation: &#8220;Let all his males be circumcised; then he may come near.&#8221; This foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s reach, where Gentiles are grafted in through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13, 19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were circumcised with him</b><p>The phrase ties every circumcision directly to Abraham&#8217;s own act. <a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a> calls circumcision the &#8220;seal of the righteousness of faith&#8221; that Abraham possessed before the rite, highlighting that the external act followed internal belief. By undergoing the procedure alongside his household, Abraham modeled servant leadership&#8212;he did not demand what he himself would not do. <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-12</a> later draws a line from physical circumcision to the believer&#8217;s spiritual union with Christ, emphasizing heart-level transformation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a> demonstrates comprehensive covenant obedience: every male linked to Abraham&#8212;by birth or purchase&#8212;entered the sign of circumcision together with him. The verse highlights (1) Abraham&#8217;s wholehearted submission, (2) the inclusion of all under his authority, and (3) the early glimpse of God&#8217;s plan to extend covenant grace beyond ethnic boundaries.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/17-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of [Abraham&#8217;s] household&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">both servants born</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3211.htm">Strong's 3211: </a> </span><span class="str2">Born</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his household</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and those purchased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;miq&#183;na&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4736.htm">Strong's 4736: </a> </span><span class="str2">A buying, acquisition, a piece of property, the sum paid</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from foreigners&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were circumcised with him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(nim&#183;m&#333;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4135.htm">Strong's 4135: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut short, curtail, to blunt, to destroy</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/17-27.htm">OT Law: Genesis 17:27 All the men of his house those (Gen.
