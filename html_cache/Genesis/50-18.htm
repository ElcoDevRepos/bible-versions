After the death of their father Jacob, the brothers feared retribution from Joseph for their past wrongs. This act of coming to Joseph signifies their acknowledgment of past sins and their need for forgiveness. It reflects the broader biblical theme of repentance and reconciliation, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, which emphasizes the importance of seeking reconciliation with others.<p><b>bowed down before him</b><br>This act of bowing fulfills Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-10</a>) where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his sheaf. It signifies the fulfillment of God's prophetic word and demonstrates the sovereignty of God in bringing His plans to fruition. Bowing is also a cultural expression of submission and respect, common in ancient Near Eastern societies, indicating their acceptance of Joseph's authority.<p><b>and said, &#8220;We are your slaves!&#8221;</b><br>The brothers' declaration of themselves as slaves is an expression of their fear and submission. It echoes their earlier guilt and recognition of wrongdoing (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>). This statement also contrasts with Joseph's earlier position as a slave in Egypt, highlighting the reversal of roles and the theme of divine justice and mercy. It prefigures the New Testament concept of servanthood, where believers are called to be servants of Christ (<a href="/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>), and reflects the humility required for true repentance and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.
