The plain of the Jordan was well-watered and fertile, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden and the land of Egypt, which Lot had recently experienced. This choice indicates a preference for material prosperity over spiritual considerations. The decision foreshadows future troubles, as the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, located in this region, were known for their wickedness. Lot's choice can be contrasted with Abram's faith-driven decisions, highlighting a theme of faith versus sight.<p><b>and set out toward the east.</b><br>The direction eastward in Genesis often symbolizes moving away from God's presence or blessing. After Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden, they moved eastward. Similarly, Cain went east after being cursed. Lot's journey eastward suggests a departure from the spiritual protection and guidance associated with Abram. This movement also prefigures Lot's eventual entanglement with the sinful cities of the plain, particularly Sodom.<p><b>And Abram and Lot parted company.</b><br>This separation marks a significant moment in the narrative of Genesis, as it allows Abram to fully step into the promises God has for him without the encumbrance of Lot's presence. The parting is amicable, reflecting Abram's character of peace and generosity. It also sets the stage for God's reaffirmation of His covenant with Abram, which follows immediately after this event. The separation can be seen as a necessary step for Abram to fulfill his divine calling, illustrating the biblical principle that sometimes separation is needed for spiritual growth and fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>The nephew of Abram (later Abraham), Lot is a significant figure in Genesis.
