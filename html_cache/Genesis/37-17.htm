The man who speaks to Joseph is unnamed, suggesting divine providence guiding Joseph's journey. This encounter is a pivotal moment, as it sets Joseph on the path that leads to his eventual enslavement in Egypt. The movement of Joseph's brothers reflects their nomadic lifestyle, common in the patriarchal period, where herding and seeking pasture were essential for survival.<p><b>&#8220;I heard them say, &#8216;Let us go to Dothan.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Dothan is a location in the northern part of ancient Israel, known for its fertile land and strategic position on trade routes. This area is mentioned again in <a href="/2_kings/6-13.htm">2 Kings 6:13-17</a>, where Elisha's servant sees the heavenly army. The choice of Dothan by Joseph's brothers may indicate their search for better grazing land. The mention of Dothan also foreshadows Joseph's sale into slavery, as it was near major trade routes to Egypt, facilitating the Ishmaelites' purchase of Joseph.<p><b>So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan.</b><br>Joseph's determination to find his brothers demonstrates his obedience to his father, Jacob, and his commitment to family duties. This journey to Dothan is a critical turning point in Joseph's life, leading to his betrayal and eventual rise to power in Egypt. The narrative highlights themes of divine sovereignty and human agency, as Joseph's actions, though seemingly mundane, are part of God's larger plan. Joseph's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also sent by His Father, faced betrayal, and ultimately brought salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, known for his dreams and the coat of many colors.
