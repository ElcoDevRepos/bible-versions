This phrase indicates Judah's recognition of Joseph's authority and power. The use of "my lord" is also a sign of respect and submission, which is crucial in the context of their desperate situation. Judah's leadership among his brothers is evident here, as he steps forward to speak on their behalf.<p><b>&#8220;How can we plead?</b><br>Judah's rhetorical question suggests a sense of helplessness and acknowledgment of their inability to defend themselves. This reflects the gravity of the situation, as they are accused of theft, a serious crime. The brothers are aware that they have no evidence or argument to prove their innocence, which parallels the human condition of sinfulness and the inability to justify oneself before God without divine intervention.<p><b>How can we justify ourselves?</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of human inadequacy in achieving righteousness through one's own efforts. It echoes the biblical principle that justification cannot be attained by works but is a gift from God (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20-24</a>). Judah's admission of their inability to justify themselves foreshadows the New Testament teaching on justification by faith.<p><b>God has exposed the iniquity of your servants.</b><br>Judah attributes their predicament to divine intervention, acknowledging that God has revealed their guilt. This confession may refer to their past sin of selling Joseph into slavery, suggesting a belief in divine justice and retribution. The concept of God exposing sin is consistent with biblical teachings on God's omniscience and the eventual uncovering of hidden sins (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>We are now my lord&#8217;s slaves&#8212;</b><br>Judah's declaration of their willingness to become slaves reflects the severity of their situation and their submission to Joseph's authority. This statement is significant in the broader narrative of Genesis, as it contrasts with their earlier actions of selling Joseph into slavery. It also prefigures the concept of spiritual slavery to sin and the need for redemption (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>both we and the one who was found with the cup.&#8221;</b><br>Judah includes all the brothers in the punishment, not just Benjamin, who was found with the cup. This act of solidarity and willingness to share in the consequences demonstrates a transformation in the brothers' character, particularly Judah's, who had previously suggested selling Joseph. This change is a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting themes of repentance, unity, and sacrificial love, which are central to the message of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah emerges as a leader among his brothers.
