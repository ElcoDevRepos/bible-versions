The Hittites were a significant group in the ancient Near East, known for their advanced culture and influence. The purchase of the field signifies a legal and permanent claim to the land, emphasizing God's promise to Abraham regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This transaction is one of the earliest recorded land purchases in the Bible, highlighting the importance of legal ownership and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<p><b>Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.</b><br>Abraham's burial alongside Sarah in the cave of Machpelah underscores the significance of family and the continuation of God's covenant through generations. This burial site becomes the family tomb for the patriarchs, as Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah are also buried there (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-32</a>; 50:13). The act of burial in a purchased land reflects Abraham's faith in God's promise of the land to his descendants. It also prefigures the concept of resurrection and eternal life, as the patriarchs are laid to rest in the land promised to them by God. This burial site is a testament to the faith and hope in God's promises, which are ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who secures eternal life for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
