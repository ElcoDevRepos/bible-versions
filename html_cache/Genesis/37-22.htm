This phrase reflects the biblical principle of the sanctity of life, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God establishes the value of human life.

The wilderness setting emphasizes isolation and danger, common themes in biblical narratives where God often tests or refines His people. This act foreshadows Joseph's later imprisonment in Egypt, serving as a type of Christ's burial and subsequent resurrection.<p><b>but do not lay a hand on him.</b><br>Reuben's insistence on not harming Joseph physically highlights his attempt to protect his brother, despite the brothers' jealousy and hatred.

Reuben's plan reflects the biblical theme of redemption and deliverance.<p><b>and return him to his father.</b><br>Reuben's desire to restore Joseph to Jacob highlights the importance of family unity and reconciliation, themes prevalent throughout the Bible. This act anticipates the eventual reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers, mirroring the reconciliation between humanity and God through Christ.

His actions remind us that God often works through imperfect people who nevertheless choose righteousness, setting in motion a plan that will ultimately safeguard His covenant purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Into this pit that is in the wilderness.</span>--Reuben apparently pointed to some cistern in the desolate region which girds the little valley of Dothan around. We learn from <a href="/genesis/42-21.htm" title="And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he sought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come on us.">Genesis 42:21</a> that Joseph begged hard for mercy, and to be spared so painful a death, but that his brothers would not hear.<p>Though never represented in the Scriptures as a type of Christ, yet the whole of the Old Testament is so full of events and histories, which reappear in the Gospel narrative, that the Fathers have never hesitated in regarding Joseph, the innocent delivered to death, but raised thence to glory, as especially typifying to us our Lord. Pascal (<span class= "ital">Pensees, </span>2:9. 2) sums up the points of resemblance--in his father's love for him, his being sent to see after the peace of his brethren, their conspiring against him, his being sold for twenty pieces of silver, his rising from his humiliation to be the lord and saviour of those who had wronged him; and with them the saviour also of the world. As too, he was in prison with two malefactors, so was our Lord crucified between two thieves and as one of these was saved and one left to his condemnation, so Joseph gave deliverance to the chief butler, but to the chief baker punishment. It would be easy to point out other resemblances, but, leaving these, it is important also to notice that Joseph's history is likewise a vindication of God's providential dealings with men. He is innocent, and pure in life, but wronged again and again; yet every wrong was but a step in the pathway of his exaltation. And like the histories of all great lives, Joseph's adventures do not begin and end in himself. Upon him depended a great future. Noble minds care little for personal suffering, if from their pain springs amelioration for the world. Now Joseph's descent into Egypt was: not only for the good and preservation of the people there, but was also an essential condition for the formation of the Jewish Church.
