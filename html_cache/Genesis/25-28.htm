This preference indicates a personal bias that influenced his affection for Esau, who was a skilled hunter. The patriarchal society often valued physical prowess, and Esau's ability to provide game would have been seen as a valuable trait. This favoritism based on personal taste foreshadows the familial tensions and divisions that arise later in the narrative.<p><b>he loved Esau</b><br>Isaac's love for Esau is rooted in his appreciation for the tangible benefits Esau's hunting skills brought. This partiality is significant in the broader biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for the conflict between Esau and Jacob. The favoritism shown by Isaac contrasts with the divine preference for Jacob, highlighting the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing the less likely candidate to fulfill His purposes. This choice echoes other biblical instances where God chooses the younger or less obvious candidate, such as David over his brothers.<p><b>but Rebekah loved Jacob</b><br>Rebekah's love for Jacob introduces a familial division that becomes central to the unfolding story. Her preference is not based on material benefits but perhaps on a deeper understanding of God's purposes, as she had received a prophecy regarding her sons (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). This favoritism aligns with God's plan, as Jacob is the one through whom the covenant promises will continue. Rebekah's role in the narrative is pivotal, as she later orchestrates the deception that secures Jacob's blessing, reflecting the complex interplay of human actions and divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is one of the patriarchs of Israel.
