His interactions with Abraham highlight themes of integrity and divine intervention. Abimelech's response here is part of a dialogue concerning a dispute over a well, which underscores the importance of water rights in the ancient Near East. This interaction also reflects the broader theme of God's protection and provision for Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>I do not know who has done this.</b><br>Abimelech's claim of ignorance suggests a lack of direct involvement or awareness of the actions of his servants. This statement can be seen as an assertion of his integrity, aligning with his previous encounter with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a>, where God warned him in a dream. The phrase emphasizes the importance of truth and transparency in leadership, a principle that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>You did not tell me,</b><br>This part of the dialogue indicates a breakdown in communication between Abraham and Abimelech. It highlights the necessity of clear communication in resolving conflicts, a theme that is prevalent in biblical narratives. The lack of prior notification could suggest a misunderstanding or oversight, which is a common human experience addressed in various biblical teachings.<p><b>so I have not heard about it until today.</b><br>Abimelech's statement underscores the immediacy of the issue and his willingness to address it once informed. This reflects a proactive approach to conflict resolution, which is a valued trait in biblical leadership. The timing of the revelation is significant, as it allows for the resolution of the dispute and the establishment of a covenant between Abraham and Abimelech, furthering God's plan for Abraham's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>A Philistine king who interacts with Abraham.

The king's herdsmen had robbed Abraham of a well, a species of property jealously defended in the East because of its great value, and Abraham in some way had made his displeasure felt. Abimelech, ever friendly towards Abraham, by whose nobleness of character he had been greatly impressed, comes to learn the cause of the coolness, and to enter into a more close and lasting alliance with the patriarch. With Oriental indirectness, he makes no complaint, and speaks only of his wish for continued friendship, but by his allusion to his past kindness hints that this had not been received as it ought. Abraham fully understands his real meaning, and tells him what had happened; whereupon the matter is set right, and Abraham requites his previous generosity with gifts of cattle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abimelech said, I wet not who hath done this thing</span>.
