This moment is significant in the narrative of Joseph, a key figure in the history of Israel. Joseph is the eleventh son of Jacob, also known as Israel, and the firstborn of Rachel. His relationship with his brothers is strained due to Jacob's favoritism towards him, symbolized by the coat of many colors. This favoritism sets the stage for the events that follow, including the brothers' jealousy and eventual betrayal.<p><b>&#8220;Listen to this dream I had:</b><br>Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered messages from God or the gods, and Joseph's dreams are no exception. They play a crucial role in the unfolding of God's plan for Joseph and his family. This particular dream is the first of two that Joseph shares with his brothers, both of which foreshadow his future rise to power and the eventual bowing of his family before him. The act of sharing the dream indicates Joseph's youthful naivety or perhaps a sense of divine purpose. Dreams are a recurring theme in Joseph's life, as seen later when he interprets the dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker, and eventually Pharaoh himself, leading to his rise to power in Egypt. This dream also prefigures the prophetic nature of dreams in the Bible, as seen in the lives of Daniel and others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the favored son of Jacob, known for his dreams and the special coat given to him by his father.

In the absence of information to the contrary, we are warranted in believing that there was nothing either sinful or offensive in Joseph s spirit or manner in making known his dreams. That which appears to have excited the hostility of his brethren was not the mode of their communication, but the character of their contents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/37-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Listen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dream I had:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2492.htm">Strong's 2492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind firmly, to be, plump, to dream</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/37-6.htm">OT Law: Genesis 37:6 He said to them Please hear this (Gen.
