The urgency of their actions highlights the imminent judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah. The angels' intervention signifies divine mercy and protection for the righteous, as seen in other biblical narratives like Noah's deliverance from the flood (Genesis 6-9).<p><b>one of them said, &#8220;Run for your lives!</b><br>The command to "run for your lives" underscores the severity of the impending destruction. It reflects the biblical theme of divine judgment and the necessity of immediate obedience to God's warnings. This urgency is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to flee from sin and pursue righteousness (<a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>).<p><b>Do not look back,</b><br>The instruction not to look back serves as a test of faith and obedience. Lot's wife famously disobeys this command, resulting in her transformation into a pillar of salt (<a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>). This act symbolizes the danger of longing for a sinful past and is referenced by Jesus in <a href="/luke/17-32.htm">Luke 17:32</a> as a warning against spiritual complacency.<p><b>and do not stop anywhere on the plain!</b><br>The plain, or the Jordan Valley, was fertile and appealing but also the site of rampant wickedness. The command to avoid stopping there emphasizes the need to completely separate from sin and its influences. This mirrors the call for believers to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<p><b>Flee to the mountains,</b><br>Mountains often symbolize refuge and divine presence in Scripture. The directive to flee to the mountains suggests seeking safety in God's provision and protection. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>, where the psalmist looks to the hills for help, signifying trust in God's deliverance.<p><b>or you will be swept away!&#8221;</b><br>The warning of being "swept away" indicates total destruction, akin to the flood narrative where those outside the ark perished (<a href="/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>).
