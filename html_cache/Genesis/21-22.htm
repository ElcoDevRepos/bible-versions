Their presence indicates the importance of the meeting. Abimelech's earlier encounter with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a>, where God intervened to protect Sarah, sets a precedent for their relationship. The mention of Phicol suggests the seriousness of the diplomatic engagement, as military leaders were often involved in treaty negotiations.<p><b>said to Abraham</b><br>Abraham, the patriarch, is recognized as a significant figure by surrounding nations.

It echoes the covenantal promise in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>, where God promises to bless Abraham and make his name great. The recognition by foreign leaders serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and the unfolding of His plan through Abraham.

This visit of the king and his vizier appears to have taken place some considerable time after the beginning of the sojourn of Abraham at Gerar; for the friendly feelings which then existed had evidently given way to a coolness, occasioned by the quarrels between their herdsmen. In this narrative, Abraham appears as a chieftain powerful enough for a king to wish to make an alliance with him; and thus his abandonment of Sarah, and his receiving of presents in compensation for the wrong done her, seems the more unworthy of him.
