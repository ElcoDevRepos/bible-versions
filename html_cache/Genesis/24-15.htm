The servant's prayer was specific, showing faith and reliance on God. This reflects the biblical principle that God hears and answers prayers, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20-23</a>, where God responds to Daniel's prayer while he is still speaking.<p><b>Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder</b><br>Rebekah's introduction is significant as she becomes a key figure in the Abrahamic lineage. Her action of carrying a jar on her shoulder is culturally and historically accurate, reflecting the customs of women in ancient Near Eastern societies who often fetched water for their households. This act of service and hospitality foreshadows her suitability as Isaac's wife. The imagery of water and wells is recurrent in the Bible, symbolizing life and sustenance, as seen in <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-14</a> with Jesus and the Samaritan woman.<p><b>She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah</b><br>This genealogical detail establishes Rebekah's lineage, connecting her to Abraham's family. Bethuel's mention ties Rebekah to the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abraham's descendants. The importance of family lineage in biblical times is underscored here, as it was crucial for maintaining the purity of the covenant line. This connection is reminiscent of the genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>, which trace Jesus' lineage.<p><b>the wife of Abraham&#8217;s brother Nahor</b><br>This phrase situates Rebekah within the extended family of Abraham, highlighting the practice of endogamy, or marrying within one's kin, which was common in ancient times to preserve family ties and inheritance. Nahor's mention reinforces the interconnectedness of the patriarchal family and God's unfolding plan through them. This familial connection is significant in the context of God's promises to Abraham, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, where God promises to bless all nations through Abraham's offspring.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A key figure in this passage, Rebekah is introduced as the daughter of Bethuel.

The quick fulfillment assures us of the reliability of prayer offered in faith (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>).<p>&#8226; As with Daniel&#8212;&#8220;While I was still speaking in prayer, Gabriel&#8230; came to me&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a>)&#8212;God answers even as words leave the lips. The text highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty and His delight in guiding those who seek His will (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, it encourages believers to pray expectantly, trusting that God can orchestrate events faster than we imagine (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder</b><p>&#8226; The narrative shifts from prayer to providence: the very person chosen by God steps onto the scene.
