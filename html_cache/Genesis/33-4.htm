In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, running was considered undignified for a man of Esau's status, indicating his genuine emotion and eagerness to reconcile. This act contrasts with Jacob's fear and anticipation of hostility, reflecting a divine intervention in softening Esau's heart. The running can be seen as a parallel to the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), symbolizing forgiveness and restoration.<p><b>and embraced him</b><br>The embrace signifies reconciliation and the restoration of a broken relationship. In biblical times, an embrace was a sign of peace and acceptance. This act fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah that the older would serve the younger (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), yet here it is Esau who takes the initiative to reconcile, showing a reversal of expected roles and highlighting the theme of grace.<p><b>threw his arms around his neck</b><br>This gesture indicates a deep emotional connection and acceptance. In the ancient world, such a physical display was a sign of affection and reconciliation. It also signifies the breaking down of barriers and the healing of past wounds. This act can be seen as a type of Christ's embrace of sinners, offering forgiveness and reconciliation.<p><b>and kissed him</b><br>A kiss in biblical times was a sign of peace, forgiveness, and acceptance. This act further emphasizes the sincerity of Esau's forgiveness. The kiss is reminiscent of the kiss of reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers (<a href="/genesis/45-15.htm">Genesis 45:15</a>), symbolizing the restoration of familial bonds and the overcoming of past grievances.<p><b>And they both wept</b><br>The mutual weeping indicates a shared emotional release and the healing of past hurts. Tears in the Bible often accompany moments of significant emotional or spiritual breakthrough. This moment of weeping can be seen as a type of the future reconciliation between God and humanity, where tears are wiped away (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). The weeping signifies the depth of their reconciliation and the genuine nature of their restored relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder brother of Jacob, son of Isaac and Rebekah.

Yet the little word &#8220;however&#8221; signals God&#8217;s providential surprise. The Lord had already promised Jacob safe return (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>), and, just the night before, Jacob pleaded, &#8220;Deliver me from my brother&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-11.htm">Genesis 32:11</a>).

The urgency recalls the father in <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a> who &#8220;ran to his son&#8221; in forgiveness. Running shows eagerness, not obligation&#8212;grace in motion. It also disarms Jacob, replacing anxiety with relief before a single word is spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and embraced him</b><p>An embrace shuts out distance. In <a href="/genesis/45-14.htm">Genesis 45:14</a> Joseph &#8220;fell upon his brother Benjamin&#8217;s neck and wept,&#8221; signaling total reconciliation.

Running, embracing, kissing, and shared tears form a fourfold picture of grace that ends a long-running family fracture and reminds us that when God answers prayer, He often does so with overwhelming tenderness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Esau ran to meet him.</span>--Whatever may have been Esau's intention when he started, no sooner does he see his brother than the old times of their childhood return to his heart, and he is overcome with love; nor does he ever seem afterwards to have wavered in his fraternal affection. We have had a proof before (in <a href="/genesis/27-38.htm" title="And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.">Genesis 27:38</a>) of Esau being a man of warm feelings, and similarly now he is again overmastered by his loving impulses. It is curious that the Hebrew word for "he kissed him" has had what are called extraordinary vowels attached to it, and the Masorites are supposed to signify thereby that Esau's kiss was not a sign of genuine love. For such an ill-natured supposition there is no warrant whatsoever.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/33-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Esau, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1444;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#347;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6215.htm">Strong's 6215: </a> </span><span class="str2">Esau -- oldest son of Isaac</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ran to him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1512;&#1464;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7323.htm">Strong's 7323: </a> </span><span class="str2">To run</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and embraced him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1428;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7717;ab&#183;b&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2263.htm">Strong's 2263: </a> </span><span class="str2">To clasp, embrace</span><br /><br /><span class="word">threw his arms around</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#183;p&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his neck,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1493;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;aw&#183;w&#257;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6677.htm">Strong's 6677: </a> </span><span class="str2">The back of the neck</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and kissed him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1476;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1476;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1476;&#1511;&#1461;&#1425;&#1476;&#1492;&#1476;&#1493;&#1468;&#1476;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;q&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5401.htm">Strong's 5401: </a> </span><span class="str2">To kiss, to equip with weapons</span><br /><br /><span class="word">And they both wept.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;k&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1058.htm">Strong's 1058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To weep, to bemoan</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">OT Law: Genesis 33:4 Esau ran to meet him embraced him (Gen.
