In ancient times, a scepter was a symbol of royal power and governance. Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, is prophesied to hold a position of prominence and leadership among the tribes. This prophecy is fulfilled in the line of David, who is from the tribe of Judah, and ultimately in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The promise of a scepter indicates a continuous line of rulership, suggesting a divine plan for leadership through Judah.<p><b>nor the staff from between his feet</b><br>The staff, like the scepter, is a symbol of authority and governance. The phrase "from between his feet" can be understood as a reference to lineage and progeny, indicating that the leadership will be passed down through generations. This imagery reinforces the idea of a stable and enduring dynasty. Historically, the tribe of Judah maintained a significant role in the leadership of Israel, with Jerusalem as its capital. The Davidic line, which comes from Judah, is a central theme in the Old Testament, pointing to the coming of a Messiah.<p><b>until Shiloh comes</b><br>The term "Shiloh" is often interpreted as a reference to the Messiah, a figure of peace and ultimate authority. The word "Shiloh" can be translated to mean "he to whom it belongs" or "the one who brings peace." This phrase suggests a future fulfillment when the rightful ruler, the Messiah, will come. In Christian theology, this is seen as a prophecy of Jesus Christ, who is believed to fulfill the role of the promised ruler bringing peace and salvation. The anticipation of Shiloh's coming is a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament, with various prophecies pointing to a future deliverer.<p><b>and the allegiance of the nations is his</b><br>This phrase indicates that the coming ruler will not only have authority over Israel but will also command the allegiance of the nations. It suggests a universal reign, extending beyond the boundaries of Israel to include all peoples. This is seen as a prophetic vision of the Messianic kingdom, where the Messiah will reign over all nations. In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where Jesus commands his disciples to make disciples of all nations, and in the vision of every nation worshiping before the throne in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.

History traces the pledge through David&#8217;s throne, preserves it through exile, and displays its fulfillment in Jesus Christ. As the gospel reaches the ends of the earth, the pledge continues to unfold, assuring believers that God&#8217;s Word stands true and that the King from Judah reigns forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The sceptre shall not depart from Judah.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a sceptre. </span>The staff, adorned with carvings, and handed down from father to son, soon became the emblem of authority (see Note on <a href="/genesis/38-18.htm" title="And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.">Genesis 38:18</a>). It probably indicates here tribal rather than royal rank, and means that Judah would continue, until the time indicated, to be a self-governed and legally-constituted tribe.<p><span class= "bld">Nor a lawgiver from between his feet.</span>--Most modern critics translate <span class= "ital">ruler's staff, </span>but "lawgiver" has the support of all the ancient versions, the Targums paraphrasing it by <span class= "ital">scribe, </span>and the Syriac in a similar way by <span class= "ital">expounder</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the law. <span class= "ital">Ruler's, staffs </span>has the parallelism in its favour, but the ancient versions must not be lightly disregarded, and, besides, everywhere else the word means law-giver (see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-21.htm" title="And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.">Deuteronomy 33:21</a>; <a href="/judges/5-14.htm" title="Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm" title="For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.">Isaiah 33:22</a>). <span class= "ital">"</span>From between his feet" means, "from among his descendants." The Targum of Onkelos renders, "from his children's children."<p><span class= "bld">Until Shiloh come.</span>--Many modern critics translate, "until he come to Shiloh," but this is to be rejected, first, as being contrary to all the ancient versions; and, secondly, as turning sense into nonsense. The town of Shiloh was in the tribe of Ephraim, and we know of no way in which Judah ever went thither. The ark was for a time at Shiloh, but the place lost all importance and sank into utter obscurity after its destruction by the Philistines, long before Judah took the leading part in the commonwealth of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Shiloh.</span>--There are several interpretations of this word, depending upon different ways of spelling it. First, Jerome, in the Vulg., translates it, "He who shall be sent." He read, therefore, <span class= "ital">Shalu'ch. </span>which differs from the reading in the Hebrew text by omitting the <span class= "ital">yod, </span>and putting the guttural <span class= "greekheb"></span> for <span class= "ital">h </span>(Heb., <span class= "greekheb"></span>) as the final letter. We have, secondly, <span class= "ital">Shiloh, </span>the reading of the present Hebrew text. This would mean, <span class= "ital">Peaceful, </span>or <span class= "ital">Peace-maker, </span>and agrees with the title given to the Messiah by Isaiah (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>). But, thirdly, all the versions excepting the Vulg. read <span class= "ital">Sheloh. </span>Thus, the LXX. has, "He for whom it is laid up" (or, according to other MSS., "the things laid up for him."). With the former reading, Aquila and Symmachus agree; with the latter, Theodotion, Epiphanius, and others, showing that Sheloh was the reading in the centuries immediately after the Nativity of our Lord. The Samaritan transcript of the Hebrew text into Samaritan letters reads Sheloh, and the translation into Aramaic treats the word as a proper name, and renders, "Until Sheloh come." Onkelos boldly paraphrases, "Until Messiah come, whose is the kingdom;" and, finally, the Syriac has, "Until he come, whose it is." There is thus overwhelming evidence in favour of the reading Sheloh, and to this we must add that Sheloh is the reading even of several Hebrew MSS. We may, in fact, sum up the evidence by saying that the reading <span class= "ital">Shiloh, </span>even in the Hebrew text, has only modern authority in its favour, and that all ancient authorities are in favour of Sheloh; for even Jerome omits the <span class= "ital">yod, </span>though he changes the aspirate at the end into a guttural. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/49-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The scepter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1433;&#1489;&#1462;&#1496;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;&#183;&#7687;e&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7626.htm">Strong's 7626: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rod, staff, club, scepter, tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">depart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;s&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5493.htm">Strong's 5493: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from Judah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
