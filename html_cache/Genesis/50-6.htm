This phrase indicates Pharaoh's authority and willingness to communicate directly with Joseph, reflecting the respect and trust Joseph had earned. Historically, Pharaohs were seen as divine or semi-divine figures, and their word was law. This interaction shows the unique position Joseph held, as it was uncommon for a Hebrew to have such direct access to the Egyptian ruler.<p><b>Go up</b><br>The phrase "go up" refers to traveling from Egypt to Canaan, which is geographically northward and uphill. In biblical terms, "going up" to Canaan or Jerusalem is often used due to the elevation and spiritual significance of the land. This journey signifies a return to the Promised Land, which holds covenantal importance for the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and bury your father</b><br>Joseph's father, Jacob (also known as Israel), had died in Egypt but desired to be buried in the land of Canaan, in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had purchased as a family burial site. This burial site is significant as it connects the patriarchs to the land promised by God. The act of burial in Canaan underscores the faith in God's promises and the hope of future possession of the land.<p><b>as he made you swear to do</b><br>Jacob had made Joseph swear to bury him in Canaan, which reflects the seriousness of oaths in ancient Near Eastern culture. Swearing an oath was a binding agreement, often invoking God's name, and breaking it was considered a grave offense. This also highlights the importance of honoring one's parents, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, and is later codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The fulfillment of this oath by Joseph demonstrates his integrity and faithfulness to his father's wishes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who grants Joseph permission to bury his father, Jacob, in Canaan.

His immediate response reveals:<p>&#8226; Respect for Joseph. Pharaoh&#8217;s favor toward Joseph had already been demonstrated in <a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-44</a>, and here it continues without hesitation.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence. <a href="/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a> reminds us that Joseph saw his rise as God&#8217;s doing; Pharaoh&#8217;s quick consent is another piece of that divine tapestry (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Protection for the covenant family. Later, <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a> marks a new Pharaoh who does not know Joseph; the contrast highlights how gracious this earlier ruler&#8217;s reply truly was.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go up and bury your father</b><p>- Pharaoh releases Joseph from his official duties so he can keep a sacred family obligation.<p>&#8226; Place matters. Jacob wanted to rest in the cave of Machpelah&#8212;the same ground Abraham bought in <a href="/genesis/23-17.htm">Genesis 23:17-20</a>&#8212;because Canaan, not Egypt, was Israel&#8217;s promised home (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Public witness. A royal entourage will accompany Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-7.htm">Genesis 50:7-9</a>), proclaiming to both Egyptians and Canaanites that the patriarchs lived&#8212;and died&#8212;trusting God&#8217;s promises.<p>&#8226; Hope of resurrection. Physical burial in the promised land points forward to a bodily future (cf. <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a>). Even Jacob&#8217;s death serves the storyline of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as he made you swear to do</b><p>- Pharaoh acknowledges the binding nature of Joseph&#8217;s oath to his father (<a href="/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Biblical gravity of vows. <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> urges that a vow to the LORD must not be broken; Solomon echoes this in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>. By honoring Jacob&#8217;s dying request, Joseph models integrity (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>, &#8220;Let your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be &#8216;Yes.&#8217;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Honoring parents. The soon-to-be-written Fifth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) calls God&#8217;s people to &#8220;honor your father and your mother.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s obedience lives that out ahead of time.<p>&#8226; Covenant continuity. Just as Abraham bound his servant by oath to find Isaac a wife (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>), Jacob binds Joseph; covenant faithfulness is preserved through solemn promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s brief statement in <a href="/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6</a> shows that God, who had elevated Joseph, now uses Egypt&#8217;s throne to safeguard a dying patriarch&#8217;s final wish. The king&#8217;s quick consent underscores Joseph&#8217;s integrity, honors Jacob&#8217;s faith, and moves the covenant family one step closer to the promised land&#8212;all reinforcing that when God makes promises, He also arranges the circumstances so His people can walk in them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</span> Pharaoh's answer would, of course, be conveyed through the courtiers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/50-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Go up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and bury</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;q&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6912.htm">Strong's 6912: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your father,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he made you swear [to do].&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1462;&#1469;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#353;&#183;b&#238;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7650.htm">Strong's 7650: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seven oneself, swear</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/50-6.htm">Genesis 50:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/50-6.htm">OT Law: Genesis 50:6 Pharaoh said Go up and bury your (Gen.
