This exemption highlights the special status of the priestly class in ancient Egypt, who were often supported by the state. This reflects a broader biblical theme where religious leaders are set apart, as seen in the Levitical priesthood in Israel (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). The priests' exemption from land acquisition underscores their societal role and the respect afforded to religious duties.<p><b>for it had been given to them by Pharaoh</b><br>Pharaoh's provision for the priests indicates the centralized power of the Egyptian monarchy and its role in maintaining religious institutions. This mirrors the later provision for the Levites in Israel, who were given cities and pasturelands (Joshua 21) but not a tribal inheritance, as their portion was the Lord. The Pharaoh's support of the priests can be seen as a type of divine provision, prefiguring God's care for His chosen servants.<p><b>They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied</b><br>The priests' sustenance through Pharaoh's rations reflects the dependency of religious institutions on the state in ancient Egypt. This arrangement ensured the priests' loyalty and the continuation of religious practices. In a broader biblical context, this can be compared to God's provision for His people, such as the manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of God supplying the needs of His servants (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><b>so they did not sell their land</b><br>The priests' retention of their land signifies their stable and privileged position in Egyptian society. Unlike the common people who sold their land to survive the famine, the priests' land remained intact, symbolizing the enduring nature of their religious office. This can be contrasted with the Israelites' later experience in Canaan, where land inheritance was tied to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>).

Compare <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20&#8211;24</a>, where the Levites are likewise exempt from holding agricultural land so they can focus on sacred duties.<p>&#8226; By recording this exemption, the narrative affirms that those set apart for worship were shielded from economic upheaval, reflecting the priority given to spiritual service (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh&#8217;s Provision to Priests</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; for it had been given to them by Pharaoh.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/47-22.htm">Genesis 47:22</a>b)<p>&#8226; Pharaoh himself had previously granted the priests an allotment, establishing a royal endowment for their livelihood (see <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>, where Joseph marries into a priestly family, showing the office&#8217;s high esteem).<p>&#8226; This royal generosity mirrors later biblical patterns in which governing authorities support God&#8217;s servants&#8212;e.g., <a href="/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21&#8211;24</a>, where Persian kings supply temple needs.<p>&#8226; The arrangement demonstrates that civil leadership can recognize and uphold the sanctity of religious vocation without conflict (<a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3&#8211;4</a> notes rulers as God&#8217;s ministers for good).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rations Sustain the Priests</b><p>&#8220;They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/47-22.htm">Genesis 47:22</a>c)<p>&#8226; Because their daily sustenance was guaranteed, the priests never faced the desperation that drove other Egyptians to surrender property (<a href="/genesis/47-13.htm">Genesis 47:13&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; This steady provision freed them to maintain worship practices on behalf of the nation, much like the later Levites who rely on tithes so they can &#8220;stand to minister&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The text subtly points to God&#8217;s faithfulness in safeguarding worship even when the surrounding world is shaken (<a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-22.htm">Genesis 47:22</a> highlights God-ordained protection for those devoted to sacred service. While famine forced the rest of Egypt to relinquish land, the priests retained theirs because Pharaoh&#8212;God&#8217;s providential instrument&#8212;had already secured their allotment and daily rations. This preserved the nation&#8217;s spiritual life in crisis and models the biblical principle that material provision should free ministers to focus on worship and teaching. The verse therefore underscores both divine care for His servants and the enduring priority of true worship amid temporal upheaval.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The priests had a portion assigned to them of Pharaoh.</span>--Herodotus (ii. 37) mentions that it was still the custom in Egypt for the priests to have a daily allowance of' cooked food. Very probably this usage began in Joseph's time; but it is not here ascribed to him, but to the king himself.
