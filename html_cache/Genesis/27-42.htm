The "words" refer to Esau's intention to kill Jacob after being deceived out of his blessing. This reflects the deep-seated animosity between the brothers, a theme that echoes the earlier conflict between Cain and Abel. The relaying of these words suggests a network of communication within the family, possibly involving servants or other family members, highlighting the tension and division within Isaac's household.<p><b>she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him</b><br>Rebekah's action in sending for Jacob indicates her protective nature and favoritism towards him, which has been evident since <a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>. This favoritism is a recurring theme in the patriarchal narratives, often leading to family strife. Her decision to inform Jacob of Esau's intentions shows her proactive role in ensuring his safety, which aligns with the prophecy given to her during her pregnancy that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you.</b><br>Esau's consolation in plotting Jacob's death reveals the depth of his anger and sense of betrayal. This reflects the cultural importance of the birthright and blessing in ancient Near Eastern societies, where such rights were tied to inheritance and family leadership. The phrase underscores the seriousness of Esau's intentions and the imminent danger Jacob faces. This situation foreshadows future sibling rivalries in the Bible, such as those between Joseph and his brothers. It also highlights the theme of fraternal conflict and reconciliation, which is ultimately resolved later in <a href="/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a> when Esau and Jacob meet again.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The mother of Esau and Jacob, who plays a pivotal role in the events leading up to Jacob's deception of Isaac and the subsequent fallout.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The older son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is angered by Jacob's deception and plans to kill him after their father's death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who deceives his father to receive the blessing meant for Esau, leading to his need to flee for his life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The father of Esau and Jacob, who is deceived by Jacob into giving him the blessing intended for Esau.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plot.htm">The Plot</a></b><br>Esau's plan to kill Jacob in revenge for stealing his blessing, which Rebekah learns about and warns Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Deception, even when seemingly justified, leads to broken relationships and unintended consequences.

He was now formally acknowledged as the heir of the birthright and of the promises made to Abraham, and must therefore conform to the principle laid down in his own father's case, and marry into the family of Nahor. "She sends, therefore, and calls him" to her tent, and takes secret counsel with him; and Jacob consents to take this distant journey.
