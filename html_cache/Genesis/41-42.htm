It was used to seal documents, signifying the Pharaoh's approval and command. By removing it from his own finger, Pharaoh was transferring a significant portion of his authority to Joseph. This act is reminiscent of the authority given to Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2-3</a>) and foreshadows the authority given to Jesus by God the Father (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>put it on Joseph&#8217;s finger</b><br>This gesture signified Joseph's elevation to a position of high authority, second only to Pharaoh. It marked a dramatic change in Joseph's status, from a Hebrew slave and prisoner to the ruler over all of Egypt. This transformation is a type of Christ, who was exalted after His suffering (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>clothed him in garments of fine linen</b><br>Fine linen was a luxury fabric in ancient Egypt, often associated with nobility and the priesthood. Joseph's new garments symbolized his new status and purity. This change in clothing can be compared to the robe given to the prodigal son upon his return (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>) and the righteousness believers receive in Christ (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>and placed a gold chain around his neck</b><br>The gold chain was another symbol of high rank and honor. In Egyptian culture, such adornments were given to those who held significant positions of power. This act further solidified Joseph's authority and acceptance into the Egyptian court.

Whoever bore it carried the king&#8217;s personal authority. Compare how Ahasuerus&#8217; ring in <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a> empowered Mordecai to legislate in the king&#8217;s name, or how <a href="/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a> speaks of Zerubbabel as God&#8217;s signet, emphasizing delegated rule.<p>- Pharaoh&#8217;s act is immediate and public. <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a> already noted Joseph&#8217;s hurried summons; now Pharaoh swiftly moves from Joseph&#8217;s prison garb to royal empowerment, underlining God&#8217;s sudden promotion of the faithful (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>- By taking the ring off his own hand, Pharaoh signals total trust. Joseph is no mere adviser; he becomes the executor of royal will, prefiguring Christ, to whom the Father &#8220;has given all authority&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>put it on Joseph&#8217;s finger</b><p>- The transfer is personal: Pharaoh himself places the ring on Joseph. It mirrors the father placing the ring on the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>), a picture of restored status and sonship.<p>- Joseph, once falsely accused and forgotten, now bears the kingdom&#8217;s seal. This underscores <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a>&#8212;the Lord turns every injustice to advance His redemptive plan.<p>- Practically, the ring authorizes Joseph to collect grain, open storehouses, and sell to the nations (<a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56-57</a>). God equips those He calls, never assigning responsibility without conferring authority (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>clothed him in garments of fine linen</b><p>- Linen signified royalty and priestly purity. <a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a> describes priestly tunics of fine linen, and <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a> shows Belshazzar clothing Daniel the same way for interpreting writing on the wall.<p>- Joseph&#8217;s new wardrobe replaces prison rags (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>). <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> foretells that God &#8220;has clothed me with garments of salvation,&#8221; a fitting parallel: outward dress reflects inward appointment.<p>- Pharaoh&#8217;s gift prepares Joseph to serve in court confidently; it also displays to Egypt that Joseph&#8217;s authority is legitimate, not borrowed. Such visible tokens matter in a world that judges by sight (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and placed a gold chain around his neck</b><p>- A gold chain was a public badge of honor, as later with Daniel (<a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>). Its weight reminded the wearer&#8212;and onlookers&#8212;of bestowed dignity and responsibility.<p>- Gold symbolizes enduring worth (<a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>). Joseph&#8217;s integrity proved more valuable than any adornment, yet God adds tangible honor (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p>- The chain also hints at the wisdom Joseph displayed. <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a> says, &#8220;Bind kindness and truth around your neck,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> calls such qualities &#8220;a graceful garland.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s character now wears a literal counterpart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a> records Pharaoh&#8217;s fourfold act&#8212;removing his own signet ring, placing it on Joseph, clothing him in fine linen, and hanging a gold chain around his neck. Each gesture legally and visibly installs Joseph as second-in-command. The ring confers authority, the linen declares elevated status and purity, and the gold chain proclaims honor. Together they testify that God can, in a single moment, lift the faithful from obscurity to influence, equipping them fully for His purposes and displaying His sovereignty before the watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">His ring.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">his signet ring. </span>As decrees became law when stamped with the royal signet, it was naturally the symbol of authority; and so with us, at the formation of a ministry the great seal is formally delivered into the hands of the highest legal personage in the realm, who is thus invested with power.<p><span class= "bld">Vestures of fine linen.</span>--The word used here is Egyptian, <span class= "ital">shesh, </span>and signifies a kind of flax from which linen of great fineness and whiteness was made. Much of the dress of the Levitical priests was to be made of this flax, called in Hebrew byssus (<a href="/exodus/39-28.htm" title="And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,">Exodus 39:28</a>, &c.), In the East it is usual on all occasions of showing the royal favour, to give changes of raiment: but there is here the further signification, that as this fine white linen was the special dress of the king and the priests, the bestowal of it indicated Joseph's admission into the ruling classes of Egypt. Probably, as he married a priest's daughter, he was himself also previously enrolled among the ranks of the priesthood.<p><span class= "bld">A gold chain.</span>--This also appears upon the monuments as one of the royal insignia.
