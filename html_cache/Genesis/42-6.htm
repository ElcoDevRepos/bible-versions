After being sold into slavery by his brothers, Joseph's journey from a prisoner to the second most powerful man in Egypt highlights themes of redemption and divine purpose. His position as ruler is a fulfillment of the dreams he had as a young man, where his family would bow to him, indicating God's sovereign plan.<p><b>he was the one who sold grain to all its people.</b><br>During the severe famine, Joseph's role was crucial in managing the distribution of grain. This not only saved Egypt but also surrounding nations, including his own family. Joseph's wisdom and administrative skills, given by God, were instrumental in this process. This act of providing sustenance can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual nourishment and salvation to all who come to Him.<p><b>So when his brothers arrived,</b><br>The arrival of Joseph's brothers in Egypt is a pivotal moment in the narrative. It sets the stage for reconciliation and the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams. This journey from Canaan to Egypt was likely arduous, reflecting the desperation caused by the famine. The brothers' arrival also signifies the beginning of God's plan to bring the family of Israel into Egypt, setting the stage for future events in biblical history.<p><b>they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.</b><br>This act of bowing fulfills the prophetic dreams Joseph had in his youth, where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his sheaf. It symbolizes the realization of God's promises and the unfolding of His divine plan. The brothers' bowing is also a cultural expression of respect and submission to authority, common in ancient Near Eastern societies. This moment foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and restoration of relationships within Jacob's family, illustrating themes of forgiveness and divine orchestration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Once sold into slavery by his brothers, Joseph has risen to become the ruler of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh.
