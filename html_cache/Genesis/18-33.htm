The interaction highlights the intimate relationship between God and Abraham, often referred to as a friend of God (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>). The LORD's willingness to engage in conversation with Abraham demonstrates His personal nature and His openness to human intercession. This moment is pivotal in understanding the role of prayer and intercession in the life of believers, as it shows that God listens and responds to the concerns of His people.<p><b>He departed</b><br>The departure of the LORD signifies the end of the divine visitation. In the context of <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, the LORD appeared to Abraham in the form of a man, accompanied by two angels. This theophany, or visible manifestation of God, is a rare and significant event in the Old Testament. The departure also foreshadows the impending judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah, as the LORD's presence moves from a place of dialogue to a place of action. This transition underscores the dual nature of God as both merciful and just.<p><b>and Abraham returned home</b><br>Abraham's return home signifies a return to normalcy after a profound spiritual encounter. It reflects the pattern of divine encounters in Scripture, where individuals often return to their daily lives transformed or with a renewed sense of purpose. Abraham's home, located in the region of Mamre near Hebron, is significant as a place of divine revelation and covenantal promises (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). This phrase also emphasizes the faith and obedience of Abraham, who, after interceding for Sodom, trusts in God's righteous judgment and returns to his responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>In this passage, the LORD refers to God Himself, who is engaging in a direct conversation with Abraham.

(<a href="/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>a)<p>&#8226; This signals the end of an intimate, face-to-face dialogue in which Abraham interceded for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-32</a>).<p>&#8226; It shows that God sets the terms and duration of every conversation; when He has revealed all that is needed, He concludes it&#8212;similar to <a href="/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>, where He &#8220;finished speaking&#8221; and &#8220;went up from&#8221; Abraham.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that God listens to and honors faithful intercession, yet retains final authority (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording that the LORD &#8220;finished,&#8221; Scripture highlights the completeness of divine revelation for that moment&#8212;no unfinished business, no unanswered questions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He departed</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;He departed&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>b)<p>&#8226; The LORD&#8217;s physical withdrawal marks the close of a theophany&#8212;God appearing in human form (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His departure immediately precedes judgment on Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>), reminding us that mercy and warning always come before wrath (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar departures follow other divine encounters: the Angel of the Lord disappearing after speaking with Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>) and Manoah (<a href="/judges/13-20.htm">Judges 13:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s leaving is never abandonment; rather, it is movement toward the next stage of His plan, just as Christ&#8217;s ascension preceded the sending of the Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Abraham returned home</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and Abraham returned home.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>c)<p>&#8226; Abraham goes back to &#8220;his place,&#8221; likely his tent near the oaks of Mamre (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>), demonstrating obedience and trust after intercession.<p>&#8226; His return shows that extraordinary moments with God equip believers for ordinary life; we are to resume our responsibilities after prayer (<a href="/genesis/22-19.htm">Genesis 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham does not follow the LORD to see the outcome; he leaves the results with God, embodying faith (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This quiet ending contrasts with the dramatic events about to unfold in Sodom, highlighting the peace that comes from communion with God (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a> portrays the orderly close of divine-human dialogue: God speaks fully, departs purposefully, and Abraham returns peacefully.

Besides the primary object of making known the perfect justice of God's dealings with men, it further showed that the Gentile world was both subject to Jehovah's dominion, and that there was mercy for it as well as for the covenant people.
