If an animal was killed by a predator, the shepherd was expected to provide evidence, such as a piece of the animal, to prove it was not due to negligence. Jacob's statement reflects his integrity and diligence in his duties. This phrase highlights the challenges faced by shepherds, a role that is often used metaphorically in Scripture to describe leadership and care, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>I bore the loss myself.</b><br>Jacob's willingness to absorb the loss personally demonstrates his commitment and fairness, contrasting with the typical practice where losses were often shared or compensated by the employer. This self-sacrificial attitude can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the ultimate loss for humanity's sins. It also reflects the biblical principle of taking responsibility for one's actions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>, which praises diligence.<p><b>And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night.</b><br>This phrase indicates the harsh and unjust treatment Jacob received from Laban, his employer and father-in-law. In the cultural context, it was unusual for a shepherd to be held accountable for theft, especially at night when it was harder to guard the flock. This reflects the broader biblical theme of unjust suffering and perseverance, as seen in the lives of Joseph and David. It also foreshadows the trials faced by Jesus, who was unjustly accused and suffered despite His innocence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

Shepherds in the Ancient Near East often brought a mutilated carcass to prove an unavoidable loss (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-13.htm">Exodus 22:13</a>, &#8220;If it was torn by beasts, let him bring it as evidence&#8230;&#8221;). Jacob chose a higher standard.<p>&#8226; His vigilance foreshadows the Good Shepherd who protects the flock at all costs (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>). Like David who &#8220;struck down both the lion and the bear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>), Jacob defended what was entrusted to him.<p>&#8226; The passage showcases practical righteousness: &#8220;The righteous man cares for the needs of his animal&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>). Jacob&#8217;s care reflected an obedience that treated stewardship as worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I bore the loss myself</b><p>&#8226; Instead of passing the expense to Laban, Jacob absorbed every deficit&#8212;living out the principle later codified in <a href="/exodus/22-12.htm">Exodus 22:12</a>, where the keeper must &#8220;make restitution&#8221; if an animal is lost.<p>&#8226; Such sacrificial integrity prefigures Christ, who assumed our debt (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Jacob&#8217;s willingness points to a larger biblical theme: the innocent bearing the cost for others.<p>&#8226; Personal cost did not embitter him; it sanctified his labor. &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). Jacob&#8217;s paycheck came ultimately from God, not from Laban&#8217;s shifting terms (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night</b><p>&#8226; Laban enforced a relentless policy&#8212;Jacob paid even for theft, night or day. Scripture later protects workers from such extremes: &#8220;Do not oppress a hired servant&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>) and &#8220;Masters, grant your slaves what is right and fair&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>). Laban ignored those moral boundaries.<p>&#8226; Jacob endured twenty years of this (<a href="/genesis/31-38.htm">Genesis 31:38-41</a>), trusting divine justice. <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a> warns employers who withhold wages; Jacob&#8217;s story illustrates that warning in the Old Testament economy.<p>&#8226; Yet Jacob stayed faithful: &#8220;Servants, submit&#8230; bearing up under unjust suffering&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18-19</a>). God eventually vindicated him by multiplying the flock despite Laban&#8217;s schemes (<a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a> showcases Jacob&#8217;s unwavering integrity under an unfair boss.
