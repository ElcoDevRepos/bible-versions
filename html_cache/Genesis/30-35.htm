This reflects the ongoing tension and mistrust between Laban and Jacob, a theme that runs throughout their relationship.<p><b>Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats</b><br>In the ancient Near East, livestock was a primary measure of wealth. By removing these animals, Laban was attempting to limit Jacob's potential for prosperity. This act can be seen as a form of deception, as Laban had agreed to give Jacob the speckled and spotted animals as his wages.<p><b>and every speckled or spotted female goat</b><br>The specific mention of both male and female goats highlights the thoroughness of Laban's actions. In biblical times, goats were valuable for their milk, meat, and hides, making them an important asset.<p><b>every one that had any white on it</b><br>The detail of "any white" indicates the meticulous nature of Laban's removal process. This phrase underscores the extent to which Laban was willing to go to ensure that Jacob would not gain from the flock.<p><b>and every dark-colored lamb</b><br>Dark-colored lambs were less common, and their removal further reduced the likelihood of Jacob's success. This action reflects Laban's cunning and manipulative character, which is consistent with his previous behavior in Genesis.<p><b>and he placed them under the care of his sons</b><br>By entrusting the animals to his sons, Laban ensured that the flock would be kept separate from Jacob's care. This move not only prevented Jacob from accessing the animals but also kept the oversight within Laban's family, maintaining control over the situation. This act of placing the animals under his sons' care can be seen as a protective measure to safeguard his interests.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the father-in-law of Jacob and a key figure in Jacob's life.

His haste shows his resolve to secure advantage before Jacob could begin tending the herd. Similar urgency appears in <a href="/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55-58</a> when Rebekah&#8217;s family tries delaying her departure&#8212;demonstrating how family decisions often pivot on the very day they are made. The verse reminds us that timing is part of God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats</b><p>Laban personally separates the most clearly marked males, the very animals Jacob expected would become his wages. By doing so, he stacks the deck against Jacob. <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a> warns, &#8220;Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD,&#8221; and <a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a> later records Jacob&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;Your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times.&#8221; Yet God ultimately overrules human scheming (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And every speckled or spotted female goat</b><p>Not content with the males, Laban also gathers the visibly marked females, reducing the likelihood of future speckled offspring for Jacob. This parallels the greed seen in <a href="/numbers/22-15.htm">Numbers 22:15-17</a> where Balak offers greater rewards to Balaam, revealing how covetous hearts escalate demands. Laban&#8217;s thoroughness illustrates the depths to which selfish ambition will go (<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every one that had any white on it</b><p>Laban&#8217;s criteria even include goats with the slightest white&#8212;an extreme measure to strip Jacob&#8217;s potential herd down to nothing. Such nitpicking recalls <a href="/matthew/23-24.htm">Matthew 23:24</a>, where Jesus speaks of straining out a gnat while swallowing a camel. Laban&#8217;s hyper-scrutiny exposes how sin rationalizes over-control and manipulation (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And every dark-colored lamb</b><p>Though Jacob had asked only for goats, Laban seizes dark-colored lambs too, expanding the removal to another species. <a href="/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a> notes Jacob bore &#8220;the scorching heat by day and the frost by night,&#8221; underscoring the hardship caused by Laban&#8217;s overreach. Yet <a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7-9</a> urges the righteous to &#8220;be still before the LORD&#8221; and trust Him when the wicked prosper temporarily.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he placed them under the care of his sons</b><p>By handing the animals to his sons and separating them by a three-day journey (<a href="/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>), Laban ensures Jacob cannot access them. This delegation highlights how family can be drawn into one man&#8217;s deceit (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). Nevertheless, <a href="/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a> later testifies, &#8220;Thus God has taken away your father&#8217;s livestock and given them to me,&#8221; confirming divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a> portrays Laban&#8217;s calculated removal of every potentially speckled or dark animal to thwart Jacob&#8217;s wages. Each phrase reveals a deeper layer of his manipulation: immediate timing, exhaustive selection, and strategic relocation. Though Laban&#8217;s tactics seem successful, subsequent chapters show God safeguarding Jacob and turning the very scheme to Jacob&#8217;s benefit. The verse therefore underscores God&#8217;s sovereign care for His people amid human deceit, encouraging believers to remain faithful and trust His righteous intervention.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">And he removed.</span>--The question has been asked whether it was Jacob or Laban who made the division, and whether Jacob was to have all such sheep and goats as were parti-coloured already, or such only as should be born afterwards. The authors of the Authorised Version evidently thought that Laban himself removed all speckled sheep and goats, and kept them; but the Hebrew is by no means so much in favour of this view as their own translation. Thus, in <a href="/genesis/30-32.htm" title="I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.">Genesis 30:32</a> they insert "of such" in italics; the Hebrew distinctly says, <span class= "ital">And it shall be my hire: </span>that is, every one speckled or spotted shall be <span class= "ital">mine, </span>the singular number being used throughout. Next, in <a href="/genesis/30-33.htm" title="So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.">Genesis 30:33</a> they translate, <span class= "ital">in time to come: </span>according to this, if the particoloured sheep and goats at any time produced white or black lambs, as they generally would, such would revert to Laban; the Hebrew says, <span class= "ital">My righteousness shall answer for me to-morrow. </span>Jacob was to make the selection at once, but the next day Laban was to look over all those put aside, and if he found among them any white sheep, or black or brown goats, he was to regard them as stolen--that is, not merely might he take them back, but require the usual fine or compensation.<p><span class= "bld">And gave them into the hand of his sons.</span>--It has been assumed that these were Laban's sons, on the ground that Jacob's sons were not old enough to undertake the charge; but as Reuben was twenty-six, this was not the case. Jacob's flocks would have fared but badly if they had been entrusted to Laban's sons, nor could he, six years later, have escaped, had his property been in their keeping, without Laban being immediately aware of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - Laban (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Delitzsch, Kalisch, Murphy, <span class="accented">et alii</span>);
