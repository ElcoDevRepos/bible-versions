His interactions with Jacob are marked by manipulation and self-interest. This phrase introduces Laban's response to Jacob's desire to leave, highlighting Laban's cunning nature.<p><b>&#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes,</b><br>This phrase reflects the cultural norms of the time, where seeking favor was a common way to negotiate and maintain relationships. It shows Laban's attempt to persuade Jacob by appealing to their familial bond and past interactions.<p><b>please stay.</b><br>Laban's request for Jacob to stay is driven by his recognition of the prosperity Jacob's presence has brought. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of blessings being tied to individuals and their God-given favor.<p><b>I have learned by divination</b><br>Divination was a common practice in the ancient world, used to discern the will of the gods or gain insight into future events. Although divination is condemned in later biblical texts (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>), it was a method Laban used to understand the source of his prosperity.<p><b>that the LORD has blessed me because of you.&#8221;</b><br>Laban acknowledges that his blessings are due to Jacob's presence, indirectly recognizing the power of Jacob's God, the LORD. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's covenantal blessings extending to those associated with His chosen people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises Abraham that all peoples on earth will be blessed through him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah, making him Jacob's uncle.

Laban&#8217;s pattern of manipulation is evident earlier when he switched brides (<a href="/genesis/29-21.htm">Genesis 29:21&#8211;27</a>) and later when he repeatedly changes Jacob&#8217;s wages (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture reminds us that speech can expose motives: &#8220;For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). Here, Laban&#8217;s priority is profit, not relationship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I have found favor in your eyes</b><p>&#8226; The phrase sounds humble, yet it is a negotiating tactic. Laban flatters Jacob to secure continued benefit.<p>&#8226; Similar wording appears when Abraham pleads for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>) and when Joseph&#8217;s brothers speak to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/47-25.htm">Genesis 47:25</a>), but in those cases the request seeks mercy; Laban seeks material advantage.<p>&#8226; Favor ultimately comes from God, not human manipulation (<a href="/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>please stay</b><p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s plea underscores his dependence on Jacob. Prosperity followed Jacob&#8217;s arrival (<a href="/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast: Abraham&#8217;s servant refused to delay after completing his mission (<a href="/genesis/24-54.htm">Genesis 24:54&#8211;56</a>), showing that godly purpose outweighs personal profit.<p>&#8226; Staying or leaving must align with God&#8217;s timing, not human pressure (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have learned by divination</b><p>&#8226; Laban admits consulting occult practices to discern why his wealth increased. Such methods were later forbidden to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God overrules even pagan inquiry to highlight His sovereignty; He allowed Laban to recognize the true source of blessing. A comparable instance occurs when Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians acknowledge, &#8220;This is the finger of God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The text does not endorse divination; it simply records Laban&#8217;s carnal attempt to gain insight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD has blessed me</b><p>&#8226; Ironically, the diviner must confess YHWH&#8217;s hand. Laban uses God&#8217;s covenant name, acknowledging the very God he does not serve.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promise to Abraham&#8212;&#8220;I will bless those who bless you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>)&#8212;is being fulfilled through Jacob, Abraham&#8217;s grandson.<p>&#8226; Later, Potiphar observes the same principle with Joseph: &#8220;The LORD blessed the Egyptian&#8217;s house on account of Joseph&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-5.htm">Genesis 39:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of you</b><p>&#8226; Jacob is the conduit of blessing. God&#8217;s covenant streams through His chosen people to the surrounding nations, anticipating the ultimate blessing in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob himself will testify, &#8220;The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I worked&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>).<p>&#8226; This pattern recurs: families, workplaces, and even nations can experience tangible good when God&#8217;s people walk faithfully (<a href="/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a> reveals a self&#8211;interested Laban pleading with Jacob to remain because he has discovered&#8212;by unapproved means&#8212;that the LORD&#8217;s favor on Jacob spills over onto him. The verse underscores three truths: God&#8217;s blessings are real and observable, they flow through His covenant people to others, and even unbelievers may recognize the hand of the LORD while still pursuing their own agendas.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">I have learned by experience.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">I have divined. </span>The verb means, <span class= "ital">to speak between the teeth; to mutter magical formul?. </span>Others wrongly suppose that it signifies "to divine by omens taken from serpents;" and some imagine that Laban had consulted his teraphim. Words of this sort lose, at a very early date, their special signification, and all that Laban means is--"I fancy," I conjecture." His answer is, however, most Oriental. It is courtly and complimentary, but utterly inconclusive. "If now I have found favour in thine eyes, I have a feeling that God hath blessed me for thy sake." It, of course, suggests that he would be glad if Jacob would remain with him.
