In the context of <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, these angels had come to the city to investigate its wickedness and ultimately to rescue Lot and his family. The angels' intervention highlights the divine protection over Lot, a theme consistent with God's care for His people throughout Scripture. The act of reaching out symbolizes God's initiative in saving humanity, a precursor to the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ.<p><b>pulled Lot into the house with them</b><br>Lot's rescue by the angels signifies God's mercy and deliverance. Lot, despite his compromised position in Sodom, is still considered righteous (<a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7-8</a>). This act of pulling Lot to safety can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where believers are drawn out of sin and into the safety of God's presence. The house represents a place of refuge, akin to the spiritual refuge found in Christ.<p><b>and shut the door.</b><br>Shutting the door serves as a protective barrier against the impending judgment on Sodom. It signifies the separation between the righteous and the wicked, a recurring biblical theme. This action parallels the closing of Noah's ark door before the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>), symbolizing divine protection and the finality of God's judgment. It also foreshadows the eschatological separation of the sheep and the goats (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>), where the righteous are secured in God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, residing in Sodom.
