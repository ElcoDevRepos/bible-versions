In the context of ancient Israel, certain actions were considered unacceptable due to the covenant relationship with God. The refusal indicates a commitment to uphold the family&#8217;s honor and religious principles, which were deeply intertwined with their identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>they said.</b><br>The speakers here are the sons of Jacob, specifically Simeon and Levi, who are responding to Shechem's proposal. Their collective voice signifies unity in their decision, emphasizing the importance of family consensus in matters of honor and religious observance. This also highlights the patriarchal structure of the family, where male members often made crucial decisions.<p><b>To give our sister to an uncircumcised man</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It was a physical mark of belonging to God's people and a commitment to His laws. Marrying an uncircumcised man would mean aligning with those outside the covenant, which was seen as a violation of their religious and cultural identity. This phrase underscores the importance of maintaining purity and separation from pagan practices.<p><b>would be a disgrace to us.</b><br>The term "disgrace" indicates a profound sense of shame and dishonor that would result from such an action. In the cultural context of the time, honor and shame were pivotal social values. The disgrace mentioned here is not only personal but communal, affecting the entire family and their standing before God and among other tribes.

Like Peter and the apostles declaring, &#8220;We must obey God rather than men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>), they place obedience above convenience.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows conviction rather than negotiation, reminding us of Joshua&#8217;s &#8220;as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They said</b><p>&#8226; This is a united family response, not just an individual opinion.
