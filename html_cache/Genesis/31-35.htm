This interaction highlights the familial tensions and the complex dynamics within the household. Rachel's relationship with her father is strained due to Jacob's departure and the theft of Laban's household idols.<p><b>&#8220;Sir, do not be angry that I cannot stand up before you;</b><br>Rachel addresses her father with respect, using a term of deference. Her request for understanding is strategic, as she seeks to avoid suspicion. In the cultural context, standing in the presence of a father or elder was a sign of respect, and her inability to do so would typically require a valid reason.<p><b>for I am having my period.&#8221;</b><br>Rachel uses her menstrual cycle as an excuse, which in the cultural and religious context of the time, rendered her ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-24</a>). This would have been a plausible reason for her not to rise, as it was a time when women were often secluded. This excuse also served to deter Laban from searching her immediate area, as touching anything she sat on would also render him unclean.<p><b>So Laban searched but could not find the household idols.</b><br>Laban's search for the household idols, or "teraphim," reflects the importance of these objects in his household. These idols were often associated with inheritance rights and household protection. The fact that Laban could not find them despite his search indicates Rachel's cunning and the providential protection over Jacob's family. This incident foreshadows the eventual separation of Jacob's family from Laban's influence and the establishment of their own identity, free from idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The wife of Jacob and daughter of Laban, who is involved in the deception regarding the household idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Rachel's father, who is searching for his stolen household idols.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Rachel's husband, who has fled from Laban with his family and possessions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_idols.htm">Household Idols (Teraphim)</a></b><br>Small idols or figurines that were often used for divination or as symbols of inheritance rights.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_jacob.htm">The Camp of Jacob</a></b><br>The location where Laban searches for his idols, representing a place of tension and confrontation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/deception_and_its_consequences.htm">Deception and Its Consequences</a></b><br>Rachel's use of deception to hide the idols from Laban shows the moral complexities and potential consequences of deceit.

Scripture often records respectful speech toward elders (<a href="/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>). By choosing courtesy instead of confrontation, Rachel follows the principle that &#8220;a gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A plea to avert anger</b><p>&#8220;Do not be angry&#8221; marks Rachel&#8217;s desire to keep hostilities low during a tense search for Jacob&#8217;s possessions. Similar language appears when Jacob later warns Laban that God &#8220;rebuked you last night&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>), underscoring that human anger must bow to divine oversight (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>). Rachel&#8217;s words temporarily calm Laban, buying time for her deception to remain hidden.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An appeal to ceremonial uncleanness</b><p>&#8220;I cannot stand up before you; for I am having my period.&#8221; Under Mosaic law later codified, a woman&#8217;s menstrual flow rendered her ceremonially unclean and required separation from normal activity (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>). Though the Law was not yet given, the cultural concept of impurity was already familiar. Rachel leverages that expectation:<p>&#8226; Standing would expose the saddle beneath which the idols were hidden (<a href="/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Claiming menstrual uncleanness made physical contact taboo, deterring Laban from insisting she rise.<p>While the Bible records her ruse, it does not condone it; deceit violates God&#8217;s standard (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>). Yet the narrative reminds that God often works through flawed people, as seen earlier with Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-19.htm">Genesis 27:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Laban&#8217;s futile search and God&#8217;s protection</b><p>&#8220;So Laban searched but could not find the household idols.&#8221; The idols, symbols of false security (<a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>), are powerless to expose Rachel or to shield Laban&#8217;s interests. God frustrates the plans of the crafty (<a href="/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>). His covenant purposes for Jacob remain intact despite human scheming, fulfilling the promise first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-35.htm">Genesis 31:35</a> shows Rachel using respectful language and cultural norms about menstrual uncleanness to hide stolen idols. Her tactic soothes Laban&#8217;s temper and thwarts his search, yet also displays human deceit. The verse ultimately highlights God&#8217;s sovereign protection of Jacob&#8217;s family and the futility of idolatry, reinforcing that His purposes stand even when people act with mixed motives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said to her father,</span> - "covering theft by subtlety and untruth" (Kalisch), and thus proving herself a time daughter of Laban, as well as showing with how much imperfection her religious character was tainted - <span class="cmt_word">Let it not displease my lord</span> - literally, <span class="accented">let it not burn with anger</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to glow, to burn) <span class="accented">in the eyes of my lord</span> (Adoni) - <span class="cmt_word">that I cannot rise up before thee</span>; - Oriental politeness required children to rise up in the presence of their parents (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>; and cf. <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>).

That, prior to the law, this particular statute concerning women was in force among the Aramaeans appears from the present instance; and that it was not exclusively Jewish, but shared in by other nations of antiquity, is the opinion of the best authorities (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kurtz, 'History of the Old Covenant,' &sect; 79; 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 213; Keil <span class="accented">in loco</span>; both of whom quote Bahr's 'Symbolik of the Mosaic Cultus,' 2. 466). Roberts mentions that under similar circumstances with Rachel no one in India goes to the temple or any religious ceremony ('Oriental Illustrations,' p. 37) - <span class="cmt_word">is upon me</span>. It is just possible Rachel may have been speaking the exact truth, though the probability is she was guilty of fabrication. And he searched (everywhere except among the camel's furniture, partly from fear of defilement, but chiefly as regarding it impossible that Rachel in her then state would sit upon his gods), but found not the images (teraphim). The three times repeated phrase "he found not," emphasizes the completeness, of Lahan's deception. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Rachel] said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
