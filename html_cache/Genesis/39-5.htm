Joseph's journey from being sold into slavery by his brothers to becoming a trusted overseer reflects God's providential care and the fulfillment of His purposes. This mirrors the biblical theme of God elevating the humble, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like David and Daniel. The trust placed in Joseph by Potiphar, an Egyptian official, underscores Joseph's integrity and the favor he found in the eyes of others, a recurring theme in his life.<p><b>the LORD blessed the Egyptian&#8217;s household on account of him</b><br>The blessing of Potiphar's household due to Joseph's presence is a testament to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This reflects the broader biblical principle that God's people can be a source of blessing to others. It also foreshadows the role of Israel as a light to the nations. The mention of "the LORD" (Yahweh) indicates the covenantal relationship and divine favor that extends beyond Joseph to those around him.<p><b>The LORD&#8217;s blessing was on everything he owned, both in his house and in his field</b><br>This comprehensive blessing signifies God's abundant provision and favor, affecting all aspects of Potiphar's estate. The distinction between "house" and "field" suggests a holistic prosperity, covering both domestic and agricultural domains. This echoes the blessings described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for obedience to God. The phrase also prefigures the New Testament teaching that believers are to be salt and light in the world, influencing all areas of life. The prosperity of Potiphar's household serves as a type of the spiritual and material blessings that come through Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man sold into slavery by his brothers, who becomes a trusted overseer in Potiphar's house.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/potiphar.htm">Potiphar</a></b><br>An Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, who purchases Joseph as a slave.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who blesses Potiphar's house because of Joseph.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph is taken as a slave, representing a place of both trial and divine providence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/potiphar's_house.htm">Potiphar&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The setting where Joseph serves and where God's blessing is evident due to Joseph's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_brings_blessing.htm">God's Presence Brings Blessing</a></b><br>Joseph's account illustrates that God's presence in our lives can bring blessings to those around us, even in difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Joseph remained faithful and diligent despite his status as a slave, showing that our circumstances do not define our ability to serve God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/influence_of_a_godly_life.htm">Influence of a Godly Life</a></b><br>Joseph's integrity and work ethic had a profound impact on Potiphar's household, reminding us that our actions can testify to God's goodness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor_and_responsibility.htm">Divine Favor and Responsibility</a></b><br>With God's favor comes responsibility; Joseph managed Potiphar's household with wisdom and integrity, setting an example for us to steward our roles well.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>Joseph's journey from slavery to leadership in Egypt demonstrates God's sovereign plan and purpose, encouraging us to trust Him in our own lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_39_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 39:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_did_Joseph_bless_Potiphar_s_house.htm">How did God bless Potiphar's house because of Joseph's presence in Genesis 39:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_39_5_God_s_faithfulness_shown.htm">What does Genesis 39:5 reveal about God's faithfulness to His servants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Spot_God_s_blessings_at_work_like_Joseph.htm">How can we recognize God's blessings in our workplace as Joseph did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Bible_stories_God_s_blessings_via_followers.htm">What other Bible stories show God blessing others through His faithful followers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Joseph_s_integrity_today.htm">How can we apply Joseph's example of integrity and faithfulness in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_39_5_Joseph_s_blessing_in_Egypt.htm">How does Genesis 39:5 illustrate God's blessing through Joseph's presence in Potiphar's house?

As soon as Joseph is elevated, a new chapter of favor begins (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-4</a>).<p>- This timing shows cause and effect: God&#8217;s hand was already with Joseph, and when Potiphar recognized Joseph&#8217;s reliability, the blessing spread outward.<p>- Similar patterns appear with Laban recognizing blessing through Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>) and later with Daniel promoted in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of his household and all he owned</b><p>- Joseph&#8217;s authority isn&#8217;t limited to a small task; it covers everything.

Even a pagan Egyptian benefits because he aligns himself with a son of the covenant.<p>- This blessing is tangible, not abstract. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> pictures the righteous person as a tree &#8220;that yields its fruit in season,&#8221; and Potiphar&#8217;s estate becomes that fruitful tree through Joseph.<p>- The principle remains: believers serve as conduits of God&#8217;s favor wherever they work (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD&#8217;s blessing was on everything he owned</b><p>- Scripture emphasizes totality: &#8220;everything,&#8221; not a selective portion. Just as Obed-Edom&#8217;s entire household prospered when the ark rested there (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>), Potiphar experiences across-the-board increase.<p>- This comprehensive blessing underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over all spheres&#8212;economic, relational, agricultural. <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> reminds us that &#8220;every good and perfect gift is from above.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both in his house and in his field</b><p>- The phrase spans domestic life and agricultural enterprise, covering indoor and outdoor spheres. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3-6</a> lists similar categories (&#8220;city and country&#8230; basket and kneading bowl&#8221;) when describing covenant blessing.<p>- The blessing proves measurable: livestock multiply, crops flourish, servants prosper.
