It suggests a period of waiting and testing for Joseph, which is a recurring theme in his story. The concept of waiting is significant in biblical narratives, often associated with spiritual growth and preparation for future roles, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses and David.<p><b>the king&#8217;s cupbearer and baker</b><br>The cupbearer and baker were important officials in the Egyptian court, responsible for the king's food and drink. Their roles were crucial for the king's safety, as they protected him from potential poisoning. This highlights the trust and responsibility placed on these individuals. The mention of these specific roles provides insight into the structure and hierarchy of ancient Egyptian society, where such positions were held by trusted servants.<p><b>offended their master,</b><br>The term "offended" suggests a serious breach of trust or misconduct. In ancient Near Eastern courts, offenses by royal officials could lead to severe consequences, including imprisonment or execution. This reflects the absolute authority of the king and the precarious nature of serving in his court. The narrative sets the stage for Joseph's interaction with these officials, which will play a pivotal role in his eventual rise to power.<p><b>the king of Egypt.</b><br>The "king of Egypt" refers to Pharaoh, the ruler of one of the most powerful and advanced civilizations of the ancient world. Egypt was known for its wealth, architectural achievements, and complex social structure. The mention of Pharaoh connects the story to the broader historical and cultural context of the time, emphasizing the significance of Joseph's eventual influence in such a prominent empire. This also foreshadows Joseph's future role in God's plan to preserve the Israelites during a time of famine, as he gains favor with Pharaoh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cupbearer.htm">Cupbearer</a></b><br>An official in the royal court responsible for serving wine to the king.

As we learn in <a href="/genesis/40-11.htm" title="And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.">Genesis 40:11</a> that it was grapewine which he gave the king to drink, this chapter has been the main dependence of the new critics for their proof that the Book of Genesis was not written by Moses. For Herod. (i. 77) says, "The Egyptians make use of wine prepared from barley, because there are no vineyards in their country." As Herodotus was thirteen centuries later than the time of Joseph, they argue not only that the vine could not have been introduced into Egypt at so early a date, but that the records of Joseph's life could not have been put together by anyone acquainted with Egypt, in spite of their exact knowledge in all other respects of Egyptian customs. But when we turn to Herodotus himself, we find the most complete refutation of the previous statement. For, in Book ii. 37, speaking of the liberal treatment of the priests, he says, that they had an allowance of "grape-wine." Again, in Genesis 39, he tells us that it was the custom to pour wine on a victim about to be sacrificed. To one used to the extensive vineyards of Greece and Asia Minor, the comparative scarcity of the vine, and the use of another ordinary drink in its place, would be striking; but that he was guilty of gross exaggeration in his statement is proved by evidence far more trustworthy than his own writings. For, on the tombs at Beni-hassan, which are anterior to the time of Joseph, on those at Thebes, and on the Pyramids, are representations of vines grown in every way, except that usual in Italy, festooned on trees; there is every process of the vintage, grapes in baskets, men trampling them in vats, various forms of presses for squeezing out the juice, jars for storing it, and various processes, even of the fermentation, noticed. Numerous engravings of the sculptures and paintings on these ancient monuments may be seen in Wilkinson's <span class= "ital">Egypt; </span>and most abundant evidence of the culture of the vine in ancient Egypt has been collected, and an account of the vines grown there given in Malan's <span class= "ital">Philosophy or Truth, </span>pp. 31-39.
