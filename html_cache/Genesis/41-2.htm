The imagery of cows coming up from the river reflects the dependence on the Nile for sustenance and prosperity. Cows were symbols of wealth and abundance, and the number seven often signifies completeness or divine perfection in biblical literature. This scene foreshadows the seven years of plenty that Joseph later interprets. The well-fed cows represent a time of prosperity, aligning with the biblical theme of God's provision. The river can also symbolize life and sustenance, drawing a parallel to Jesus as the living water in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>.<p><b>and began to graze among the reeds</b><br>Reeds were common along the banks of the Nile, providing a natural habitat for livestock. Grazing among the reeds suggests a peaceful and abundant environment, indicative of the prosperity Egypt would experience. This setting emphasizes the natural order and God's provision through creation. The act of grazing signifies contentment and fulfillment, which contrasts with the subsequent famine. The peaceful scene can be seen as a type of the peace and provision found in Christ, who is the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).

Yet here it is also literal&#8212;seven distinct animals that will later be interpreted as seven literal years (<a href="/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26, 29</a>).<p>&#8226; Cows matter. In Egypt they represented wealth, nourishment, and even divine favor, so Pharaoh would instinctively sense that his kingdom&#8217;s well-being was on the line (<a href="/genesis/47-17.htm">Genesis 47:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Behind the scene is the sovereign God who &#8220;declares the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>). He sends a warning that embraces every corner of the land, from the palace to the pasture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sleek and well-fed</b><p>&#8226; The cows are described as &#8220;sleek and well-fed&#8221;&#8212;literally healthy, glossy, and full. Their appearance paints a picture of overflowing abundance, exactly what Joseph will confirm: &#8220;Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-29.htm">Genesis 41:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Other passages echo this idea of God-given plenty: &#8220;You crown the year with Your bounty&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a>) and &#8220;The pastures of the wilderness overflow&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12-13</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s dream uses a familiar agricultural image to show prosperity at its peak.<p>&#8226; The detail assures us that God&#8217;s provision can be lavish. Just as the cows lack nothing, so God&#8217;s people can trust His ability to supply (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came up from the river</b><p>&#8226; They &#8220;came up from the river,&#8221; unmistakably the Nile.

If the Nile was healthy, the nation flourished.<p>&#8226; By staging the dream at the Nile, God pinpoints the very artery of Egypt&#8217;s economy. He shows He is Lord not only over Israel but over every nation&#8217;s sources of strength (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The upward movement&#8212;cows rising out of the water&#8212;hints at provision already in motion, soon to appear in everyday life (<a href="/genesis/41-47.htm">Genesis 41:47-49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Began to graze among the reeds</b><p>&#8226; Finally, the cows &#8220;began to graze among the reeds.&#8221; Reeds lined the riverbanks where fresh shoots grew, ideal feeding grounds. The animals settle in confidently, picturing sustained wellbeing rather than a fleeting moment.<p>&#8226; The dream&#8217;s calm setting contrasts sharply with what follows in verses 3-4, heightening the warning. Abundance is real, but so is its potential loss.<p>&#8226; Scripture often associates lush pasture with peace and safety (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>). God wants Pharaoh&#8212;and us&#8212;to recognize that tranquil seasons are His gift, never to be taken for granted (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-2.htm">Genesis 41:2</a> opens Pharaoh&#8217;s dream with a vivid snapshot of perfect prosperity: seven healthy cows emerge from the life-giving Nile and graze contentedly along its reeds. In literal history those cows stand for seven actual years of overflowing harvests. In unfolding prophecy they remind us that God rules over every economy, warns before He judges, and generously supplies before He asks us to steward. Trust the Giver, prepare as He directs, and never mistake temporary plenty for permanent security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Kine.</span>--The cow was regarded by the Egyptians as the symbol of the earth, and of agriculture; and naturally both the kine and the ears of wheat rose out of the river, because as no rain falls in Egypt, its fertility entirely depends upon the overflow of the Nile.

According to Plutarch and Clement of Alexandria, the heifer was regarded by the ancient Egyptians as a symbol of the earth, agriculture, and the nourishment derived therefrom. It was therefore natural that the succession of seven prosperous years should be represented by seven thriving cows. That they appeared ascending from the river is explained by the circumstance that the Nile by its annual inundations is the cause of Egypt's fertility (cf. Havernick, 'Introd.,' 21). A hymn to the Nile, composed by Euna (according to the generality of Egyptologers a contemporary of Moses), and translated from a papyrus in the British Museum by Canon Cook (who ascribes to it an earlier date than the nineteenth dynasty), describes the Nile as "overflowing the gardens created by Ra giving life to all animals....watering the land without ceasing...
