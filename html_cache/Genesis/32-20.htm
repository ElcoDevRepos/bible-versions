The term "servant" reflects Jacob's attempt to placate Esau by acknowledging his own lower status, despite having received the birthright and blessing. This approach is consistent with the cultural norms of the time, where showing deference could help resolve conflicts. The phrase "right behind us" indicates Jacob's physical proximity, suggesting his willingness to confront the situation directly, yet cautiously.<p><b>For he thought, &#8220;I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me.</b><br>Jacob's plan to appease Esau with gifts is a strategic move rooted in the customs of the ancient Near East, where gifts were often used to secure favor or reconciliation. This reflects a broader biblical theme of reconciliation and the importance of peace among brothers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>, which states, "A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great." The act of sending gifts ahead can also be seen as a type of Christ, who goes before us to prepare the way for reconciliation with God.<p><b>After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's hope that Esau will accept him after receiving the gifts underscores the uncertainty and fear Jacob feels about their reunion. This reflects the human condition of seeking forgiveness and reconciliation, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. The phrase "perhaps he will accept me" indicates Jacob's reliance on God's providence, as he ultimately trusts in God's promise to protect him and his family. This moment foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation found in Christ, who reconciles humanity to God, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.
