In the biblical context, "walking with God" suggests a life of faith, obedience, and communion with the Creator. Enoch's walk with God is reminiscent of the relationship Adam and Eve had with God in the Garden of Eden before the Fall, symbolizing a return to divine fellowship. This phrase is significant as it sets Enoch apart from others in the genealogical list of <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, emphasizing his righteousness and devotion. The concept of walking with God is echoed in other scriptures, such as Noah in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, and is a call for believers to live a life of faith and obedience (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>and then he was no more</b><br>This phrase suggests a sudden and mysterious departure from the earthly realm. Unlike the other patriarchs listed in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, whose deaths are recorded with the phrase "and he died," Enoch's departure is unique. The absence of a death record implies that Enoch did not experience death in the traditional sense. This phrase has intrigued scholars and theologians, leading to various interpretations about the nature of Enoch's departure. It highlights the extraordinary nature of Enoch's life and relationship with God.<p><b>because God had taken him away</b><br>This phrase provides the reason for Enoch's disappearance, attributing it directly to God's action. The Hebrew word used here for "taken" can also mean "to receive" or "to carry away," suggesting a divine intervention. This event is seen as a precursor to the concept of the rapture, where believers are taken up by God, as described in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>. Enoch's translation to heaven without experiencing death is a type of Christ's ascension and a foreshadowing of the believer's hope of eternal life. This phrase is further explained in <a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>, which states that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death, emphasizing his faith and God's approval.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enoch.htm">Enoch</a></b><br>A descendant of Adam through Seth, Enoch is noted for his close relationship with God.

It shows a man who cultivated daily fellowship with God, disappeared from earthly view without experiencing death, and entered the Lord&#8217;s presence by divine action. Enoch&#8217;s story testifies that walking closely with God is possible, pleasing to Him, and ultimately rewarded with an unbroken, eternal communion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Enoch walked with God.</span>--This is translated in the LXX., "Enoch pleased God," whence comes the "testimony" quoted in <a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm" title="By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.">Hebrews 11:5</a>. Really it gives the cause of which the Greek phrase is the effect; for it denotes a steady continuance in well-doing, and a life spent in the immediate presence of and in constant communion with God. (See Note on <a href="/genesis/4-18.htm" title="And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.">Genesis 4:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">God took him.</span>--Instead of the mournful refrain <span class= "ital">and he died, </span>coming like a surprise at the end of each of these protracted lives, we have here an early removal into another world, suggesting already that long life was not the highest form of blessing; and this removal is without pain, decay, or death into the immediate presence of God. Thus one of Adam's posterity after the fall succeeded in doing, though, doubtless, not without special help and blessing from the Almighty, that wherein Adam in Paradise had failed. We learn, too, from <a href="/context/jude/1-14.htm" title="And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,">Jude 1:14-15</a>, that Enoch's was a removal from prevailing evil to happiness secured. Already, probably, the intermarriages between the Cainites and Sethites had begun and with it the corruption of mankind. Philippson, while regarding the phrase "God took him" as a euphemism for an early death, yet finds in it an indication of there being another life besides this upon earth. We may further add that Enoch's translation took place about the middle of the antediluvian period, and that his age was 365, the number of the days of the year. As, however, the Hebrew year consisted of only 354 days, and the Chaldean of 360, the conclusion that Enoch was a solar deity has no solid foundation to rest upon. But see Note on <a href="/genesis/8-14.htm" title="And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.">Genesis 8:14</a>.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/5-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Enoch</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2585.htm">Strong's 2585: </a> </span><span class="str2">Enoch -- four Israelites, sons of Cain, Jered, Midian and Reuben</span><br /><br /><span class="word">walked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;hal&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
