Joseph, once sold into slavery by these same brothers, has risen to a position of power in Egypt. This revelation is a turning point, highlighting themes of forgiveness and reconciliation. Joseph's declaration is a fulfillment of the dreams he had as a young man (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), where his brothers would bow to him. This moment also prefigures Christ, who reveals Himself to His brethren, the Jews, and ultimately to the world.<p><b>Is my father still alive?&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's inquiry about his father, Jacob, underscores the deep familial bonds and his longing for reconciliation with his family. Despite his brothers' betrayal, Joseph's concern for his father shows his forgiving nature. This question also reflects the importance of family lineage and heritage in the biblical narrative, as Jacob is a patriarch in the line of Abraham, through whom God's covenant promises are fulfilled.<p><b>But they were unable to answer him,</b><br>The brothers' inability to respond indicates their shock and fear. They are confronted with the reality of their past sins and the power Joseph now holds. This moment of silence can be seen as a time of reflection and realization of the consequences of their actions. It parallels the human response to divine revelation, where individuals are often left speechless in the presence of God's truth and justice.<p><b>because they were terrified in his presence.</b><br>The brothers' terror is a natural reaction to the unexpected revelation and the potential for retribution. Joseph, as a type of Christ, embodies both judgment and mercy. This fear can be likened to the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). It also foreshadows the fear and awe that will accompany the final revelation of Christ to the world, where He will be recognized as Lord and King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers.
