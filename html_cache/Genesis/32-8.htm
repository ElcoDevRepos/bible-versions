It reflects his cautious nature and the wisdom he has gained through his experiences. Jacob's thought process reveals his concern for his family's safety and his desire to preserve his lineage, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham and Isaac.<p><b>&#8220;If Esau comes and attacks one camp</b><br>Jacob anticipates a potential threat from Esau, his brother, whom he had deceived years earlier. This reflects the tension and unresolved conflict between the two brothers. Historically, Esau had vowed to kill Jacob after Jacob stole his blessing (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>). The mention of "one camp" suggests Jacob's large entourage, which includes his family, servants, and livestock, indicating his prosperity and God's blessing despite his fears.<p><b>then the other camp can escape.&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's plan to divide his people into two camps is a strategic move to ensure the survival of at least part of his family. This reflects his resourcefulness and leadership. The division of the camps can be seen as a practical application of the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, which speaks of the prudent seeing danger and taking refuge.
