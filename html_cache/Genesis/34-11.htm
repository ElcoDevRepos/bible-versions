This reflects the patriarchal society where negotiations and decisions were made by male family members. The Hivites were a Canaanite tribe, and their interactions with the Israelites often led to conflicts and moral challenges. This moment is pivotal as it sets the stage for the subsequent actions of Dinah's brothers, Simeon and Levi, who later deceive and attack Shechem and his city.<p><b>&#8220;Grant me this favor</b><br>Shechem is seeking to make amends and secure Dinah as his wife, which was a common practice in ancient times to resolve such situations. The request for a favor indicates a desire for reconciliation and an attempt to legitimize his actions through marriage. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where marriage could be used to settle disputes and form alliances.<p><b>and I will give you whatever you ask.</b><br>Shechem's offer to give whatever is asked demonstrates his desperation and willingness to pay a bride price, a customary practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This also highlights the economic and social negotiations involved in marriage arrangements. The open-ended nature of his offer suggests the gravity of his offense and his earnestness in seeking to rectify it.
