The poplar, almond, and plane trees were common in the region, known for their flexibility and availability. The use of these particular trees may have symbolic significance, as each tree has unique properties. Poplar trees are often associated with rapid growth, almond trees with vigilance and watchfulness (as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>), and plane trees with strength and endurance. This action by Jacob is part of a larger narrative where he seeks to increase his flocks, demonstrating his resourcefulness and understanding of animal husbandry. The choice of fresh branches indicates the importance of vitality and life in the process Jacob is about to undertake.<p><b>and peeled the bark</b><br>Peeling the bark from the branches is a deliberate act by Jacob, revealing his knowledge of the natural world. This action may have been intended to influence the breeding of the animals, as it was believed that visual stimuli could affect the outcome of offspring. This practice reflects the ancient understanding of genetics and selective breeding, even though it may not align with modern scientific principles. The act of peeling also symbolizes uncovering or revealing, which can be seen as a metaphor for divine revelation or the uncovering of God's plans.<p><b>exposing the white inner wood of the branches</b><br>The exposure of the white inner wood is significant, as it creates a visual contrast that could have been intended to influence the animals during mating. White often symbolizes purity and holiness in biblical literature, and this imagery might suggest a deeper spiritual meaning. The act of exposing the inner wood can be seen as a metaphor for revealing the inner truth or essence, aligning with themes of revelation and divine insight. This action by Jacob is part of a broader narrative where God blesses him, despite the unconventional methods, highlighting God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham and son of Isaac, Jacob is a central figure in Genesis.
