It echoes the biblical theme of accountability for one's actions, reminiscent of God's question to Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>. The phrase highlights the moral and ethical expectations within the narrative, emphasizing the seriousness of the brothers' alleged crime.<p><b>Joseph declared.</b><br>Joseph, the governor of Egypt, is speaking with authority. His position allows him to test his brothers' integrity. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as Joseph's declaration sets the stage for the revelation of his identity. Joseph's role as a leader in Egypt is a type of Christ, who also reveals truth and tests the hearts of men.<p><b>Do you not know that a man like me</b><br>Joseph refers to his status and wisdom, which were recognized by Pharaoh and the Egyptian people. His position as a diviner or interpreter of dreams was well-known, as seen in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. This phrase underscores the respect and fear he commanded, which is crucial for understanding the brothers' reaction.<p><b>can surely divine the truth?</b><br>The term "divine" here refers to Joseph's ability to discern truth, often associated with his God-given gift of interpreting dreams. This ability is not through pagan practices but through divine insight, as seen in his interpretations in <a href="/genesis/40.htm">Genesis 40-41</a>. This foreshadows the ultimate revelation of truth when Joseph reveals his identity, paralleling Christ's role as the revealer of divine truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to power.

The pattern highlights accountability before divine authority.<p>&#8226; By asking, Joseph presses the brothers to face their past deceit&#8212;selling him into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>)&#8212;and their present predicament.<p>&#8226; Like Samuel&#8217;s challenge to Saul, &#8220;What have you done?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a>), the question urges confession, a key step toward reconciliation (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph declared.</b><p>&#8226; As Egypt&#8217;s governor (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40&#8211;41</a>), Joseph speaks with undeniable authority; his word can imprison or release (<a href="/genesis/42-19.htm">Genesis 42:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Though still hidden, Joseph acts as God&#8217;s instrument, echoing <a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>: &#8220;It is God who judges; He brings one down, He exalts another.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His declaration frames the coming revelation. The divine pattern often uses a mediator&#8212;Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>), Nathan before David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>)&#8212;to expose sin and offer grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you not know that a man like me can surely divine the truth?</b><p>&#8226; In the Egyptian court, &#8220;divination&#8221; was common.

Joseph&#8217;s brothers cannot conceal guilt; neither can we.<p>&#8226; God sometimes permits the appearance of worldly methods to accomplish His purposes&#8212;as with Balaam&#8217;s pagan visions later bent to bless Israel (<a href="/bsb/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s statement therefore:<p>&#8211; Heightens the brothers&#8217; fear, driving them to honesty (<a href="/genesis/44-16.htm">Genesis 44:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Reinforces that true revelation originates with God, not magic (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8211; Foreshadows Christ, who &#8220;knew all men&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24&#8211;25</a>) and exposes the heart (<a href="/john/4-16.htm">John 4:16&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-15.htm">Genesis 44:15</a> shows Joseph using authoritative, culturally familiar language to confront his brothers&#8217; sin, compel confession, and reveal that nothing escapes divine knowledge.
