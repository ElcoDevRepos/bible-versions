This fear is rooted in past experiences, as Laban had previously deceived Jacob by switching Leah for Rachel on their wedding night (<a href="/genesis/29-23.htm">Genesis 29:23-25</a>). Fear is a common human emotion seen throughout Scripture, often leading to reliance on God for protection and guidance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>, "When I am afraid, I put my trust in you."<p><b>Jacob answered,</b><br>Jacob's response indicates a moment of honesty and vulnerability. Throughout his life, Jacob often relied on his cunning and resourcefulness, but here he openly admits his fear. This moment is part of Jacob's ongoing transformation, which culminates in his wrestling with God in <a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>, where he is renamed Israel.<p><b>for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.</b><br>Jacob's concern about Laban taking his daughters by force highlights the patriarchal and familial dynamics of the time. Marriages were often arranged, and women were considered part of the father's household until marriage. Laban's previous actions, such as the deception with Leah and Rachel, suggest he might use force to assert his will. This fear also underscores the importance of family and inheritance in the ancient Near Eastern context, where family ties were crucial for social and economic stability. The protection of one's family is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the story of Moses' mother hiding him from Pharaoh's decree (<a href="/exodus/2.htm">Exodus 2:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and husband to Leah and Rachel.

Just as his grandfather Abraham once wavered when fear gripped him (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11-13</a>), Jacob admits the same human weakness. Scripture repeatedly shows that even covenant people can be rattled:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/32-7.htm">Genesis 32:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed&#8221; when anticipating Esau&#8217;s approach.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> warns, &#8220;The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is set securely on high.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet God continually says, &#8220;Do not fear&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>), signaling that fear should never have the final word in a believer&#8217;s decision-making.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jacob answered</b><p>By responding forthrightly to Laban&#8217;s accusation, Jacob models the value of giving a clear account (cf. <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; His answer exposes the truth rather than hiding behind excuses (<a href="/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a> shows he had previously &#8220;stole away unawares&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Speaking up also fulfills Jesus&#8217; counsel: &#8220;For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). Jacob&#8217;s heart condition&#8212;fear&#8212;now comes into the light.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I thought</b><p>The phrase points to the inner reasoning that shaped Jacob&#8217;s choice to flee. Scripture reminds us that what we &#8220;think&#8221; can either align with the Lord&#8217;s wisdom or spiral toward self-protective schemes (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a> notes, &#8220;The LORD knows the thoughts of man; He knows that they are futile.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s thinking did not include the Lord&#8217;s recent reassurance (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>)&#8212;&#8220;Return to the land of your fathers, and I will be with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Fear-based logic often sidelines God&#8217;s promises, leading to hasty plans rather than faith-filled obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You would take your daughters from me by force</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s worst-case scenario centers on losing his wives, Rachel and Leah, to Laban&#8217;s strong-arm tactics. Earlier the sisters themselves felt treated as property by their father (<a href="/genesis/31-14.htm">Genesis 31:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Laban had already shown willingness to manipulate&#8212;switching daughters on the wedding night (<a href="/genesis/29-23.htm">Genesis 29:23-25</a>) and repeatedly altering Jacob&#8217;s wages (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob anticipated coercion, echoing later biblical scenes where fathers or rulers seized women (<a href="/judges/21-23.htm">Judges 21:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God had promised protection (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24, 29</a>). Jacob&#8217;s dread underestimated that safeguard, illustrating how fear distorts reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s statement unpacks a progression familiar to all believers: fear enters, shapes our private thoughts, and then drives self-protective actions that ignore God&#8217;s explicit assurances. <a href="/genesis/31-31.htm">Genesis 31:31</a> challenges us to confront fear with faith, let our words reflect trust rather than panic, and remember that God&#8217;s covenant care is stronger than any human threat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31, 32) <span class= "bld">Jacob answered.</span>--Jacob gives the true reason for his flight; after which, indignant at the charge of theft, he returns, in his anger, as rash an answer about the teraphim as Joseph's brethren subsequently did about the stolen cup (<a href="/genesis/44-9.htm" title="With whomsoever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.">Genesis 44:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Let him not live.</span>--The Rabbins regard this as a prophecy, fulfilled in Rachel's premature death.
