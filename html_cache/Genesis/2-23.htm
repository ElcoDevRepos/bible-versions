It marks the first instance of human speech in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of communication and relationship. Adam's declaration is a response to God's creation of Eve, underscoring the divine intention for companionship.<p><b>This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh;</b><br>Adam recognizes Eve as part of himself, indicating a profound unity and equality between man and woman. This expression signifies the intimate connection and shared essence between them, reflecting the Hebrew concept of "one flesh" in marriage. It also prefigures the unity of believers with Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-30.htm">Ephesians 5:30-32</a>, where Paul draws a parallel between the marital relationship and the relationship between Christ and the Church.<p><b>she shall be called &#8216;woman,&#8217;</b><br>The naming of Eve signifies authority and responsibility, as naming in the ancient Near Eastern context often implied dominion or stewardship. The Hebrew word for "woman" (ishah) is closely related to the word for "man" (ish), highlighting their shared nature and mutual dependence. This connection underscores the complementary roles of men and women in God's design.<p><b>for out of man she was taken.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase explains the origin of woman, emphasizing that she was created from man, not as an afterthought, but as an essential counterpart. It reflects the biblical theme of unity and diversity within creation. The creation of Eve from Adam's rib symbolizes equality and partnership, not subordination.

It means, therefore, <span class= "ital">this time, </span>or colloquially, <span class= "ital">at last. </span>Adam had long studied the natural world, and while, with their confidence as yet unmarred by human cruelty, they came to his call, grew tame, and joined his company, he found none that answered to his wants, and replied to him with articulate speech. At last, on waking from his trance, he found one standing by him in whom he recognised a second self, and he welcomed her joyfully, and exclaimed, "This <span class= "ital">at last </span>is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:" that is, she is man's counterpart, not merely in feeling and sense--his flesh--but in his solid qualities. In several of the Semitic dialects <span class= "ital">bone </span>is used for <span class= "ital">self. </span>Thus, in the <span class= "ital">Jerusalem Lectionary </span>(ed. Miniscalchi, Verona, 1861) we read: "I will manifest my bone unto him" (<a href="/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>), that is, myself; and again, "I have power to lay it down of my bone" (<a href="/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>), that is, of myself. So, too, in Hebrew, "In the selfsame day" is "in the bone of this day" (<a href="/genesis/7-13.htm" title="In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;">Genesis 7:13</a>). Thus <span class= "ital">bone of my bones </span>means "my very own self," while <span class= "ital">flesh of my flesh </span>adds the more tender and gentle qualities.<p><span class= "bld">She shall be called Woman (Ishah), because she was taken out of Man (Ish).</span>--Adam, who knew that he was an Ish (see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>at end of this book), called the woman a "female Ish."

"The thrice repeated <span class="accented">this is</span> characteristic.
