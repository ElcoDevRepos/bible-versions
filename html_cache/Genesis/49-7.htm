Their anger is described as "strong," indicating its intensity and the lack of control they exhibited. The curse highlights the destructive nature of unchecked anger, which is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a>; <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>). The strength of their anger led to actions that were not only excessive but also dishonorable, reflecting a failure to uphold justice in a righteous manner.<p><b>and their wrath, for it is cruel!</b><br>The term "wrath" here emphasizes the fierce and vengeful nature of their actions. The cruelty of their wrath is evident in the massacre of the men of Shechem, which went beyond justice to an act of vengeance. This cruelty is condemned, as it reflects a heart that is not aligned with God's character of mercy and justice (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The Bible consistently warns against cruelty and vengeance, urging believers to leave room for God's justice (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><b>I will disperse them in Jacob</b><br>This part of the prophecy foretells the future of the tribes of Simeon and Levi. Historically, the tribe of Simeon was absorbed into the territory of Judah, losing its distinct identity (<a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>). The dispersion in Jacob signifies a loss of unity and influence among the tribes of Israel. This dispersion can be seen as a consequence of their earlier actions, reflecting the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>and scatter them in Israel.</b><br>The tribe of Levi, unlike Simeon, was scattered throughout Israel in a different manner. The Levites were set apart for religious duties and given no specific territory of their own (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Instead, they were distributed among the other tribes, serving in the Tabernacle and later the Temple. This scattering fulfilled Jacob's prophecy but also turned into a blessing, as the Levites became the spiritual leaders of Israel. This transformation from a curse to a blessing illustrates God's redemptive power and foreshadows the role of Christ as our High Priest, who intercedes for us (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is giving his final blessings and prophecies to his sons in <a href="/bsb/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon_and_levi.htm">Simeon and Levi</a></b><br>Sons of Jacob and Leah, whose anger and violence are being addressed in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation that Jacob's descendants will become, representing the collective tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The event that led to this curse was the violent retaliation by Simeon and Levi against the city of Shechem, as recounted in <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/blessing_of_jacob.htm">Blessing of Jacob</a></b><br>The larger context of <a href="/bsb/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>, where Jacob blesses his sons, each with a prophetic statement about their future.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_anger.htm">The Consequences of Anger</a></b><br>Anger, when unchecked, can lead to destructive actions that have long-lasting consequences.

Scripture treats anger as a heart&#8211;issue that brings God&#8217;s disapproval (<a href="/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>). Here the patriarch calls down a curse&#8212;not on the men&#8217;s existence, but on the sinful passion that drove them. That distinction reminds us that God may redeem sinners while still condemning the sin (e.g., <a href="/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it is strong</b><p>Their anger wasn&#8217;t a passing irritation; it was potent, dominating, and unchecked. Jacob&#8217;s wording echoes <a href="/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>, &#8220;Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood,&#8221; underscoring how overpowering emotions can drown out wisdom (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19-20</a>). By labeling their anger &#8220;strong,&#8221; Jacob shows that its very intensity made it dangerous to themselves and to others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their wrath, for it is cruel!</b><p>Cruel wrath inflicts needless pain. Simeon and Levi killed innocent townsmen and looted their city&#8212;acts that went far beyond justice (<a href="/genesis/34-28.htm">Genesis 34:28-29</a>). The phrase &#8220;cruel&#8221; points to the brutality of sin when self-control is absent (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>). God consistently condemns violence born of vengeance (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will disperse them in Jacob</b><p>The judgment is prophetic: Simeon&#8217;s allotted territory would later be swallowed up inside Judah&#8217;s borders (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>), and many Simeonites would migrate north or fade into other tribes (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). Levi received no unified land at all; instead, forty-eight priestly cities were sprinkled throughout Israel (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1-3</a>). The dispersion fulfilled Jacob&#8217;s words while also curbing future outbreaks of family-wide violence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and scatter them in Israel</b><p>Scattering proved double-edged. For Simeon the dispersion led to loss of tribal prominence (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-38.htm">1 Chronicles 4:38-43</a>). For Levi, God transformed the sentence into a blessing: their scattering positioned them to teach His law nationwide (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-10</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-4.htm">Malachi 2:4-7</a>). God&#8217;s sovereignty can redeem discipline into ministry, yet the original warning stands&#8212;unrestrained wrath carries lasting consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a> shows Jacob, under divine inspiration, condemning the fierce and cruel anger displayed by Simeon and Levi. Because their wrath overran justice, God decreed that their descendants would be dispersed throughout Israel. History records the literal fulfillment: Simeon was absorbed, Levi was assigned priestly cities, and neither tribe held a consolidated territory. The passage affirms that unchecked anger invites judgment, yet it also reveals God&#8217;s ability to weave even disciplinary scattering into His larger redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Cursed . . . --</span>Jacob condemns Simeon and Levi not because they were angry, but because they vented their anger in a perfidious and violent manner. The next sentence literally is, <span class= "ital">And their rage, for it was hard. </span>The indignation at Joseph's dreams, told them by him innocently, led them to an act harsh and in human (see <a href="/genesis/42-21.htm" title="And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he sought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come on us.">Genesis 42:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I will divide them . . . --</span>This prediction was equally fulfilled in the fact that neither of the tribes of Simeon and Levi possessed any political importance in Israel. The brothers had banded together to oppress their kindred; their descendants were powerless. But in every other respect the fulfilment was utterly diverse. In the wilderness the Simeonites dwindled from 59,300 to 22,200 men (<a href="/numbers/1-23.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.">Numbers 1:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-14.htm" title="These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 26:14</a>); and after the conquest of Canaan, were so feeble as to have only fifteen towns assigned them, scattered about in the territory of Judah. And there they melted away, being either absorbed into the tribe among whom they dwelt, crwithdrawing to wander as nomads in the wilderness of Paran. In Levi's case the curse was changed into a blessing by the faithfulness of the tribe upon a very trying occasion (<a href="/context/exodus/32-26.htm" title="Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.">Exodus 32:26-28</a>); and we learn from it the great lesson that the Divine rewards and punishments, even when specified in prophecy, are nevertheless conditional upon human conduct. Of this diversity of fulfilment there is not the slightest indication in Jacob's blessing, while in that of Moses the lot of Levi is described in terms of the highest praise, and that of Simeon is passed over in inglorious silence.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/49-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Cursed [be]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;r&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_779.htm">Strong's 779: </a> </span><span class="str2">To execrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their anger,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#183;p&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
