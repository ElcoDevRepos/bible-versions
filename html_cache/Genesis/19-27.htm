In biblical times, early morning was often a time for prayer and seeking God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>. It reflects Abraham's commitment to his relationship with God and his concern for the events unfolding in Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>Abraham got up</b><br>Abraham's rising signifies his proactive nature and leadership. It shows his readiness to engage with God and the situation at hand. This action can be seen as a model of faithfulness and responsibility, as Abraham consistently seeks God's presence and guidance.<p><b>and returned to the place</b><br>The specific mention of returning to a place suggests a deliberate action. This place holds significance as it is where Abraham previously interceded for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>). It highlights the importance of sacred spaces in one's spiritual journey and the practice of returning to places of divine encounter.<p><b>where he had stood before the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal relationship and direct communication Abraham had with God. Standing before the LORD indicates a position of reverence and intercession. It connects to the broader biblical theme of standing in God's presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where Moses spoke to God face to face. This encounter foreshadows the ultimate mediator, Jesus Christ, who stands before God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Like David who said, &#8220;In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>), Abraham rises at dawn, teaching the value of promptly seeking God.<p>&#8226; Morning hours often mark decisive moments in Scripture&#8212;think of Israel gathering manna at daybreak (<a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>) or Jesus praying &#8220;while it was still dark&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase hints that Abraham had spent a sleepless night, burdened for Lot and the cities (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abraham got up</b><p>&#8226; Action follows concern. Faith is never passive; it moves our feet (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing up signifies readiness to witness whatever God has done, echoing Moses who &#8220;rose early&#8221; before the battle with Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; His rising also models perseverance&#8212;he interceded the previous day; now he continues in watchfulness (<a href="/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And returned</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Returned&#8221; points to consistency. Abraham revisits the very ground where he communed with God, illustrating steadfast spiritual habits (<a href="/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a>).<p>&#8226; Returning implies expectation. Like Elijah who sent his servant back seven times to look for rain (<a href="/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43</a>), Abraham anticipates a visible answer to his prayers.<p>&#8226; It also reflects responsibility; intercession is not abandoned once words are spoken (<a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the place</b><p>&#8226; Places matter in Scripture. Jacob later names Bethel because &#8220;surely the LORD is in this place&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This location was Abraham&#8217;s altar of intercession in <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22</a>; he treats it as a spiritual checkpoint.<p>&#8226; Designated sacred spaces help anchor our memories of God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where he had stood before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Stood&#8221; recalls the posture of an advocate. Abraham had &#8220;drawn near&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) and pleaded for mercy&#8212;an Old Testament glimpse of priestly ministry (<a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; shows direct access, a privilege echoed later: &#8220;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures us that God welcomes dialogue; Abraham&#8217;s earlier conversation was not a monologue but a real exchange (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a> portrays a man of faith who rises early, acts decisively, revisits the place of prayer, and stands expectantly before God.
