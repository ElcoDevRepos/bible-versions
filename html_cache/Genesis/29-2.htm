They were often located in fields where shepherds could easily access water for their flocks. Wells also served as communal gathering places, which is significant in biblical narratives. This well in the field is reminiscent of other biblical encounters at wells, such as those involving Rebekah and Moses, symbolizing divine providence and guidance.<p><b>and near it lay three flocks of sheep</b><br>Sheep were a primary source of livelihood in the ancient Near East, providing wool, milk, and meat. The presence of three flocks suggests a communal use of the well, indicating cooperation among shepherds. This scene sets the stage for Jacob's interaction with Rachel, as it was common for shepherds to gather at wells to water their flocks, facilitating social interactions and alliances.<p><b>because the sheep were watered from this well</b><br>Watering sheep was a daily necessity, and wells were strategically important for sustaining life. This phrase highlights the well's role in the community's daily routine. It also underscores the importance of water in biblical symbolism, often representing life, sustenance, and spiritual refreshment. The act of watering sheep can be seen as a metaphor for God's provision and care for His people.<p><b>And a large stone covered the mouth of the well</b><br>The large stone covering the well's mouth served to protect the water supply from contamination and unauthorized use. It required significant effort to move, often necessitating the cooperation of several people. This detail foreshadows Jacob's strength and determination, as he later moves the stone himself to water Rachel's flock. The stone can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "living water" and the one who removes obstacles to spiritual nourishment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is on a journey to find a wife from his mother's family.

When the text says, &#8220;He looked and saw a well in the field,&#8221; it grounds the scene in a real, physical place. Scripture often uses wells as divine meeting points&#8212;think of Eliezer praying at a well for Isaac&#8217;s bride (<a href="/genesis/24-11.htm">Genesis 24:11&#8211;15</a>) or Jesus speaking with the Samaritan woman at Jacob&#8217;s well (<a href="/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6&#8211;14</a>). Each time, God moves His plan forward in everyday surroundings. Here, Jacob&#8217;s first view of the well signals that God&#8217;s providence is already at work in the ordinary landscape of a field, just as <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a> speaks of the Shepherd leading His sheep beside &#8220;still waters.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Near it lay three flocks of sheep</b><p>The detail of &#8220;three flocks&#8221; shows purposeful order, not random chance. In Scripture, flocks represent provision and stewardship (<a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>; <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3&#8211;4</a>). The gathered sheep hint that Jacob is about to step into a pastoral life mirroring his father Isaac and grandfather Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2, 5</a>). It also foreshadows Jacob&#8217;s future increase in livestock (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>). By describing multiple flocks, the text quietly underscores community&#8212;several shepherds sharing one resource&#8212;revealing how God often brings people together around His provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the sheep were watered from this well</b><p>Water is life in the ancient Near East, and the phrase points to a habitual, trustworthy source. Just as God repeatedly provided water for Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>), here He sustains the flocks through this single well. For Jacob, the consistency of the well&#8217;s water becomes an early sign that the Lord, who promised &#8220;I am with you and will watch over you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>), can be trusted to meet his needs in a foreign land. It also illustrates a rhythm of work and rest: the sheep graze, then gather for refreshment&#8212;echoing the divine pattern of labor followed by renewal (<a href="/exodus/20-9.htm">Exodus 20:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And a large stone covered the mouth of the well</b><p>The &#8220;large stone&#8221; introduces tension. Water is available, yet temporarily inaccessible. This sets the stage for Jacob&#8217;s physical strength to shine when he later rolls the stone away single-handedly (<a href="/genesis/29-10.htm">Genesis 29:10</a>), hinting at God-given ability (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). It also pictures obstacles that appear to block God&#8217;s blessings until He chooses the right moment to remove them, much like the stone that sealed Jesus&#8217; tomb before the Resurrection (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>; 28:2). The covering protects the water from contamination and misuse, emphasizing stewardship and timing&#8212;truths echoed when <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a> urges us to guard the wellspring of our hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a> anchors Jacob&#8217;s arrival in Haran with vivid, literal details: a well in a field, three flocks awaiting water, and a heavy stone guarding the source. Each element reveals God&#8217;s faithful provision, His orchestration of community, and His perfect timing in removing barriers. The verse reassures believers that even in unfamiliar territory, the Lord continues to guide, supply, and protect, turning ordinary settings into stages for His unfolding plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Behold a well in the field.</span>--This was not the well whence Rebekah drew the water; for it was in the field, the open pasture ground, whereas Rebekah's well was just outside the city (<a href="/genesis/24-11.htm" title="And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.">Genesis 24:11</a>), and she obtained the water by going down the steps which led to it (<a href="/genesis/24-16.htm" title="And the damsel was very fair to look on, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.">Genesis 24:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A great stone was upon the well's mouth.</span>--The region round Haran, though fertile, is very dry, and the chief use of the stone was to prevent the well from being choked with sand. As the proper translation is <span class= "ital">the stone upon the well's mouth was great, </span>it would also serve to prevent the well from being used, except at fixed times; for it probably required the strength of two or three men (comp. Robinson, <span class= "ital">Bibl. Res. </span>ii. 180) to remove it; nor does the language of <a href="/genesis/29-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.">Genesis 29:10</a> necessarily imply that Jacob rolled it away without the aid of others. Besides this, the stone may have marked that the well was private property: for, as we have seen in the account of the covenants of Abraham and Isaac with Abimelech, no possession was morevalued than that of wells. And as we find the shepherds all waiting for Rachel, and that immediately on her arrival the stone is rolled away, and her sheep watered first, while the rest, though they had been there long before her, yet have to bide their time till her wants are supplied, it is probable that Laban had at least a first claim upon its enjoyment. No such courtesy was shown to the daughters of Jethro (<a href="/exodus/2-17.htm" title="And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.">Exodus 2:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he looked</span> (either to discover where he was, or in search of water), <span class="cmt_word">and behold a well in the field</span>, - not the well at which Eliezer's caravan halted, which was a well for the village maidens, situated in front of the town, and approached by steps (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.), but a well in the open field for the use of flocks, and covered at the time of Jacob's arrival with a huge stone - <span class="cmt_word">and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it.</span> A frequent Oriental scene (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-11.htm">Genesis 14:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>). "Who that has traveled much in this country has not often arrived at a well in the heat of the day which was surrounded with numerous flocks of sheep waiting to be watered? I once saw such a scene in the burning plains of Northern Syria. Half-naked, fierce-looking men were drawing up water in leather buckets; flock after flock was brought up, watered, and sent away; and after all the men had ended their work, then several women and girls brought up their flocks, and drew water for them. Thus it was with Jethro's daughters; and thus, no doubt, it would have been with Rachel if Jacob had not rolled away the stone and watered her sheep" ('Land and Book,' p. 589). <span class="cmt_word">For out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.</span> "Most of the cisterns are covered with a large thick, flat stone, in the center of which a hole is cut, which forms the mouth of the cistern. This hole, in many instances, we found covered with a heavy stone, to the removal of which two or three men were requisite" (Robinson, 2. p. 180). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/29-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He looked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
