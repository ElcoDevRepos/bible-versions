Joseph was favored by their father, Jacob, which fueled their resentment. This act of plotting murder highlights the severity of their hatred. In biblical context, this mirrors the story of Cain and Abel, where jealousy led to fratricide. It also foreshadows the rejection and eventual crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was also despised by those He came to save.<p><b>and throw him into one of the pits.</b><br>The "pits" refer to cisterns or dry wells common in the region, used to collect rainwater. These pits were often deep and difficult to escape from, making them suitable for imprisoning someone. This act of casting Joseph into a pit symbolizes the depths of betrayal and abandonment. It prefigures Christ's descent into the grave and His subsequent resurrection, as Joseph's eventual rise to power in Egypt mirrors Christ's victory over death.<p><b>We can say that a vicious animal has devoured him.</b><br>This deception planned by Joseph's brothers is significant in its attempt to cover up their sin. The use of a "vicious animal" as an excuse is ironic, as it reflects their own beastly behavior. This lie parallels the deceit of Satan, the "father of lies," and the false accusations brought against Jesus. It also underscores the theme of sin leading to further sin, as the brothers' initial jealousy spirals into a web of deceit.<p><b>Then we shall see what becomes of his dreams!</b><br>Joseph's dreams, which foretold his rise to prominence and his brothers bowing to him, were a source of their envy. This statement is filled with sarcasm and disbelief, as the brothers sought to thwart God's revealed plan. However, their actions inadvertently set the stage for the fulfillment of those dreams. This reflects the biblical principle that God's purposes prevail despite human opposition, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.
