The use of goats is significant in biblical symbolism, often representing sin and atonement, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> with the scapegoat ritual. The choice of two goats may also foreshadow the later sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law. This act of obtaining the goats is a pivotal moment in the fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where the older would serve the younger.<p><b>and brought them to his mother</b><br>Jacob's obedience to Rebekah highlights the strong matriarchal influence in the family dynamics. This action underscores the theme of family loyalty and the complexities of parental favoritism, as Rebekah favors Jacob over Esau. The cultural context of the time placed significant weight on the mother's role in household affairs, and Rebekah's involvement is crucial in the unfolding of God's plan for Jacob.<p><b>who made the tasty food</b><br>Rebekah's preparation of the meal is a deliberate act to deceive Isaac, who is old and blind. The "tasty food" is meant to mimic Esau's cooking, as Esau was known for his skill in hunting and preparing game. This deception is a critical turning point in the narrative, leading to Jacob receiving Isaac's blessing. The act of preparing food is also a recurring motif in Scripture, often associated with covenantal meals and significant events, such as the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>.<p><b>his father loved</b><br>Isaac's love for the food prepared by Esau is indicative of his favoritism towards Esau, which contrasts with Rebekah's preference for Jacob. This favoritism sets the stage for the conflict between the brothers and the subsequent blessing of Jacob. The phrase also reflects the human tendency to be swayed by physical desires and preferences, a theme that recurs throughout the Bible. Isaac's love for the food symbolizes the broader theme of the struggle between fleshly desires and spiritual promises, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is involved in the deception of his father to receive the blessing meant for Esau.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The mother of Jacob and Esau, who orchestrates the plan for Jacob to receive Isaac's blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The father of Jacob and Esau, who is old and blind, and intends to bless Esau.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is the intended recipient of Isaac's blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deception.htm">The Deception</a></b><br>The event where Jacob, guided by Rebekah, deceives Isaac to receive the blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Deception, even with seemingly good intentions, leads to broken relationships and long-term consequences.

Quick obedience stands out here; Scripture often links prompt action with trust, as when Abraham &#8220;rose early&#8221; to obey God (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) or when the disciples &#8220;left their nets at once&#8221; to follow Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>). Jacob&#8217;s readiness, however, is colored by the moral tension of the plan. While acting swiftly, he is stepping into deception&#8212;echoing the truth that our choices can be both decisive and flawed (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and got two goats</b><p>Rebekah specifies &#8220;two choice young goats&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-9.htm">Genesis 27:9</a>). This detail signals:<p>&#8226; Provision: Jacob already has what Rebekah needs within the flock, reminding us that God often equips before calling (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Symbolism: Goats later figure prominently in atonement ritual (<a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7&#8211;10</a>). Though this scene is not sacrificial, it foreshadows the idea of substitution&#8212;one life standing in for another, just as Jacob will stand in for Esau.<p>&#8226; Practicality: Two goats yield enough meat to mimic Esau&#8217;s wild game, showing Rebekah&#8217;s meticulous planning (compare <a href="/genesis/27-16.htm">Genesis 27:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brought them to his mother</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s delivery marks a teamwork in deception. The text states, &#8220;He brought them to his mother&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-14.htm">Genesis 27:14</a>), highlighting:<p>&#8226; Family influence: Parents shape children&#8217;s actions, for good or ill (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>). Rebekah guides Jacob as Eve guided Adam (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Complicity: Jacob cannot claim ignorance; carrying the goats makes him an active participant (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment of promise: Despite flawed methods, God&#8217;s earlier word that &#8220;the older shall serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) is moving toward fulfillment, illustrating His sovereignty even through human weakness (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who made the tasty food his father loved</b><p>Rebekah prepares a meal that matches Isaac&#8217;s palate, exploiting his senses of taste and smell (<a href="/genesis/27-17.htm">Genesis 27:17, 27</a>). Key insights:<p>&#8226; Sensory appeal: Isaac&#8217;s preference for game influenced his judgment (<a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>); this meal underscores how appetite can cloud discernment (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Deception executed: The dish becomes the vehicle of the ruse, reminding us that sin often disguises itself in what feels pleasant (<a href="/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Maternal ingenuity: Rebekah&#8217;s culinary skill accomplishes her goal, yet Scripture later records the heartache that follows (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41&#8211;45</a>), showing that results gained deceitfully carry painful fallout (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-14.htm">Genesis 27:14</a> captures a son&#8217;s swift compliance, a mother&#8217;s calculated plan, and a meal tailored to manipulate.
