The Hivites were one of the groups that Israel would later encounter during the conquest of Canaan. Shechem's position as "the prince of the region" indicates his significant social and political status, suggesting that his actions would have had considerable implications for the surrounding community. This setting in the land of Canaan is crucial, as it highlights the cultural and moral differences between the Canaanites and the family of Jacob, who were called to be set apart.<p><b>saw her,</b><br>The act of seeing in biblical narratives often precedes a significant action or decision. In this context, Shechem's seeing Dinah can be compared to other instances in Scripture where seeing leads to desire and subsequent sin, such as Eve seeing the forbidden fruit or David seeing Bathsheba. This phrase sets the stage for the unfolding events, emphasizing the initial moment of temptation and desire.<p><b>he took her</b><br>The phrase "he took her" implies an act of forceful possession, which is consistent with the cultural practices of the time where women had limited autonomy and were often treated as property. This action reflects the patriarchal society in which the narrative is set, where men of power could exert their will over others, particularly women, without immediate consequence. It also foreshadows the later laws given to Israel, which would seek to protect the vulnerable and uphold justice.<p><b>and lay with her by force.</b><br>This phrase explicitly describes the act of sexual violence committed against Dinah. The use of force indicates a violation of her person and dignity, highlighting the grave sin committed by Shechem. This act of defilement is significant within the biblical narrative, as it not only affects Dinah but also sets off a chain of events leading to the violent retaliation by her brothers, Simeon and Levi. The incident underscores the themes of justice and retribution found throughout Scripture. It also serves as a stark contrast to the biblical ideal of consensual and covenantal relationships, as exemplified in the marriage of Adam and Eve or the love between Christ and the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>- The son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the land.
