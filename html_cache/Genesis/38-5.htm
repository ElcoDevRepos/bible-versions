The birth of another son signifies the importance of family and lineage in the biblical narrative, particularly in the context of the tribes of Israel. The birth of sons was often seen as a blessing and a means of ensuring the continuation of one's family line, which was crucial in the ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>and named him Shelah;</b><br>The naming of Shelah is significant as names in the Bible often carry deep meanings or reflect circumstances surrounding the birth. Shelah would become the progenitor of the Shelanites, a clan within the tribe of Judah. The name Shelah may be related to the Hebrew word for "petition" or "request," possibly indicating a prayer or hope associated with his birth. This highlights the cultural importance of names and their meanings in biblical times.<p><b>it was at Chezib</b><br>Chezib, also known as Achzib, is a location in the territory of Judah. It is mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>, where it is referred to as a place of deception. The mention of Chezib provides geographical context and situates the narrative within the land that would later be part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. Archaeological evidence suggests that Chezib was a significant settlement during the time of the patriarchs.<p><b>that she gave birth to him.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the specific location of Shelah's birth, which may have implications for his identity and future role within the tribe of Judah. The mention of the place of birth can also be seen as a way to authenticate the historical and geographical accuracy of the biblical narrative. The birth of Shelah at Chezib ties into the broader theme of God's providence and the unfolding of His plan through the lineage of Judah, which ultimately leads to the birth of Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shelah.htm">Shelah</a></b><br>The third son of Judah and his wife, the daughter of Shua.

Her third childbirth highlights the continuing growth of Judah&#8217;s household, a family line God will use even through messy circumstances. Scripture often pauses to mark each birth in the patriarchal stories&#8212;see the catalog of sons in <a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31&#8211;30</a>:24 or later in <a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a> where another key birth moves the redemptive plan forward. In every case God is quietly steering history toward His promised Messiah (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and named him Shelah</b><p>Naming in Genesis usually carries purpose. While the text does not spell out why &#8220;Shelah&#8221; was chosen, the simple act shows parental authority and God-given identity, just as when Leah names Judah (<a href="/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>) or when Hannah names Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>). Shelah will become head of the Shelanite clan (<a href="/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>) and appear again in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21</a>, proving that God preserves even the lesser-known branches of the covenant family tree. Later, Judah&#8217;s failure to give Shelah to Tamar (<a href="/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>,14) will expose sin in Judah&#8217;s heart, but Shelah himself stands as a continuing testimony that God&#8217;s plans are bigger than human failure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it was at Chezib</b><p>Chezib (also called Achzib) lies in the lowlands of Judah&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>). The verse quietly notes geography, anchoring the story in real space and time&#8212;just as earlier narratives mark Beersheba (<a href="/genesis/26-33.htm">Genesis 26:33</a>) or Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). <a href="/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a> later mentions Achzib in a lament, showing the town&#8217;s ongoing place in Israel&#8217;s landscape. By telling us Shelah&#8217;s birthplace, Moses affirms historical detail and foreshadows Judah&#8217;s eventual settlement in this very region (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that she gave birth to him</b><p>The repetition underscores certainty: the child was undeniably Judah&#8217;s, born to his wife, completing a trio of sons. Scripture often doubles down on key facts&#8212;compare &#8220;Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-2.htm">Genesis 21:2</a>) or &#8220;Rachel conceived and bore Joseph&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-23.htm">Genesis 30:23&#8211;24</a>). Here the Spirit seals the record so later readers will see God&#8217;s faithfulness even when Judah&#8217;s behavior soon turns shameful (<a href="/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12&#8211;26</a>). Shelah&#8217;s existence keeps alive the legal requirement for Judah to provide Tamar with a husband (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5&#8211;6</a>), setting the stage for the dramatic resolution that follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a> is more than a passing footnote. It marks the birth of Judah&#8217;s third son, Shelah, pinpoints the location at Chezib, and quietly threads Shelah into the larger tapestry of God&#8217;s covenant story. Each clause assures us that the Lord records every detail, preserves every lineage, and advances His redemptive plan&#8212;even through ordinary births and flawed people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Chezib.</span>--Mr. Conder has found traces of this place at <span class= "ital">Ain Kezbeh, </span>near Beit Nettif, a little to the north of Adullam (<span class= "ital">Handbook, </span>p. 408).
