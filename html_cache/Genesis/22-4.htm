This pattern is seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who rose on the third day, signifying victory over death. The three-day journey also emphasizes the gravity and deliberation of Abraham's obedience to God's command, allowing time for reflection and faith.<p><b>Abraham looked up</b><br>This phrase indicates a moment of realization and divine guidance. Abraham's act of looking up can be seen as an expression of faith and readiness to receive God's direction. It parallels other biblical moments where looking up signifies seeking or receiving divine insight, such as when Jesus looks up to heaven before performing miracles.<p><b>and saw the place</b><br>The "place" refers to Mount Moriah, which holds significant theological and historical importance. It is traditionally identified with the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, where Solomon later built the temple. This location becomes a central site for worship and sacrifice in Israel's history, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<p><b>in the distance</b><br>The distance underscores the journey of faith and the perseverance required to fulfill God's commands. It also highlights the prophetic nature of the event, as Abraham's journey to Moriah prefigures the journey of Christ to the cross. The distance can symbolize the separation between humanity and God, bridged by acts of faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

He kept walking three days with Isaac, fully intending to worship as God required (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording foreshadows the climactic &#8220;third day&#8221; when Christ rose (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). Just as Abraham would receive Isaac back &#8220;figuratively&#8221; from death (<a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>), the Father would literally raise His Son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abraham looked up</b><p>&#8226; After miles of focused travel, Abraham lifts his eyes&#8212;an act that often precedes fresh revelation (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>; <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Looking up reminds us where help comes from: &#8220;I lift up my eyes to the mountains&#8212;where does my help come from?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>).

On the third day, Abraham lifts his eyes, recognizes God&#8217;s chosen mountain, and presses on, even though the destination still lies ahead. The verse models how obedient faith keeps moving toward promises glimpsed from afar and foreshadows the ultimate third-day deliverance accomplished by Christ on the same ridge of Moriah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">On the third day.</span>--We may compare the patriarch's feelings during these two weary days of travel with those of Hagar as she wandered in the wilderness, and each day felt the death of her child growing nearer and more certain.

Hence it has been argued that some more widely conspicuous hill-top must be meant. But the phrase <span class= "ital">afar off </span>is used very indefinitely, and three miles exactly agrees with what Abraham did. For he left the servants at the spot, and laid the wood on Isaac, and went the rest of the way on foot. It must have sorely taxed the strength of the lad to be compelled to carry the wood a distance of three miles; while to have carried it from the spot where Gerizim becomes visible would have been impossible.<p>In Isaac thus carrying the wood on which he was to be sacrificed, the Fathers discerned a type of Christ carrying his cross (<a href="/john/19-17.htm" title="And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:">John 19:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then on the third day</span> - Jerusalem, being distant from Beersheba about twenty and a half hours' journey according to Robinson, could easily; be within sight on the third day - <span class="cmt_word">Abraham lifted up his eyes</span>, - not implying that the object of vision was above him (cf. <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and saw the place</span> (which Calvin conjectures he had previously beheld in vision) <span class="cmt_word">afar off</span>.
