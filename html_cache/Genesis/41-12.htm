The term "Hebrew" is significant as it connects Joseph to the lineage of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing his identity as part of God's chosen people. The mention of Joseph being "young" highlights his youthfulness and perhaps his perceived inexperience, which contrasts with the wisdom he demonstrates. This setting is in Egypt, where Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers, a foreign land where Hebrews were not common, underscoring his outsider status.<p><b>a servant of the captain of the guard</b><br>Joseph's position as a servant to Potiphar, the captain of the guard, is crucial. This role places him in a position of influence despite his status as a slave. Potiphar's household would have been part of the Egyptian elite, providing Joseph with exposure to Egyptian culture and administration. This experience is part of God's providential plan, preparing Joseph for future leadership. The captain of the guard's position also suggests a connection to Pharaoh, which becomes significant as the narrative progresses.<p><b>We told him our dreams</b><br>Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered messages from the divine. Joseph's ability to interpret dreams is a gift from God, setting him apart and foreshadowing his rise to power. This ability is a recurring theme in Joseph's life, as seen earlier with his own dreams and later with Pharaoh's. The act of sharing dreams indicates a level of trust and desperation, as the dreamers seek understanding and guidance.<p><b>and he interpreted them for us individually</b><br>Joseph's interpretations are personalized, demonstrating his discernment and the accuracy of his gift. This individual attention highlights the personal nature of God's revelations and the care with which Joseph approaches his task. The successful interpretation of these dreams establishes Joseph's credibility and sets the stage for his introduction to Pharaoh. This moment is a turning point, as it leads to Joseph's eventual elevation to a position of power, fulfilling God's promises to him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man, known for his ability to interpret dreams.
