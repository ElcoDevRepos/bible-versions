Peleg's name, meaning "division," is significant as it is associated with the division of the earth, possibly referring to the dispersion at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>). This division marks a pivotal moment in human history, where God intervened to scatter humanity across the earth, fulfilling His command to fill the earth (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>).<p><b>Eber lived 430 years</b><br>Eber's lifespan reflects the gradual decrease in human longevity post-Flood, a trend seen throughout Genesis. This decrease may symbolize the increasing effects of sin on creation. Eber's long life allowed him to witness significant events, including the Tower of Babel, and to pass down knowledge and traditions to subsequent generations. His lifespan also connects him to the patriarchal narratives, bridging the antediluvian and postdiluvian worlds.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates the continuation of Eber's lineage beyond Peleg, suggesting a broader family network that contributed to the growth of nations. The mention of "other sons and daughters" highlights the fulfillment of God's command to multiply and fill the earth. It also underscores the importance of family and community in the biblical narrative, as these descendants would have played roles in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. The genealogical records in Genesis serve to trace the lineage leading to Christ, emphasizing God's sovereignty in history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eber.htm">Eber</a></b><br>A descendant of Shem, Eber is an important figure in the genealogies of Genesis.

Each birth advances the messianic line promised in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eber lived 430 years</b><p>&#8226; Post-Flood lifespans are declining from antediluvian lengths, yet 430 years still demonstrate God&#8217;s sustaining grace.

Just as <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40-41</a> notes Israel&#8217;s 430 years in Egypt, specific figures invite confidence that God tracks time and history precisely.<p>&#8226; Eber&#8217;s lengthy life spans pivotal events: the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4-9</a>) and the scattering of nations.

It affirms a literal, populous growth that explains how nations quickly formed after the Flood (<a href="/genesis/10-32.htm">Genesis 10:32</a>).<p>&#8226; While the spotlight stays on the line leading to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26</a>) and ultimately Christ, the wider family circle illustrates God&#8217;s inclusive care for all peoples.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-17.htm">Genesis 11:17</a> records real events about a real man. Eber fathers Peleg, lives 430 more years, and raises additional children.
