His interactions with Jacob are marked by cunning and manipulation, reflecting a broader theme of deceit that runs through Jacob's story. Laban's character is introduced earlier in Genesis when he welcomes Abraham's servant, who comes to find a wife for Isaac. This sets the stage for his later dealings with Jacob.<p><b>&#8220;Just because you are my relative</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern culture, family ties were significant, often dictating social and economic interactions. Laban acknowledges the familial relationship, which would typically imply mutual support and obligation. However, Laban's question suggests a transactional approach, indicating that he intends to formalize Jacob's labor through a contractual agreement rather than relying solely on kinship.<p><b>should you work for nothing?</b><br>This phrase highlights the expectation of fair compensation for labor, even among relatives. It reflects the broader biblical principle of fair treatment and justice in economic dealings, as seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, which prohibits withholding wages. Laban's question is rhetorical, setting the stage for negotiation, but it also foreshadows the complex and often exploitative relationship that will develop between him and Jacob.<p><b>Tell me what your wages should be.&#8221;</b><br>Laban's offer to let Jacob set his wages appears generous but is laden with ulterior motives. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to Jacob's agreement to work for seven years in exchange for Rachel's hand in marriage. The concept of wages and labor agreements is a recurring theme in Jacob's story, reflecting the broader biblical narrative of covenant and promise. This also prefigures the New Testament teaching on the laborer being worthy of his hire (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>). The negotiation of wages here sets the stage for the subsequent events of deception and fulfillment of God's promises in Jacob's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's mother, making him Jacob's uncle.
