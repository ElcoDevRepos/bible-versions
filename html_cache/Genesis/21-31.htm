This location is significant in biblical history as a site of covenant-making. Beersheba is situated in the southern part of Israel, marking the boundary of the Promised Land. It became a central location for the patriarchs, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Archaeological evidence suggests that Beersheba was an important settlement during the time of the patriarchs, with remains of ancient wells and fortifications.<p><b>because it was there that the two of them swore an oath</b><br>The "two of them" refers to Abraham and Abimelech, the king of Gerar. This oath was a formal agreement to settle a dispute over a well of water, which was a crucial resource in the arid region. The act of swearing an oath was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures to ensure peace and cooperation. This event highlights the importance of water rights and the establishment of peaceful relations between different groups. The oath at Beersheba also prefigures the concept of covenant, which is central to biblical theology and finds its ultimate fulfillment in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ. The swearing of oaths in the Bible often points to God's faithfulness and the seriousness of commitments made before Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who made a covenant with Abimelech at Beersheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The king of Gerar, who entered into a covenant with Abraham to ensure peaceful relations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beersheba.htm">Beersheba</a></b><br>The location where Abraham and Abimelech made their covenant, named for the oath sworn there.
