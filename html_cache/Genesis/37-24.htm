It reflects the culmination of their jealousy and animosity towards Joseph, which had been building due to his favored status with their father, Jacob, and his dreams that suggested he would rule over them (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>). This act of taking Joseph can be seen as a betrayal, similar to how Jesus was betrayed by Judas (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).<p><b>and threw him into the pit</b><br>The pit, or cistern, was likely a dry well or storage for water, common in the region. This act of throwing Joseph into the pit symbolizes rejection and abandonment. It foreshadows the suffering and isolation that Joseph would endure, paralleling the suffering of Christ, who was also rejected by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). The pit can also be seen as a metaphor for death and resurrection, as Joseph is later "raised" from the pit, akin to Christ's resurrection.<p><b>Now the pit was empty,</b><br>The emptiness of the pit emphasizes the severity of Joseph's situation. There was no water or sustenance, highlighting his vulnerability and the brothers' callousness. This emptiness can be seen as a symbol of desolation and despair, akin to the spiritual emptiness that humanity faces without God's intervention. It also underscores the miraculous nature of Joseph's eventual deliverance, as there was no natural means of escape.<p><b>with no water in it</b><br>The detail of the pit having no water is significant, as it indicates that Joseph was not only abandoned but also left without basic necessities for survival. Water is often symbolic of life and sustenance in the Bible (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), and its absence here underscores the dire nature of Joseph's predicament. This detail also serves to highlight God's providence, as Joseph's survival and eventual rise to power demonstrate God's sovereignty and faithfulness, even in seemingly hopeless situations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who was given a coat of many colors.
