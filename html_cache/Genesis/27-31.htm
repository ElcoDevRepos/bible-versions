The preparation of food was a significant cultural practice, often associated with hospitality and blessing. In the context of <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>, the preparation of a meal was part of the ritual for receiving a patriarchal blessing, which was a formal and binding act. The emphasis on "tasty food" highlights the importance of pleasing the senses, which was a key aspect of ancient Near Eastern customs.<p><b>brought it to his father</b><br>Esau's act of bringing the food to Isaac demonstrates his obedience and respect for his father, a value deeply ingrained in the patriarchal society of the time. This action also underscores the familial relationships and the importance of the father-son dynamic in the narrative. The act of bringing food to Isaac is a physical representation of Esau's desire to receive his father's blessing, which was a significant and life-altering event in the ancient world.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;My father, sit up and eat of your son&#8217;s game</b><br>Esau's address to Isaac as "my father" reflects the intimate and respectful relationship expected between a son and his father. The request for Isaac to "sit up" suggests that Isaac was in a reclining or resting position, possibly due to his old age and failing health. The mention of "your son&#8217;s game" refers to the wild game that Esau, a skilled hunter, was known for bringing home. This phrase highlights Esau's identity and role within the family as the hunter and provider, contrasting with Jacob's more domestic role.<p><b>so that you may bless me.&#8221;</b><br>The request for a blessing is central to this passage. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a father's blessing was not merely a wish for well-being but a prophetic declaration that carried spiritual and material implications. The blessing was believed to confer divine favor and establish the future trajectory of the recipient's life. Esau's desire for the blessing underscores its importance and the irreversible nature of such pronouncements, as seen later when Isaac realizes he has already blessed Jacob. This moment also foreshadows the tension between Esau and Jacob, which has broader implications for the narrative of Israel's history and God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, known for his skill in hunting.

Esau was at this time a man of mature age, being either fifty-seven or seventy-seven years old, and must have been acquainted with the heavenly oracle (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) that assigned the precedence in the theocratic line to Jacob. Zither, therefore, he must have supposed that his claim to the blessing was not thereby affected, or he was guilty of conniving at Isaac's scheme for resisting the Divine will. Indignation at Jacob's duplicity and baseness, combined with sympathy for Esau in his supposed wrongs, sometimes prevents a just appreciation of the exact position occupied by the latter in this extraordinary transaction. Instead of branding Jacob as a shameless deceiver, and hurling against his fair fame the most opprobrious epithets, may it not be that, remembering the previously-expressed will of Heaven, the real supplanter was Esau, who as an accomplice of his father was seeking secretly, unlawfully, and feloniously to appropriate to himself a blessing which had already been, not obscurely, designated as Jacob's? On this hypothesis the miserable craft of Jacob and Rebekah was a lighter crime than that of Isaac and Esau. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">too</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
