This act is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as when Jacob believed Joseph was dead (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>) and when Job experienced his great losses (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). In this context, the brothers' tearing of their clothes signifies their profound anguish and desperation upon discovering the silver cup in Benjamin's sack, fearing the consequences and the impact on their father, Jacob.<p><b>loaded their donkeys</b><br>Donkeys were common pack animals in the ancient world, used for transportation and carrying goods. The mention of donkeys highlights the brothers' readiness to return immediately to Joseph, indicating their urgency and the seriousness of the situation. This detail also reflects the historical and cultural context of the time, where donkeys were essential for travel and trade.<p><b>and returned to the city</b><br>The city referred to here is likely the Egyptian city where Joseph, as a high-ranking official, resided. This return marks a pivotal moment in the narrative, as the brothers must face Joseph and the potential consequences of the alleged theft. The city serves as the setting for the unfolding of God's providential plan, where Joseph's true identity will eventually be revealed. This return also foreshadows the reconciliation and restoration that will occur, aligning with the broader biblical theme of redemption and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who orchestrated the test of his brothers by placing a silver cup in Benjamin's sack.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>- The sons of Jacob, who are returning to Egypt after being accused of stealing Joseph's silver cup.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>- The youngest brother, in whose sack the silver cup was found, causing distress among the brothers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>- The land where Joseph is second in command and where the brothers have come to buy grain.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>- Refers to the city of Egypt where Joseph resides and where the brothers return to face the consequences of the alleged theft.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/expression_of_grief.htm">Expression of Grief</a></b><br>The act of tearing clothes in <a href="/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13</a> is a profound expression of grief and despair.

Tearing one&#8217;s garments in Scripture is a visible sign of deep grief, shock, or repentance (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-31.htm">2 Samuel 13:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Their shared sorrow shows that the family has moved from previous jealousy and division toward solidarity, especially in their concern for Benjamin.<p>&#8226; This outward act also reveals an inward realization of guilt. Remember, Joseph had overheard them confessing their sin regarding him (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21&#8211;22</a>). Now their anguish is even deeper as they face the potential loss of Benjamin, the new favorite of their father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Loaded their donkeys</b><p>&#8226; After tearing their clothes, they immediately prepare for the journey back. The donkeys that once carried grain for their families (<a href="/genesis/42-26.htm">Genesis 42:26</a>) now carry them back to face judgment.<p>&#8226; Obedience replaces deceit: instead of fleeing, they head straight toward accountability (contrast <a href="/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26&#8211;28</a>, when they sold Joseph and headed home).<p>&#8226; The loading implies intent to return fully, not halfway. They are ready to present themselves before the Egyptian authority, accepting whatever outcome God allows (cf. <a href="/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>, &#8220;If I am bereaved, I am bereaved&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Returned to the city</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;city&#8221; is Joseph&#8217;s seat of power in Egypt. By going back, they submit to earthly authority, yet ultimately to God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their return sets the stage for Joseph&#8217;s final test and eventual revelation (<a href="/genesis/45-1.htm">Genesis 45:1&#8211;3</a>). What looks like impending doom will soon become a demonstration of divine grace.<p>&#8226; This journey echoes the broader biblical theme of repentance leading to restoration (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13</a> captures a pivotal moment of collective repentance. The brothers&#8217; torn clothes reveal genuine sorrow; their loaded donkeys show deliberate submission; their return to the city demonstrates trust in God&#8217;s sovereign plan. What begins in grief will soon unfold into reconciliation, illustrating how God works through honest repentance to bring about His redemptive purposes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they all tore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7167.htm">Strong's 7167: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their clothes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;im&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8071.htm">Strong's 8071: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dress, a mantle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">loaded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1505;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6006.htm">Strong's 6006: </a> </span><span class="str2">To load, impose a, burden</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their donkeys,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2543.htm">Strong's 2543: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male ass</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1430;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;u&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the city.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/44-13.htm">OT Law: Genesis 44:13 Then they tore their clothes and every (Gen.
