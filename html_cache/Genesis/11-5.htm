It suggests a divine intervention, highlighting that God is not distant but intimately aware of human actions. The anthropomorphic language ("came down") is used to convey God's inspection and judgment. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God "comes down" to assess situations, such as in <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> when God comes down to deliver Israel from Egypt.<p><b>to see the city and the tower</b><br>The city and the tower refer to Babel, a symbol of human pride and rebellion against God. The tower, often associated with a ziggurat, was an architectural structure common in ancient Mesopotamia, intended to reach the heavens. This reflects humanity's attempt to assert independence and achieve greatness apart from God. The act of God "seeing" is reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>, where God investigates Sodom and Gomorrah, indicating a thorough examination before judgment.<p><b>that the sons of men were building</b><br>"Sons of men" underscores the human origin and effort behind the construction, contrasting divine creation with human ambition. This phrase highlights the collective human endeavor, emphasizing unity in rebellion. It connects to the broader biblical theme of humanity's fallen nature and the tendency to seek self-glorification. The construction of the tower can be seen as a type of human attempts to reach God through their own means, contrasting with the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the only way to God (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His personal involvement and authority over creation.

For Jehovah is described as a mighty king, who, hearing in His upper and heavenly dwelling of man's ambitious purpose, determines to go and inspect the work in person, that having seen, he may deal with the offenders justly. He views, therefore, "the city and the tower;" for the city was as important a portion of their purpose as the tower, or even more so. The tower, which, no doubt, was to be the citadel and protection of the city, was for the latter's sake to give the people a sense of strength and security. Having, then, inspected the tower and the city nestling round it, the Deity affirms that this centralisation is injurious to man's best interests, and must be counteracted by an opposite principle, namely, the tendency of mankind to make constant changes in language, and thereby to break up into different communities, kept permanently apart by the use of different tongues. At present "it is one people, and there is one lip to all of them, and this is what they begin to do," &c. Already there are thoughts among them of universal empire, and if thus the spread of mankind be hindered, and its division into numerous nations, each contributing its share to the progress and welfare of the world, be stopped, man will remain a poor debased creature, and will fail utterly in accomplishing the purpose for which he was placed upon earth. <span class= "ital">"Go </span>to," therefore, He says, in irony of their twice repeated phrase, "we will go down, and make their speech unintelligible to one another." Now, though there is no assertion of a miracle here, yet we may well believe that there was an extraordinary quickening of a natural law which existed from the first. This, however, is but a secondary question, and the main fact is the statement that the Divine means for counteracting man's ambitious and ever-recurring dream of universal sovereignty is the law of diversity of speech. In ancient times there was little to counteract this tendency, and each city and petty district had its own dialect, and looked with animosity upon its neighbours who differed from it in pronunciation, if not in vocabulary. In the present day there are counteracting influences; and great communities, by the use of the same Bible and <span class= "ital">the </span>possession of the same classical literature, may long continue to speak the same language. In days also when communication is so easy, not only do men travel much, but newspapers and serials published at the centre are dispersed to the most distant portions of the world. In old time it was not so, and probably Isaiah would not have been easily understood thirty miles from Jerusalem, nor Demosthenes a few leagues; from Athens. Without books or literature, a little-band of families wandering about with their cattle, with no communication with other tribes, would quickly modify both the grammar and the pronunciation of their language; and when, after a year or two, they revisited the tower, they would feel like foreigners in the new city, and quickly depart with the determination never to return. And to this day diversity of language is a powerful factor in keeping nations apart, or in preventing portions of the same kingdom from agreeing heartily together. And thus at Babel the first attempt to bind the human family into one whole came to an ignominious end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord came down</span>.
