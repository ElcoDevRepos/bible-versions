This reflects the biblical principle that one's character and actions should align with God's standards (<a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>). The concept of honesty is central to the covenant relationships seen throughout Scripture, such as God's covenant with Abraham, where faithfulness and integrity are key (<a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1-2</a>).<p><b>when you come to check on my wages in the future.</b><br>This phrase indicates a future accountability, a common theme in biblical narratives where actions are often evaluated over time (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The idea of wages and fair compensation is rooted in the Mosaic Law, which emphasizes just treatment of workers (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). Jacob's anticipation of Laban's inspection underscores the importance of transparency and trust in business dealings.<p><b>If I have any goats that are not speckled or spotted,</b><br>The specific mention of speckled or spotted goats relates to the agreement between Jacob and Laban, where Jacob would take the less desirable animals as his wages (<a href="/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a>). This reflects the cultural practices of animal husbandry in the ancient Near East, where markings on livestock were significant for ownership and breeding purposes. The distinct markings serve as a clear identifier, much like the distinctiveness of God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>or any lambs that are not dark-colored,</b><br>Dark-colored lambs were part of the agreed-upon wages for Jacob. The mention of color highlights the importance of physical characteristics in ancient livestock management. This can be seen as a metaphor for the separation of God's people, who are set apart by their distinctiveness (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The emphasis on color and markings also foreshadows the idea of being marked or sealed by God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>.<p><b>they will be considered stolen.&#8221;</b><br>The concept of theft is addressed in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>), underscoring the moral and ethical standards expected of God's people. Jacob's declaration that any deviation from the agreed terms would be considered theft highlights the seriousness of maintaining integrity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and righteousness, where God's people are called to live in a way that honors Him and respects others (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and husband to Leah and Rachel.
