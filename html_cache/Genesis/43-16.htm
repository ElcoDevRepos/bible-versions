This moment is significant as it fulfills the condition Joseph set for his brothers to prove their honesty (<a href="/genesis/42-15.htm">Genesis 42:15</a>). Benjamin's presence is crucial because he is the only other son of Rachel, Joseph's mother, and holds a special place in Joseph's heart. This reunion is a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting themes of reconciliation and family restoration.<p><b>he said to the steward of his house</b><br>Joseph's authority is evident as he commands his steward, reflecting his high status in Egypt. The steward, likely an Egyptian, would have been responsible for managing Joseph's household affairs, indicating Joseph's integration into Egyptian society while maintaining his Hebrew identity. This role of a steward is similar to Eliezer in Abraham's household (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), showing a continuity of household management practices.<p><b>Take these men to my house</b><br>Joseph's invitation to his brothers to dine at his house is an act of hospitality and a step towards reconciliation. In the ancient Near East, sharing a meal was a sign of peace and fellowship. This gesture contrasts with the brothers' previous fear of being accused as spies (<a href="/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9</a>), and it foreshadows the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity and the healing of familial bonds.<p><b>Slaughter an animal and prepare it</b><br>The preparation of a meal by slaughtering an animal indicates a special occasion. In the cultural context, such a meal would be reserved for honored guests. This act also reflects the importance of hospitality in ancient times, where sharing a meal was a significant social and religious event. The slaughtering of an animal can also be seen as a type of sacrificial offering, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, the Lamb of God.<p><b>for they shall dine with me at noon</b><br>Dining at noon suggests a formal and significant meal, as main meals were typically held in the evening. This timing emphasizes the importance Joseph places on this gathering. The act of dining together is a precursor to the eventual reconciliation and forgiveness that Joseph extends to his brothers, mirroring the forgiveness and restoration offered through Christ. The meal serves as a turning point in the narrative, leading to the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity and the fulfillment of God's plan for the family of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to power.

More than two decades after his own brothers sold him (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>), he finally beholds Benjamin, the only other son of Rachel (<a href="/genesis/35-24.htm">Genesis 35:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This sight confirms that the brothers have obeyed Joseph&#8217;s earlier command: &#8220;Bring your youngest brother to me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-20.htm">Genesis 42:20</a>). Their obedience opens the door for reconciliation.<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s heart is immediately stirred; earlier he &#8220;turned away from them and wept&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-24.htm">Genesis 42:24</a>), and later he will weep again (<a href="/genesis/45-14.htm">Genesis 45:14</a>). The emotional weight underscores the real, historical family drama unfolding in God&#8217;s providence.<p>&#8226; In a larger sense, Scripture often portrays recognition of a long-lost relative as the catalyst for restoration&#8212;think of Jacob and Esau meeting in <a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a> or the father embracing the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>.

The verse illustrates God&#8217;s faithful providence, the power of obedient response, and the pattern of redemptive hospitality that culminates in Christ&#8217;s invitation to dine forever at His table.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Slay.</span>--The charge of inaccuracy brought against the narrator, upon the supposition that the higher classes in Egypt, especially the priests, did not eat flesh, has been abundantly disproved, as the representations of feasts belonging to this period show that an abundance of animal food was consumed. Animals, moreover, sacred in one district were freely eaten in another. Generally the priests might eat the flesh of oxen and geese, but not mutton, pork or fish.

The assertion that the narrator is here guilty of an inaccuracy in representing Joseph as having animal food prepared for himself and his guests (Bohlen) is refuted by Herodotus (2:37, 40) and by Wilkinson ('Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>. pp. 22, 23, ed. 1878), who says that "beef and goose constituted the principal part of the animal food throughout Egypt," and that according to the sculptures "a considerable quantity of meat was served up at those repasts to which strangers were invited.' "Though there was scarcely an animal which was not held sacred in some province, there was, perhaps with the only exception of the cow, none which' was not killed and eaten in other parts of the land" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and make ready;
