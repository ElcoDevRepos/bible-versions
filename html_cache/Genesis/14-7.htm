It is often associated with the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites. Kadesh was a major encampment site for the Israelites and a place where Moses struck the rock to bring forth water (<a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>). The turning back to invade suggests a strategic military maneuver, indicating the importance of this location as a crossroads or a place of resources. Kadesh is also linked to the patriarchal narratives, as it is near the area where Hagar encountered the angel of the Lord (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>).<p><b>and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe often in conflict with Israel. They are descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>. Their territory was in the Negev, a desert region south of Canaan. The conquest of the Amalekite territory signifies a significant victory, as the Amalekites were known for their guerrilla warfare tactics and hostility towards Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>. This victory foreshadows future conflicts between Israel and the Amalekites, culminating in their eventual defeat under King Saul and King David (1 Samuel 15, <a href="/1_samuel/30.htm">1 Samuel 30</a>).<p><b>as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar</b><br>The Amorites were a prominent Canaanite people known for their fortified cities and influence in the region. Hazazon-tamar is identified with the area around En-gedi, near the Dead Sea. This location is significant for its strategic and fertile oasis, providing resources and a defensive position. The Amorites' presence here indicates their widespread influence and control over key areas in Canaan. The mention of their defeat highlights the extent of the military campaign and sets the stage for future Israelite interactions with the Amorites, including the conquest of Canaan under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5-10</a>). Hazazon-tamar is also noted in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a> as a place where Jehoshaphat faced a coalition of enemies, emphasizing its ongoing strategic importance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/en-mishpat.htm">En-mishpat (Kadesh)</a></b><br>A significant location in the biblical account, often associated with pivotal events in Israel's history.
