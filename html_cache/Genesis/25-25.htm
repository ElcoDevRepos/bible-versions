The description of Esau as "red" is significant, as it foreshadows his later association with Edom, a name derived from the Hebrew word for red. This connection is seen in <a href="/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>, where Esau is identified as the father of the Edomites. The color red may also symbolize Esau's passionate and impulsive nature, which is evident in his later life choices, such as selling his birthright for a meal (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>).<p><b>covered with hair like a fur coat</b><br>Esau's unusual hairiness at birth is noteworthy and sets him apart from his twin brother, Jacob. This physical characteristic is later used by Jacob and Rebekah to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the blessing intended for Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-11.htm">Genesis 27:11-23</a>). The description of Esau's hairiness also emphasizes his connection to the natural, untamed world, contrasting with Jacob's more domestic and refined nature. In a broader biblical context, hairiness can symbolize strength and virility, as seen in the story of Samson (Judges 16).<p><b>so they named him Esau</b><br>The name "Esau" is believed to be related to the Hebrew word for "hairy," reflecting his distinctive appearance at birth. Naming in the biblical context often carries prophetic or symbolic significance, and Esau's name foreshadows his future as a rugged outdoorsman and hunter (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>). The act of naming also highlights the parental role in shaping identity and destiny, a theme that recurs throughout the Bible. Esau's name and character contrast with his brother Jacob, whose name means "heel-grabber" or "supplanter," indicating the tension and rivalry that will define their relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Isaac and Rebekah, described as red and hairy at birth. His name, Esau, is derived from the Hebrew word "Esav," which is related to "asah," meaning "to do" or "to make," possibly indicating his robust and active nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The father of Esau and Jacob, son of Abraham and Sarah. Isaac's role as a patriarch is crucial in the continuation of God's covenant with Abraham.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The mother of Esau and Jacob, wife of Isaac. Her pregnancy was marked by a divine revelation that the older son would serve the younger, setting the stage for future events.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Esau's twin brother, who was born immediately after him. Jacob's name, meaning "heel-grabber" or "supplanter," foreshadows his future actions in relation to Esau.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/birth_of_esau_and_jacob.htm">Birth of Esau and Jacob</a></b><br>This event marks the beginning of a significant biblical account involving themes of birthright, blessing, and God's sovereign choice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The birth of Esau and Jacob reminds us of God's sovereign plan and His ability to work through human history to fulfill His purposes.

God is deliberately drawing our attention to birth order.<p>- In the ancient world the firstborn son normally held special privilege and responsibility (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>- Yet, even before the twins are born, the Lord has announced that &#8220;the older shall serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The text invites us to watch how God&#8217;s sovereign plan overrides cultural expectations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came out red</b><p>- The newborn&#8217;s ruddy appearance is so striking that it is mentioned before anything else about him: &#8220;Came out red.&#8221;<p>- This color foreshadows his later nickname, &#8220;Edom,&#8221; meaning red (<a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>). When Esau trades his birthright for the red stew, the physical description and the future choice connect.<p>- Throughout Scripture, red often signals intensity&#8212;battlefields appear as blood-red water in <a href="/2_kings/3-22.htm">2 Kings 3:22</a>, and in <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a> the divine warrior&#8217;s robes are &#8220;red.&#8221; Esau&#8217;s redness hints at a life marked by earthy vigor and, at times, conflict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Covered with hair like a fur coat</b><p>- &#8220;Covered with hair like a fur coat&#8221; underlines how unusual this infant looked and felt.<p>- The detail prepares us for <a href="/bsb/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>, where Jacob uses goat skins to mimic Esau&#8217;s hairy arms (<a href="/genesis/27-11.htm">Genesis 27:11&#8211;23</a>). Isaac&#8217;s sense of touch confirms the literal truth recorded here.<p>- Hairiness also calls to mind wildness and strength. Later, Elisha is called &#8220;a hairy man&#8221; in <a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>, and John the Baptist wears &#8220;camel&#8217;s hair&#8221; in <a href="/mark/1-6.htm">Mark 1:6</a>, each signaling a rugged life on the edges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they named him Esau</b><p>- Names in Scripture interpret events. By saying &#8220;So they named him Esau,&#8221; Moses shows how the parents respond to what they see.<p>- The Lord often uses names to reveal destiny: Abram becomes Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>), Jacob becomes Israel (<a href="/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10</a>), and believers receive &#8220;a new name&#8221; in <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>.<p>- Esau&#8217;s name, tied to his appearance, foreshadows an identity rooted in the physical&#8212;contrasting with Jacob, whose new name will be rooted in his relationship with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a> reports exactly what happened in the birth room&#8212;order, color, texture, and the resulting name.
