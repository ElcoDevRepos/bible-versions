This longevity is consistent with the antediluvian (pre-Flood) patriarchs, who often lived for several centuries. The extended lifespans before the Flood are often attributed to the pristine conditions of the early earth, as well as God's blessing. After the Flood, lifespans gradually decreased, which some scholars suggest could be due to environmental changes or divine intervention. Noah's long life allowed him to witness significant events, including the repopulation of the earth and the establishment of God's covenant with humanity through the rainbow. His life serves as a bridge between the pre-Flood and post-Flood worlds, marking a transition in human history.<p><b>and then he died</b><br>The phrase "and then he died" is a common refrain in the genealogies of Genesis, emphasizing the mortality of even the most righteous individuals. Despite Noah's righteousness and his role in God's plan to preserve humanity, he was not exempt from the curse of death introduced in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the universal nature of death. Noah's death marks the end of an era, as he was the last of the pre-Flood patriarchs. His passing signifies the closing of a chapter in biblical history and the continuation of God's redemptive plan through his descendants, particularly through the line of Shem, leading ultimately to the coming of Jesus Christ. Noah's life and death foreshadow the need for a savior who would conquer death, a role fulfilled by Christ, who offers eternal life to those who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the Flood and repopulate the earth.

The whole life-time of Shem was 600 years; that of Peleg, a few generations afterwards, only 239. After him only one man, Terah, is described as living more than 200 years, and of his age there is great doubt. (See Note on <a href="/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a>.) Thus before Shem's death the age of man was rapidly shortening, and things were settling down to that condition in which they are set before us in profane literature.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/9-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Noah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1428;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5146.htm">Strong's 5146: </a> </span><span class="str2">Noah -- 'rest', patriarch who survived the flood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a total of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">950</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8672.htm">Strong's 8672: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nine, ninth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and then he died.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/9-29.htm">OT Law: Genesis 9:29 All the days of Noah were nine (Gen.
