This act of moving away signifies her emotional turmoil and helplessness. In the cultural context, a mother distancing herself from her child in distress is a profound expression of grief and despair. This moment reflects the human tendency to withdraw in times of overwhelming sorrow.<p><b>about a bowshot away</b><br>The term "bowshot" is a measure of distance, roughly equivalent to several hundred yards. This detail not only provides a vivid image of the scene but also emphasizes the separation between Hagar and Ishmael. The use of "bowshot" connects to the future of Ishmael, who is described as an archer in <a href="/genesis/21-20.htm">Genesis 21:20</a>, highlighting his destiny and survival skills.<p><b>for she said, &#8220;I cannot bear to watch the boy die!&#8221;</b><br>Hagar's words reveal her deep maternal love and anguish. The fear of witnessing her son's death is unbearable, showcasing the depth of her despair. This moment parallels other biblical instances where individuals face seemingly insurmountable trials, such as Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>. It underscores the theme of human vulnerability and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept.</b><br>Hagar's weeping is a poignant expression of her sorrow and helplessness. In biblical narratives, crying out often precedes divine intervention, as seen in the stories of the Israelites in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>. Her tears and cries are a form of prayer, even if unspoken, demonstrating the power of lament in seeking God's mercy.

Day after day the mother, with her child, had wandered in the wilderness, using the water in the skin sparingly, ever hoping to come to some spring, but with too little knowledge of the locality to guide her steps wisely. At last the water is spent, and the young life withers first, and the mother knows that soon they both must die. They had made their last effort, and with that hopelessness which travellers have so often described as stealing over the lost wanderer in the desert, they yield themselves to their doom. The boy is entirely passive; but not so the mother. A softer nature would have remained with him to soothe him, but the agony of the wild Egyptian will grant her no rest. She casts his fainting body almost angrily under a shrub, and withdraws to a bowshot distance, because she cannot bear to see him die. She there gives way not to tears only, but to unrestrained outcries of grief. But it is not her loud lamentation, but the mute prayer of Ishmael that is heard, and an angel of God comes to her relief.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she went, and sat her down</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>, the pronoun being added to the verb, as an ethical dative, to indicate that the action was of special importance to her, meaning, "she, for herself, or for her part, sat down" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrews Synt. ,' &sect; 315, a.; and Glass, 'Phil Tract.,' 1. 3. tr. 2. c. 6; and cf. <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>) - over against him a good way off.

Literally, <span class="accented">as those who draw the bow, i.e.</span> as far off as archers are accustomed to place the target (Keil). The sense is correctly given by the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For she said, Let me not see</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> look upon with anguish (cf. <a href="/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the death of the child</span> - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept</span>. The verbs, being feminine, indicate that it is Hagar's grief which is here described, and that the rendering, "and the child lifted up his voice and wept" (LXX.), is incorrect; although the next verse may suggest that Ishmael, like his mother, was also dissolved in tears. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then she went off</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
