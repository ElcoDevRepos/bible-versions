The use of "evening" and "morning" suggests a literal 24-hour day, a view held by many conservative scholars. The sequence of evening followed by morning reflects the Jewish understanding of a day, which begins at sunset. This pattern is consistent throughout the creation narrative, emphasizing the orderly and structured nature of God's creative work. The repetition of this phrase underscores the rhythm and intentionality in the creation process.<p><b>the third day.</b><br>On the third day, God gathered the waters and caused dry land to appear, calling it Earth, and the gathered waters He called Seas. This day also saw the creation of vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit. The third day is significant as it introduces the concept of life and growth, setting the stage for the sustenance of future living creatures. Theologically, the third day can be seen as a type of resurrection, as life emerges from the previously barren earth, prefiguring Christ's resurrection on the third day. The third day also establishes the foundation for the agricultural cycles that would be crucial for human survival and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who is actively involved in the process of creation, bringing order and structure to the universe.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_day.htm">The Third Day</a></b><br>A specific period in the creation account where God continues His work of forming the earth, marking the completion of another phase in the creation week.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening_and_morning.htm">Evening and Morning</a></b><br>These terms indicate the passage of time and the completion of a full day in the creation account, emphasizing the structured and orderly nature of God's work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_orderly_creation.htm">God's Orderly Creation</a></b><br>The phrase "evening and morning" signifies God's intentional design and order in creation.

Has modern geological research any trace of this third day s vegetation? The late Hugh Miller identified the long-continued epoch of profuse vegetation, since then unparalleled in rapidity and luxuriance, which deposited the coal-measures of the carboniferous system, with the latter half of this Mosaic day. Dana, Dawson, and others, rejecting this conclusion of the eminent geologist on the ground that the underlying Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian systems yield abundant fossiliferous remains of aquatic life, infer that the third day's vegetation is to be sought for among the "unresolved schists" of the Azoic period. The metamorphic rocks, it is true, have not as yet yielded any absolutely certain traces of vegetable life; and. indeed, it is an open question, among geologists whether any of the earliest formed metamorphic rocks now remain (cf. Green's 'Geology,' p. 308); but still it is susceptible of almost perfect demonstration that plants preceded animals upon the earth. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Among the hypozoic strata of this early period limestone rocks and graphite have been discovered, both of these being of organic origin. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> In the process of cooling the earth must have been fitted for vegetable life a long time before animals could have existed. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> As the luxuriant vegetation of the coal period prepared the way for the subsequent introduction of animal life by ridding the atmosphere of carbonic acid, so by the presence of plants must the ocean have been fitted to be the abode of aquatic life.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evening,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6153.htm">Strong's 6153: </a> </span><span class="str2">Evening</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">morning&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1465;&#1430;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1242.htm">Strong's 1242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dawn, morning</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the third</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7992.htm">Strong's 7992: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third, feminine a, third, a third, a third-story cell)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/1-13.htm">Genesis 1:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/1-13.htm">OT Law: Genesis 1:13 There was evening and there was morning (Gen.
