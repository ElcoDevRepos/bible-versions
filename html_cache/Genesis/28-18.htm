The morning is often associated with new beginnings and divine encounters in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning. Jacob's early rising suggests his eagerness to respond to the divine revelation he received in his dream.<p><b>Jacob took the stone that he had placed under his head</b><br>The stone served as Jacob's pillow during his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven. In ancient Near Eastern culture, stones were often used as memorials or markers of significant events. This stone becomes a symbol of the place where God communicated with Jacob, marking it as sacred. The use of a stone also connects to other biblical instances where stones are used as memorials, such as in <a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20-24</a>, where stones are set up to commemorate the crossing of the Jordan River.<p><b>and he set it up as a pillar</b><br>Setting up a stone as a pillar was a common practice in ancient times to commemorate significant events or divine encounters. This act transforms the stone from a simple object into a monument of worship and remembrance. Pillars in the Bible often signify God's presence or covenant, as seen in <a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>, where Moses sets up twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel.<p><b>He poured oil on top of it</b><br>Anointing the stone with oil signifies consecration and dedication to God. Oil in the Bible often represents the Holy Spirit and is used for anointing kings, priests, and sacred objects, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, where Samuel anoints David. This act of pouring oil indicates Jacob's recognition of the place as holy and set apart for God, foreshadowing the future anointing of places and people in Israel's religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandson of Abraham. He is on a journey to Haran to find a wife from his mother's family.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>The location where Jacob has his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven. Originally called Luz, Jacob renames it Bethel, meaning "House of God," after his encounter with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>Used by Jacob as a pillow during his sleep, this stone becomes a significant symbol as he sets it up as a pillar to commemorate his divine encounter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pillar.htm">The Pillar</a></b><br>A physical marker set up by Jacob to signify the place where God revealed Himself to him.

The worship of sacred stones (Baetylia), afterwards prevalent among the Greeks, Romans, Hindoos, Arabs, and Germans, though by some (Kuenen, Oort; <span class="accented">vide</span> 'The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231) regarded as one of the primeval forms of worship among the Hebrews, was expressly interdicted by the law of Moses (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-22.htm">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>). It was probably a heathen imitation of the rite here recorded, though by some authorities (Keil, Knobel, Lange) the Baetylian worship is said to have been connected chiefly with meteoric stones which were supposed to have descended from some divinity; as, e. g., the stone in Delphi sacred to Apollo; that in Emesa, on the Orontes, consecrated to the sun; the angular rock at Pessinus in Phrygia worshipped as hallowed by Cybele; the black stone in the Kaaba at Mecca believed to have been brought from heaven by the angel Gabriel (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kalisch in /Gee). That the present narrative was a late invention, "called into existence by a desire" on the part of the priests and prophets of Yahweh (Jehovah) "<span class="accented">to</span> proclaim the high antiquity of the sanctuary at Bethel, and to make a sacred stone harmless" ('The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231), is pure assumption. The circumstance that the usage here mentioned is nowhere else in Scripture countenanced (except in <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>, with reference to this same pillar) forms a sufficient pledge of the high antiquity of the narrative (<span class="accented">vied</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' &sect;
