Thirty is often seen as an age of maturity and readiness for leadership. In the Hebrew tradition, priests began their service at age thirty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>). David became king at thirty (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>), and Jesus began His public ministry at the same age (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). This age marks a transition from preparation to active service.<p><b>when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><br>Joseph's entry into Pharaoh's service marks a pivotal moment in his life and in the narrative of Genesis. After years of suffering and preparation, including being sold into slavery and unjustly imprisoned, Joseph is elevated to a position of power. This transition fulfills the dreams he had as a young man (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) and sets the stage for the preservation of his family and the future nation of Israel. Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt, was considered a god-like figure, and Joseph's role as his second-in-command highlights God's providence and sovereignty in using Joseph to influence a major world power.<p><b>And Joseph left Pharaoh&#8217;s presence</b><br>Joseph's departure from Pharaoh's presence signifies the beginning of his active role in implementing the plan to save Egypt from the impending famine. It demonstrates his authority and the trust Pharaoh placed in him. This moment also reflects Joseph's obedience and readiness to fulfill the responsibilities given to him, aligning with the biblical theme of faithful stewardship.<p><b>and traveled throughout the land of Egypt</b><br>Joseph's travels throughout Egypt were crucial for the administration of the seven years of plenty and the subsequent famine. By overseeing the collection and storage of grain, Joseph ensured the survival of Egypt and surrounding nations. This action prefigures the role of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and salvation. Joseph's journey throughout the land also symbolizes the spread of God's influence and wisdom beyond the confines of his immediate environment, impacting a broader region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is a Hebrew who has risen from slavery and imprisonment to become a powerful leader in Egypt.
