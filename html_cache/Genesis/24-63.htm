In biblical times, evening was often a time for reflection and prayer. The setting sun could symbolize the end of a phase or the beginning of something new, which is significant in the context of Isaac awaiting the arrival of his bride.<p><b>Isaac went out to the field</b><br>Fields in the ancient Near East were not only places of labor but also of solitude and reflection. Isaac's choice to go to the field suggests a desire for privacy and communion with God. Fields are often associated with God's provision and blessing, as seen in the parables of Jesus and the agricultural metaphors throughout Scripture.<p><b>to meditate</b><br>Meditation in the biblical sense involves deep reflection and communion with God. This act of meditation indicates Isaac's spiritual discipline and reliance on God. It reflects a practice of seeking divine guidance and peace, akin to the psalmist's meditations on God's law and works (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>).<p><b>and looking up</b><br>The act of looking up can symbolize anticipation and readiness to receive what God is providing. It suggests a moment of realization or revelation, as seen in other biblical narratives where looking up precedes a significant event or encounter with God (e.g., Moses and the burning bush).<p><b>he saw the camels approaching</b><br>Camels were a sign of wealth and were used for long journeys, indicating the importance of the approaching caravan. The camels' approach signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding Isaac's marriage. This moment foreshadows the meeting of Isaac and Rebekah, a union that continues the Abrahamic covenant. The camels also connect to the broader narrative of God's provision and faithfulness, as seen in the journey of the Magi to see Jesus, where camels are traditionally depicted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a key patriarch in the lineage of Israel.
