Her observation is crucial as it sets the stage for the subsequent actions. In the cultural context of the time, the matriarch of the family held significant influence over household matters. Sarah's perception and reaction are pivotal in the unfolding of God's covenant promises through Isaac.<p><b>that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham</b><br>Ishmael, the son of Hagar, is identified here. Hagar, an Egyptian maidservant, was given to Abraham by Sarah to bear a child due to Sarah's initial barrenness. This act reflects the customs of the time, where a servant could bear children on behalf of a barren wife. Ishmael's Egyptian heritage is noted, highlighting the cultural and ethnic diversity within Abraham's household. This also sets up the later distinction between Isaac, the child of promise, and Ishmael.<p><b>was mocking</b><br>The Hebrew word used here can imply laughter or derision. This mocking is significant as it represents a threat to Isaac's position as the heir of God's covenant with Abraham. The tension between Ishmael and Isaac foreshadows the future conflicts between their descendants. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, leading to Ishmael and Hagar's eventual departure, which aligns with God's plan for Isaac to be the sole heir of the covenant.<p><b>her son</b><br>Isaac is referred to as "her son," emphasizing Sarah's protective and possessive nature over him. Isaac is the child of promise, born to Sarah in her old age as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. This phrase underscores the special status of Isaac in the Abrahamic covenant, distinguishing him from Ishmael and setting the stage for the lineage through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac.

Her decisive response safeguards Isaac&#8217;s role as the promised heir, illustrating how the Lord preserves His plan even amid household tension. The verse reminds believers to recognize and address attitudes that oppose God&#8217;s promises, trusting that He sees, He judges rightly, and He faithfully upholds His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Mocking.</span>--The verb used here is the same as that rendered <span class= "ital">to laugh </span>in <a href="/genesis/21-6.htm" title="And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.">Genesis 21:6</a>, but in an intensive conjugation. What exactly Ishmael was doing is not said, but we may dismiss all those interpretations which charge him with abominable wickedness; for had he been guilty of any such criminal conduct, the sending him away would not have been so "very grievous in Abraham's sight" (<a href="/genesis/21-11.htm" title="And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.">Genesis 21:11</a>). On the other hand, we may feel sure that Sarah was not without good reason for her conduct; for St. Paul bears witness that Ishmael persecuted Isaac (<a href="/galatians/4-29.htm" title="But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.">Galatians 4:29</a>). The LXX. and Vulg. translate <span class= "ital">playing, sporting, </span>and Gesenius thinks that he was "dancing gracefully; "but if this were all, Sarah's jealousy would have been most unjust. When, however, we consider that Ishmael had been for fourteen years the heir, and that he now fell back into an inferior position, we cannot be surprised if at this banquet in his rival's honour he gave way to spiteful feelings, and by word and gesture derided and ridiculed him. Hagar too had probably never regarded Sarah with much affection since her forced return, and now that her son was disinherited, her bitterness would grow more intense. These jealousies are the inevitable results of polygamy; and wherever it exists, the father's life is made wretched by the intrigues of the women for their children.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarah saw</span> - at the feast already mentioned (Knobel, Keil); probably also on different occasions since the birth of Isaac - <span class="cmt_word">the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">ludentem cum Isaaco filio sue</span> (Vulgate), playing like a child (Aben Ezra, Knobel, Tuch, Ilgen), playing and dancing gracefully (Gesenius); but the stronger sense of the word, implying mockery, scoffing, irritating and deriding laughter (Kimchi, Vatablus, Grotius, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy), besides being admissible (cf. <a href="/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14, 17</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>), seems involved in the Piel form of the participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> (Kurtz), and is demanded by <a href="/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>.
