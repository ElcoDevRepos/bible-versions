This moment foreshadows his future prominence, as the tribe of Judah becomes central in Israel's history, eventually leading to the Davidic line and the birth of Jesus Christ. Judah's role here is pivotal, as he suggests an alternative to murder, showing a mix of pragmatism and moral consideration.<p><b>What profit will we gain</b><br>The question of profit reflects the brothers' materialistic and self-serving mindset. In the ancient Near Eastern context, familial loyalty was paramount, yet here, financial gain is considered over fraternal bonds. This phrase highlights the moral decline within Jacob's family, setting the stage for their eventual redemption and reconciliation.<p><b>if we kill our brother</b><br>The intent to kill Joseph reveals the depth of the brothers' jealousy and hatred. This act would have been a grave sin, violating the sanctity of life as established in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. The phrase underscores the severity of their initial plan and the potential for fratricide, echoing the story of Cain and Abel.<p><b>and cover up his blood?</b><br>The idea of covering up blood alludes to the biblical principle that bloodshed cries out for justice, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>. This phrase suggests an awareness of guilt and the need to conceal wrongdoing, reflecting the brothers' internal conflict. It also foreshadows the eventual exposure of their sin, as hidden sins are often revealed in biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah plays a pivotal role in the account of Joseph.

While Reuben had already attempted a rescue (<a href="/genesis/37-21.htm">Genesis 37:21-22</a>), Judah&#8217;s voice here reshapes the brothers&#8217; plan. This moment foreshadows his tribe&#8217;s prominence (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>). It also reminds us that God often works through imperfect people, moving the story toward His sovereign purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his brothers</b><p>The conversation stays &#8220;in-house,&#8221; highlighting the secrecy of their plot. Family sin can be especially destructive because it combines intimacy with betrayal (<a href="/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12-14</a>). The brothers&#8217; whispered schemes contrast with how Scripture urges open correction done in love (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What profit will we gain</b><p>Judah&#8217;s first concern is gain, not justice. His question exposes the lure of material benefit over moral obedience. Scripture repeatedly warns about placing profit above righteousness:<p>&#8226; &#8220;What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>Judah&#8217;s words anticipate the thirty pieces of silver that motivated Judas Iscariot (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if we kill our brother</b><p>Murder is being contemplated against a covenant sibling. The sanctity of life was already declared after the flood: &#8220;Whoever sheds man&#8217;s blood, by man his blood shall be shed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). God later etched the prohibition in stone: &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). By voicing this clause, Judah acknowledges the moral weight, even if his motives are mixed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cover up his blood?</b><p>The phrase hints at hiding evidence&#8212;echoing Cain&#8217;s denial, &#8220;Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9-10</a>). Scripture insists that concealed sin is still seen by God:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Be sure your sin will find you out&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;When I kept silent, my bones wasted away&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-5</a>).<p>Attempting to bury guilt never removes it; only confession and repentance do (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Judah&#8217;s question unmasks a heart wrestling between greed and conscience. While he rightly recoils from outright murder, his solution (selling Joseph, <a href="/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27-28</a>) still falls short of love. The verse warns us how easily profit can overshadow righteousness, how secrecy enables sin, and how God&#8217;s purposes march on even through flawed choices. Christ, the ultimate descendant of Judah, would later shed His own blood openly&#8212;not covered up&#8212;so that all hidden sin could be forgiven for those who turn to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Judah</span> (apparently shrinking from the idea of murder) <span class="cmt_word">said unto his brethren, What profit</span> is it if (literally, <span class="accented">what of advantage that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</span> (i.e. and hide the fact of his murder). <span class="cmt_word">Come, and let us sell him</span> <span class="cmt_word">to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and our hand, let it not be upon him</span>, i.e. to slay him);
