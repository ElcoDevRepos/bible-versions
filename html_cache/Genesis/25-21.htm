This reflects a pattern seen in the lives of the patriarchs, where direct communication with God is a central theme. Isaac's prayer is reminiscent of Abraham's intercession for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>) and foreshadows the priestly role of intercession seen in figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). The act of praying on behalf of another underscores the relational aspect of faith and the belief in a personal God who listens and responds to His people.<p><b>because she was barren.</b><br>Barrenness was a significant issue in the ancient Near Eastern context, often seen as a source of shame and a sign of divine disfavor. In the biblical narrative, barrenness is a recurring theme among the matriarchs, including Sarah (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>) and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>). This sets the stage for God&#8217;s miraculous intervention, emphasizing His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises. The theme of barrenness and subsequent divine intervention serves to highlight God's power and the unfolding of His covenant promises through seemingly impossible circumstances.<p><b>And the LORD heard his prayer,</b><br>This phrase underscores the responsiveness of God to the prayers of His people, affirming His active involvement in human affairs. The idea that God hears prayer is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17 and 1</a> <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>. It also reflects the covenant relationship between God and the patriarchs, where God is portrayed as faithful and attentive to their needs and concerns. This assurance of being heard by God is foundational to the faith of the Israelites and later Christian theology.<p><b>and his wife Rebekah conceived.</b><br>The conception of Rebekah is a direct answer to Isaac's prayer and serves as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>). This event is pivotal in the continuation of the Abrahamic line, leading to the birth of Jacob and Esau, and ultimately the nation of Israel. It also prefigures the miraculous births in the Bible, such as the birth of Samuel to Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>) and the birth of Jesus to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31-35</a>), highlighting God's intervention in human history to accomplish His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of the Israelites.

Tobit 12:12; <a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>. The word is commonly regarded as noting precum <span class="accented">multiplicationem</span>, <span class="accented">et vehementiam et perseverantiam</span> (Poole): cf. <a href="/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a> - <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span> - <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>; not because vers. 21-23 are the composition of the Jehovist (Tuch, Bleek, Davidson, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), but because the desired son was to be the heir of promise (Hengstenberg). The less frequent occurrence of the Divine name in the Thol-doth of Isaac than in those of Terah has been explained by the fact that the historical matter of the later portion furnishes less occasion for its introduction than that of the earlier; and the predominance of the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> over that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in the second stage of the patriarchal history has been partly ascribed to the employment after Abraham's time of such like equivalent expressions as "God of Abraham" and "God of my father" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">for his wife,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">opposite to</span> his wife, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. beside his wife, placing himself opposite her, and conjoining his supplications with hers (Ainsworth, Bush);
