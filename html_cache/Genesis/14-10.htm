These natural asphalt deposits were common in the region, providing a valuable resource in ancient times for waterproofing and construction. The presence of tar pits indicates a geologically active area, which aligns with the biblical narrative of Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction by fire and brimstone. The tar pits symbolize the treacherous and unstable nature of the region, both physically and morally, as Sodom and Gomorrah were known for their wickedness.<p><b>and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled</b><br>The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were part of a coalition of five cities that rebelled against the rule of Chedorlaomer and his allies. Their flight signifies a defeat in battle, highlighting the vulnerability and eventual downfall of these cities. This event foreshadows the ultimate judgment and destruction that would later befall Sodom and Gomorrah due to their sinfulness, as recounted in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.<p><b>some men fell into the pits</b><br>The phrase indicates the chaos and desperation of the retreating forces. Falling into the tar pits would have been a deadly consequence, illustrating the perilous nature of the terrain. This imagery serves as a metaphor for the moral pitfalls that ensnared the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, leading to their eventual destruction. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of judgment and the consequences of sin.<p><b>but the survivors fled to the hill country</b><br>The survivors' escape to the hill country suggests a strategic retreat to a more defensible position. The hill country often represents a place of refuge and safety in biblical narratives. This movement can be seen as a temporary reprieve from judgment, contrasting with the ultimate fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. The hill country is also significant in biblical history as a place where God's people often found protection and guidance, such as David's refuge from Saul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_siddim.htm">Valley of Siddim</a></b><br>This is the location where the battle took place.
