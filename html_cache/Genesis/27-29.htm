It signifies a future where Jacob's descendants, the Israelites, would have influence and authority over other nations. Historically, this was partially fulfilled during the reigns of King David and Solomon when Israel was a significant power in the region. Theologically, it foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, a descendant of Jacob, who is recognized as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>May you be the master of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.</b><br>This part of the blessing directly addresses the familial dynamics between Jacob and Esau. It fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Culturally, this was significant as it subverted the traditional primogeniture where the eldest son would typically receive the greater inheritance and authority. This reversal is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's sovereignty and His ability to choose whom He wills, as seen in the selection of David over his older brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>).<p><b>May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed.</b><br>This phrase is reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, establishing a divine principle of blessing and cursing based on one's relationship with God's chosen people. It underscores the protective and covenantal relationship God has with Jacob and his descendants. This principle is evident throughout biblical history, where nations that opposed Israel often faced divine retribution, while those who supported them were blessed. It also points to the broader spiritual truth that those who align themselves with God's purposes and people will experience His favor, a theme reiterated in the New Testament with the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>- The patriarch who is giving the blessing to his son, believing him to be Esau.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>- The son who receives the blessing through deception, pretending to be his brother Esau.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>- The elder brother who was supposed to receive the blessing but is deceived by Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>- The mother of Jacob and Esau, who orchestrates the deception for Jacob to receive the blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>- The land where these events take place, significant as the Promised Land for the descendants of Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_blessing.htm">The Power of Blessing</a></b><br>The spoken blessing carries significant weight and authority, reflecting the belief in the power of words and God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite human deception, God's purposes prevail.

The reason for this may be that it was a blessing which God must grant, and not man; or he may have had misgivings that it was more than Esau was worthy to receive; or, finally, his whole conduct being wrong, he could see and value only the earthly and lower prerogatives of the birthright. Subsequently he bestows the Abrahamic blessing upon Jacob in general terms (<a href="/genesis/28-4.htm" title="And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you may inherit the land wherein you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.">Genesis 28:4</a>); but this, its highest privilege, is confirmed to Jacob by Jehovah Himself (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm" title="And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 28:14</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let people serve thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and will serve thee</span>, <span class="accented">peoples</span>; at once a prayer and a prophecy; fulfilled in the political subjection of the Moabites, Ammonites, Syrians, Philistines, and Edomites by David; the thought being repeated in the next clause), <span class="cmt_word">and nations bow down to thee</span> (in expression of their homage): <span class="cmt_word">be lord over thy brethren</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">be a lord</span> (from the idea of power; found only here and in ver. 37) <span class="accented">to thy brethren</span>.
