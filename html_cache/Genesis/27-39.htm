This moment follows the deception by Jacob, who received the blessing intended for Esau. Isaac's response is significant as it reflects the irreversible nature of the patriarchal blessing. In the cultural context, a father's blessing was seen as prophetic and binding, carrying the weight of divine will.<p><b>Behold, your dwelling place shall be away from the richness of the land:</b><br>Esau's future is marked by separation from the fertile lands promised to Jacob. This phrase indicates a life of hardship and struggle, contrasting with the abundance promised to Jacob. Historically, Esau's descendants, the Edomites, settled in the rugged terrain of Seir, south of the Dead Sea, which was less fertile compared to the land of Canaan. This geographical setting aligns with the prophecy of living away from richness.<p><b>away from the dew of heaven above:</b><br>Dew in the ancient Near East was crucial for agriculture, especially in arid regions. Being away from the dew signifies a lack of divine favor and blessing, as dew was often seen as a symbol of God's provision (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>). This further emphasizes the difficult existence Esau and his descendants would face.

The patriarch is about to declare God-directed realities that will shape Esau&#8217;s future and the nation of Edom that springs from him (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your dwelling place shall be away from the richness of the land</b><p>&#8226; Esau&#8217;s descendants will settle in the rugged hill country of Seir (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>), a stark contrast to the fertile valleys Jacob&#8217;s line will inherit (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture later describes Edom as a land of rocky heights and deep ravines rather than overflowing fields (Obadiah 3&#8211;4; <a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise is not a curse of perpetual starvation; rather, it foretells a harsh environment that will demand resilience. Edom will depend on trade, raids, and alliances more than on farming (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; This separation also underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty in allotting territories (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>) and His faithfulness in keeping distinct the chosen line through Jacob (<a href="/numbers/23-23.htm">Numbers 23:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>away from the dew of heaven above</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Dew&#8221; in Scripture pictures God&#8217;s gracious provision (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>). By saying Esau will live &#8220;away from&#8221; it, Isaac foresees a life less touched by steady divine favor in the land itself.<p>&#8226; Edom&#8217;s climate bears this out: sparse rainfall, blistering summers, limited natural water sources (<a href="/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God does not abandon Esau. He grants Edom territory and protection (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4&#8211;5</a>), showing mercy even within harder boundaries.<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the contrast points ahead to the spiritual blessings that will flow through Jacob&#8217;s line to the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10&#8211;13</a>), blessings Esau forfeited when he despised his birthright (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-39.htm">Genesis 27:39</a> is Isaac&#8217;s Spirit-guided forecast that Esau&#8217;s heirs will inhabit a rugged, less-fertile region, experiencing life &#8220;away&#8221; from the land&#8217;s richness and heaven&#8217;s dew. The verse explains Edom&#8217;s historical setting, highlights the consequences of Esau&#8217;s earlier choices, and magnifies God&#8217;s purposeful distinction between the lines of Jacob and Esau while still showing His ongoing providence over both.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">Isaac his father answered.</span>--Unwillingly, and only after repeated entreaty and earnest expostulation, and even tears, upon Esau's side, does Isaac bring himself to the effort to lessen in any way the painful consequences to his favourite son of his brother having robbed him of the blessing. Plainly, he felt that he had endeavoured to do what was wrong, and was afraid lest he should still be found resisting God's will.<p><span class= "bld">Thy dwelling shall be the fatness.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">thy dwelling shall be of the fat places of the earth. </span>(See Note on <a href="/genesis/27-28.htm" title="Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:">Genesis 27:28</a>.) But most modern expositors consider that the preposition should not be translated "of," but <span class= "ital">from, </span>that is:--<p>"Behold thy dwelling shall be away from the fat places of the earth,<p>And away from the dew of heaven from above,<p>And by (Heb., upon--depending upon) thy sword thou shalt live," &c.<p>By this rendering the parts of the blessing agree together. Those who have fertile lands live by agriculture, but the inhabitants of sterile regions must look to more adventurous enterprises for a living. So the Swiss, like the Greeks of old, long served as mercenaries in the armies of other states. Idumaea, though not destitute of fruitful tracts, and even famous for its orchards, was, as a whole, sterile and unproductive, and the people were restless and unquiet. Moreover, Isaac had already given the corn-land and vineyards to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-37.htm" title="And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?">Genesis 27:37</a>), and had no second gift of them in his power. It is no answer to this to say that as the same preposition is used in <a href="/genesis/27-28.htm" title="Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:">Genesis 27:28</a>, it cannot have a contrary sense in the two blessings. It there follows a verb of giving, and necessarily has a partitive signification. Here there is nothing absolutely to settle its meaning, and we are left to the general sense. Possibly, Isaac may have purposely used an ambiguous word; but the meaning as a whole is clear. Esau was to inhabit a land which by its barrenness would force him to a life of adventure, military service, and freebooting. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaac his father</span> (moved by the tearful earnestness of Esau) <span class="cmt_word">answered and said unto him</span>, - still speaking under inspiration, though it is doubtful whether what he spoke was a real, or only an apparent, blessing - (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">infra</span>) <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above</span>.
