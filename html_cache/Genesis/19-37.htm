The birth of a son signifies the importance of male offspring in ancient Near Eastern cultures for the continuation of family lines and inheritance rights. The context of this birth is significant, as it follows the morally complex and troubling events involving Lot and his daughters, reflecting the consequences of living in a corrupt society.<p><b>and named him Moab.</b><br>The name "Moab" is believed to mean "from the father," which is a direct reference to the circumstances of his conception. Naming in the Bible often carries significant meaning, reflecting character, destiny, or circumstances surrounding birth. The name Moab serves as a perpetual reminder of the origins of this people group, which would later have a complex relationship with Israel.<p><b>He is the father of the Moabites of today.</b><br>This phrase establishes Moab as the progenitor of the Moabite nation, a people who would become both relatives and adversaries of Israel. The Moabites settled in the region east of the Dead Sea, an area known for its fertile land. Throughout biblical history, the Moabites had a tumultuous relationship with Israel, sometimes engaging in conflict and at other times in alliances. Notably, Ruth, a Moabite woman, becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ, illustrating God's redemptive plan through all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_older_daughter.htm">The Older Daughter</a></b><br>The unnamed elder daughter of Lot, who, along with her sister, took drastic measures to preserve their family line after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The son born to Lot's older daughter, who became the progenitor of the Moabite people.
