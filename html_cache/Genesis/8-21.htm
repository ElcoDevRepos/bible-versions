In ancient Near Eastern culture, burnt offerings were a common practice to appease deities, symbolizing devotion and seeking favor. The "pleasing aroma" signifies God's acceptance of Noah's sacrifice, indicating a restored relationship between God and humanity. This concept of a pleasing aroma is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>, where sacrifices are described as a "pleasing aroma to the LORD."<p><b>He said in His heart</b><br>This expression indicates a divine internal decision, emphasizing God's personal and sovereign will. It reflects the intimate nature of God's thoughts and plans, similar to His internal deliberation in <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6-7</a> before the flood. It underscores the personal relationship God maintains with His creation.<p><b>Never again will I curse the ground because of man</b><br>This promise marks a significant shift from <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, where the ground was cursed due to Adam's sin.

This assurance is foundational for the stability of the natural world, as seen in the covenant with Noah in <a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9</a>.<p><b>even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the persistent sinful nature of humanity, echoing <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>. It underscores the doctrine of original sin, suggesting that human depravity is inherent from a young age. Despite this, God's grace prevails, pointing to the need for redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>.<p><b>And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done</b><br>This promise is part of the Noahic Covenant, ensuring the preservation of life on earth. It contrasts with the total destruction of the flood, highlighting God's commitment to sustaining creation.

The phrase underscores that the sacrifice was acceptable; God receives sincere, obedient worship and responds favorably (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The continuity of this idea&#8212;an aroma that delights God&#8212;points forward to Christ&#8217;s once-for-all sacrifice, &#8220;a fragrant offering&#8221;

Here God pledges continued fertility and order (echoed in <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This promise anticipates later assurances of creation&#8217;s stability, such as <a href="/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20-21</a> and <a href="/isaiah/54-9.htm">Isaiah 54:9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth</b><p>&#8226;

Judgment does not disappear, but worldwide destruction by flood will never recur. The passage marries the reality of human depravity with the greater reality of divine mercy, anticipating the ultimate pleasing aroma&#8212;Christ&#8217;s sacrifice&#8212;that secures grace for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">A sweet savour.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a smell of satisfaction. </span>The idea is not so much that the sacrifice gave God pleasure as that it caused Him to regard man with complacency.

There seems at first sight to be an inconsistency between the two passages, and the Jehovist is accused of here contradicting the Elohist. For in the former place man's inborn sinfulness is described as an aggravation of his offence, while here it is used as a reason for mercy. But it is a characteristic of the Bible that it states the two sides of every principle with abrupt simplicity, and most heresies have arisen from seizing upon one side only, and omitting the other from view. Man is one whose every imagination of the heart is only evil continually. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>.) In the antediluvian world, with death indefinitely postponed, these imaginations had been unrestrained, and had therefore led to habitual and inveterate sin; and so justice at last had smitten it. But when man strives against them, and sin is the result of infirmity. then mercy heals and grace strengthens the penitent. When man, therefore, began his renewed life by hallowing it with religion, God saw therein the pledge of a struggle on his part after holiness, and the proof that the world would never again become totally corrupt. In this changed state of things human weakness was a reason only for mercy, and God gave the promise that so long as the world shall last, so total a destruction of man and his works upon it shall never again take place by the same agency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">smelled</span> - as is done by drawing the air in and out through the nostrils; from the root <span class="accented">ruach, to</span> breathe; high., to smell - <span class="cmt_word">a sweet savor</span>. <span class="accented">Reach hannichoach</span> literally, an odor of satisfaction, acquiescence, or rest; from <span class="accented">nuach</span>, to rest, with an allusion to Noah's name (vide <a href="/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); (cf. <a href="/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>). The meaning is that the sacrifice of the patriarch was as acceptable to God as refreshing odors are to the senses of a man; and that which rendered it acceptable was <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the feeling from which it sprang, whether gratitude or obedience; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the truths which it expressed - it was tantamount to an acknowledgment of personal guilt, a devout recognition of the Divine mercy, an explicit declaration that he had been saved or could only be saved through the offering up of the life of another, and a cheerful consecration of his redeemed life to God; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the great sacrifice of which it was a type. Paul, by using the language of the LXX. (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), shows that he regarded the two as connected. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said in his heart</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> resolved within himself. It is not certain that this determination on the part of Jehovah was at this time communicated to the patriarch (cf. <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3, 7</a> for Divine inward resolves which were not at the moment made known), unless the correct reading be <span class="accented">to his</span> (<span class="accented">Noah's</span>) <span class="accented">heart</span>, meaning the Lord <span class="accented">comforted</span> him (cf. <a href="/judges/19-3.htm">Judges 19:3</a>; <a href="/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>), which is barely probable. <span class="cmt_word">I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">I will not add to curse</span>. Not a revocation of the curse of <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, nor a pledge that such curse would not be duplicated. The language refers solely to the visitation of the Deluge, and promises not that God may not some. times visit particular localities with a flood, but that another such world-wide catastrophe should never overtake the human race. <span class="cmt_word">For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</span> <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> assigns this as the reason for man's destruction; a proof of inconsistency between the Elohistic author and his Jehovistic editor (Bleek). "Hie inconstantiae videtur Deus accusari posse" (Luther). "God seems to contradict himself by having previously declared that the world must be destroyed because its iniquity was desperate" (Calvin). Some endeavor to remove the incongruity by translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as <span class="accented">although</span> (Bush, Inglis), but "there are few (if any) places were <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can be rendered <span class="accented">although"</span> (T. Lewis). Others connect it with "<span class="accented">for</span> man's sake," as explanatory not of the promise, but of the past judgment (Murphy), or as stating that any future cursing of the ground would not be for man's sake (Jacobus). The true solution of the difficulty appears to lie in the clause "from his youth," as if God meant to say that whereas formerly he had visited man with judicial extermination on account of his absolute moral corruption, he would now have regard to the circumstance that man inherited his depravity through his birth, and, instead of smiting man with punitive destruction, would visit him with compassionate forbearance (Keil, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Tayler Lewis regards the expression as strongly anthropopathic, like <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>, and indicative of the Divine regret at so calamitous an act as the Deluge, although that act was absolutely just and necessary. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I again smite any more every living thing, as I have done.</span> There should be no more deluge, but - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/8-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">smelled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
