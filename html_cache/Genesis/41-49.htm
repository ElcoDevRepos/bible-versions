This phrase highlights Joseph's wisdom and foresight, as he diligently gathered and stored grain during the years of abundance. This act of preparation is a testament to his faithfulness and obedience to God's revelation through Pharaoh's dreams. The abundance of grain symbolizes God's provision and blessing, reminiscent of the promise to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p><b>like the sand of the sea</b><br>This simile emphasizes the vast quantity of grain stored by Joseph, drawing a parallel to the promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). The imagery of sand suggests an immeasurable and overwhelming abundance, indicating the success of Joseph's efforts and the fulfillment of God's plan. It also reflects the prosperity of Egypt during this period, which would later serve as a means of survival for many, including Joseph's own family.<p><b>that he stopped keeping track of it</b><br>The grain was so plentiful that it became impossible to measure or record accurately. This detail underscores the extraordinary nature of the abundance and Joseph's effective management. It also suggests a level of divine intervention, as the blessings were beyond human capacity to quantify. This mirrors the idea of God's blessings being immeasurable and overflowing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>.<p><b>for it was beyond measure</b><br>The phrase "beyond measure" indicates the limitless nature of the stored grain, which can be seen as a metaphor for God's infinite provision and grace. This abundance ensured that Egypt would not only survive the impending famine but also become a source of sustenance for surrounding nations. The concept of something being beyond measure is echoed in the New Testament, where God's love and grace are described as surpassing human understanding (<a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>). Joseph's role as a savior during the famine foreshadows Christ's role as the ultimate Savior, providing spiritual sustenance that is boundless and eternal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who, through God's providence, rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

Joseph models faithful stewardship&#8212;he neither squandered the blessing nor presumed upon it.<p>- By emphasizing &#8220;stored up,&#8221; the verse underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: He both gives abundance (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>) and the wisdom to manage it (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).

Joseph had been thorough&#8212;yet the blessing overtook the ledger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it was beyond measure</b><p>- The phrase crowns the verse, affirming that God&#8217;s supply exceeded any human metric. Compare <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20-21</a>, where Paul speaks of God &#8220;able to do immeasurably more.&#8221;<p>- It anticipates the New Testament principle: &#8220;Give, and it will be given to you&#8230; poured into your lap&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>).<p>- <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> mirrors this promise: when God opens the windows of heaven, &#8220;there will not be room enough.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s silos stood as visible proof.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-49.htm">Genesis 41:49</a> pictures God providing through Joseph so lavishly that ordinary accounting fails.
