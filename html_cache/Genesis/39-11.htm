The use of "however" suggests a contrast to previous events, highlighting the unexpected nature of what is about to occur. Joseph's life is marked by divine providence, and this moment is pivotal in God's plan for him.<p><b>Joseph went into the house</b><br>Joseph, a Hebrew slave in Egypt, had been entrusted with significant responsibilities in Potiphar's household. His entry into the house signifies his diligence and commitment to his duties. This setting is crucial as it becomes the backdrop for a significant moral test. The house, a place of both opportunity and temptation, reflects the dual nature of Joseph's circumstances.<p><b>to attend to his work,</b><br>Joseph's work ethic is emphasized here, showcasing his integrity and dedication. Despite being a slave, he serves faithfully, which is a testament to his character. This diligence is a recurring theme in Joseph's life, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>, which speaks of skilled work leading to positions of honor.<p><b>and not a single household servant was inside.</b><br>The absence of other servants sets the stage for the ensuing temptation. This detail highlights the isolation Joseph faces, making him vulnerable to Potiphar's wife's advances. The lack of witnesses underscores the gravity of the situation, as Joseph's integrity is tested in private. This moment foreshadows the trials of Jesus, who also faced temptation alone in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man sold into slavery by his brothers, now serving in the house of Potiphar, an Egyptian officer.
