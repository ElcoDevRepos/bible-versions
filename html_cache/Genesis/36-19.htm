Esau is a significant figure in the Bible, known for selling his birthright to Jacob for a meal (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>) and later being deceived out of his father's blessing (Genesis 27). The mention of his sons highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>). Esau's lineage is important as it establishes the Edomites, a nation often in conflict with Israel.<p><b>(that is, Edom),</b><br>Edom is the nation that descended from Esau, whose name means "red," possibly referring to the red stew for which he sold his birthright or the red land of Edom. The Edomites settled in the region south of the Dead Sea, known for its rugged terrain and red sandstone. Throughout biblical history, Edom had a tumultuous relationship with Israel, often opposing them (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1</a>). The prophets frequently spoke against Edom for their hostility towards Israel (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a>).<p><b>and they were their chiefs.</b><br>The term "chiefs" or "dukes" indicates a tribal or clan leadership structure among Esau's descendants. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Rebekah that two nations would come from her womb (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The chiefs of Edom are listed in <a href="/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36</a>, showing a well-organized society. This structure is similar to other ancient Near Eastern cultures, where tribal leaders held significant power. The mention of chiefs underscores the development of Edom as a distinct and organized nation, separate from Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, twin brother of Jacob.

Scripture often pauses after long lists to affirm their accuracy&#8212;see <a href="/numbers/26-63.htm">Numbers 26:63-65</a>, where the census is summed up in similar fashion. The Holy Spirit wants readers to recognize that nothing is missing; the promise given to Abraham of numerous descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5-6</a>) is being tangibly fulfilled in Esau&#8217;s line as well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are the sons of Esau</b><p>The focus narrows to physical lineage: these men are literally Esau&#8217;s offspring.
