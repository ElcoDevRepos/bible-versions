The name "Irad" may suggest a sense of "fugitive" or "wild ass," reflecting the turbulent times and the wandering nature of Cain's descendants. This lineage is distinct from the godly line of Seth, which is introduced later. The mention of Enoch and his descendants highlights the rapid expansion of humanity and the development of early civilization.<p><b>and Irad was the father of Mehujael</b><br>The name Mehujael can be interpreted as "smitten by God" or "God gives life," indicating a recognition of divine influence or judgment. This reflects the ongoing tension between humanity's sinful nature and God's sovereignty. The genealogy here serves to trace the development of human society and the continuation of Cain's line, which is marked by both innovation and moral decline.<p><b>and Mehujael was the father of Methusael</b><br>Methusael's name, meaning "man of God" or "they died who are of God," suggests a continued awareness of the divine, even within Cain's line. This name may imply a struggle between acknowledging God and living in rebellion. The genealogy underscores the complexity of human relationships with God, as even those outside the chosen line bear names that reflect divine interaction.<p><b>and Methusael was the father of Lamech</b><br>Lamech is a significant figure in Cain's lineage, known for his violent nature and polygamy, as described later in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>. His name means "powerful" or "conqueror," and he represents the culmination of the moral decline in Cain's line. Lamech's actions and his boastful declaration to his wives foreshadow the increasing wickedness that leads to the flood narrative. This genealogy contrasts with the line of Seth, which leads to Noah and the preservation of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enoch.htm">Enoch</a></b><br>Not to be confused with the Enoch who walked with God, this Enoch is a descendant of Cain, representing the continuation of Cain's lineage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/irad.htm">Irad</a></b><br>The son of Enoch, whose name may imply "fleet" or "wild ass," suggesting a life of independence or rebellion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mehujael.htm">Mehujael</a></b><br>The son of Irad, whose name could mean "smitten by God," indicating a possible acknowledgment of divine judgment or presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/methushael.htm">Methushael</a></b><br>The son of Mehujael, with a name that might mean "man of God" or "they died who are of God," reflecting a complex relationship with the divine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lamech.htm">Lamech</a></b><br>The son of Methushael, known for his violent actions and the first instance of polygamy in the Bible, which is further elaborated in the subsequent verses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The lineage of Cain illustrates the perpetuation of sin and its consequences through generations.

He introduces polygamy and boasts of vengeance, demonstrating sin&#8217;s escalation through the line (cf. <a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By presenting Lamech last, Scripture sets up a vivid contrast with the righteous Enoch and Noah in Seth&#8217;s line (<a href="/genesis/5-22.htm">Genesis 5:22, 29</a>), highlighting two diverging paths humanity can follow (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The clear, literal chain from Adam to Lamech underscores that depravity is inherited yet individual choices deepen it&#8212;warning every generation (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a> is far more than a list of forgotten names. It tracks the literal lineage of Cain, illustrating God&#8217;s mercy in allowing life and culture to grow even under judgment. Each generation retains echoes of God&#8217;s reality while also revealing a progressive hardening toward violence and pride, culminating in Lamech. The verse reminds readers that family lines matter, choices echo through descendants, and God&#8217;s patient grace coexists with the accumulating consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Unto Enoch was born Irad.</span>--Cain was building a city, <span class= "ital">'Ir, </span>and it was this probably which suggested the name <span class= "ital">'Irad. </span>It has little in common with Jared, as it begins with a harsh guttural, usually omitted in English because unpronounceable, but which appears as <span class= "ital">g </span>in Gomorrah. Possibly 'Irad means <span class= "ital">citizen; </span>but these names have been so corrupted by transcribers that we cannot feel sure of them. Thus, here the LXX. calls 'Irad Ga&#8249;dad, and the Syriac 'Idor.

But it is usually a similarity of sound only with a diversity of meaning. Thus Mehujael, <span class= "ital">smitten of God, </span>answers to Mahalaleel, <span class= "ital">glory to God; </span>Methusael, <span class= "ital">God's hero, </span>to Methuselah, <span class= "ital">the armed warrior. </span>Even when the names are the same, their history is often most diverse. Thus in the Cainite line Enoch is <span class= "ital">initiation </span>into city life, in the Sethite into a life of holiness; and the Cainite polygamist Lemech, rejoicing in the weapons invented by his son, is the very opposite of the Sethite Lemech, who calls his son Noah, <span class= "ital">quiet, rest</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Years passed away, the family of Cain grew to manhood, and, in imitation of their parents, founded homes for themselves. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Enoch</span> (whose wife probably would also be his sister, few caring at this early stage to intermarry with the accursed race) <span class="cmt_word">was born Irad.</span> <span class="accented">Townsman</span>, citizen, <span class="accented">urbanus civilis</span> (Keil, Lange); fleet as a wild ass (Murphy); ornament of a city, from Ir, a city (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And Irad begat Mehujael.</span> Smitten of God (Keil, Gesenius, Murphy), the purified or formed of God (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">And Mehujael begat Methusael.</span> Man of God (Gesenius, Lange), man asked or man of El (Murphy), man of prayer (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">And Methusael begat Lamech</span>.
