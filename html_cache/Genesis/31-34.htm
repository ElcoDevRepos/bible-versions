These idols were often used for divination and were considered symbols of household authority and inheritance rights. Rachel's motivation might have been to secure her family's future or to prevent Laban from using them against Jacob. This act also highlights the ongoing struggle between monotheism and polytheism in the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>put them in the saddlebag of her camel</b><br>The use of camels indicates the wealth and status of Jacob's family, as camels were valuable assets in ancient Near Eastern societies. Saddlebags were practical for long journeys, suggesting that Rachel was preparing for a significant departure. This action also demonstrates Rachel's cunning and resourcefulness in hiding the idols, reflecting the tension and mistrust between her and Laban.<p><b>and was sitting on them</b><br>Rachel's decision to sit on the idols can be seen as a deliberate act to conceal them from Laban. In the cultural context, sitting on something could imply ownership or control. This act also introduces a layer of irony, as the idols, which were supposed to provide protection and blessing, are rendered powerless and hidden under Rachel's seat.<p><b>And Laban searched everything in the tent but found nothing</b><br>Laban's thorough search underscores his suspicion and determination to retrieve the idols, which he likely viewed as essential for his household's prosperity and spiritual well-being. The fact that he found nothing highlights the futility of relying on idols and contrasts with the protection and providence offered by the God of Jacob. This incident foreshadows the eventual triumph of Jacob's God over the false gods of the surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The wife of Jacob and daughter of Laban, who took her father's household idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Rachel's father, who was searching for his household idols.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Rachel's husband, who was unaware of her actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_idols.htm">Household Idols (Teraphim)</a></b><br>Small idols or figurines that were often used for divination or as household gods in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/camel's_saddlebag.htm">Camel's Saddlebag</a></b><br>The place where Rachel hid the idols, symbolizing concealment and deception.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry can subtly infiltrate our lives, often hidden in the "saddlebags" of our hearts.

Scripture records the act plainly and literally&#8212;Rachel stole the teraphim, small household gods that Laban valued.<p>&#8226; The idols&#8217; presence points to Laban&#8217;s lingering paganism, echoing <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>, where Abraham&#8217;s ancestors &#8220;worshiped other gods.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Rachel&#8217;s theft violates the moral law later codified in <a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, &#8220;You shall not steal,&#8221; and anticipates the warning of <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a> that rebellion is &#8220;like the sin of divination.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Motives suggested by the broader narrative include:<p>&#8211; Securing perceived inheritance rights (cf.
