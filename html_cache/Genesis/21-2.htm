Sarah was well past the age of childbearing, emphasizing the divine intervention required for her to conceive. This event underscores the theme of God's faithfulness and power to fulfill His promises, even when circumstances seem impossible. It also prefigures the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, as both births were divinely orchestrated.<p><b>and bore a son to Abraham</b><br>The birth of Isaac is significant as it establishes the lineage through which God's covenant with Abraham would continue. Isaac is the child of promise, through whom God would build a great nation. This event is a pivotal moment in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for the development of the Israelite people. The birth of a son to Abraham also fulfills the cultural importance of having an heir, which was crucial in ancient Near Eastern societies for the continuation of one's lineage and inheritance.<p><b>in his old age</b><br>Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, highlighting the miraculous nature of the event. This detail emphasizes God's ability to work beyond human limitations and expectations. It also serves as a testament to Abraham's faith, as he believed God's promise despite his and Sarah's advanced age. This aspect of the story is echoed in the New Testament, where Abraham's faith is commended in <a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19-21</a>.<p><b>at the very time God had promised</b><br>This phrase underscores the precision and reliability of God's timing. God's promise to Abraham regarding the birth of Isaac was specific, and its fulfillment at the appointed time demonstrates God's sovereignty and faithfulness. This theme of divine timing is prevalent throughout Scripture, reminding believers that God's plans unfold according to His perfect schedule. The fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham also foreshadows the fulfillment of messianic prophecies, culminating in the birth of Jesus Christ at the appointed time (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham, who was initially barren but conceived Isaac as God had promised.
