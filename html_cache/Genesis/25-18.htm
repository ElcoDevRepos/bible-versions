Havilah is often associated with a region rich in resources, possibly located in the Arabian Peninsula. Shur is near the northeastern border of Egypt, suggesting a vast territory. This area aligns with the traditional understanding of the Arabian tribes descending from Ishmael, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that Ishmael would become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>). The mention of these locations highlights the fulfillment of God's word and the historical spread of Ishmael's lineage.<p><b>which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur</b><br>This specifies the location further, indicating proximity to Egypt and Asshur, which is associated with Assyria. The reference to Egypt and Asshur suggests a significant trade route and cultural exchange area. This positioning also reflects the historical interactions between the descendants of Ishmael and neighboring nations, often marked by trade and conflict. The geographical markers underscore the strategic importance of Ishmael's descendants in the ancient Near East.<p><b>And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of the prophecy given to Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, where it was foretold that Ishmael would live in conflict with his relatives. This hostility can be seen throughout biblical history, as the descendants of Ishmael often clashed with the Israelites and other neighboring tribes. The ongoing tension serves as a reminder of the complex relationships between the descendants of Abraham and the broader narrative of God's covenant people. This hostility also foreshadows the broader theme of conflict and reconciliation found throughout Scripture, ultimately pointing to the peace brought by Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Hagar, whose descendants are mentioned in this verse.

This spans the vast desert corridor stretching east from Egypt across the northern Arabian Peninsula.<p>&#8226; Earlier in <a href="/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11-12</a>, Havilah was linked to the land of gold, emphasizing richness and distance; Shur is first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>, the wilderness where Hagar met the Angel of the LORD.<p>&#8226; By listing both markers, Scripture pictures Ishmael&#8217;s offspring filling the expanse between these points&#8212;exactly what was promised in <a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>, &#8220;I will make him exceedingly fruitful.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This fulfillment is historical, not figurative: the tribes named in <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-16</a> (Nebaioth through Kedemah) did inhabit the northern Arabian regions, verifying God&#8217;s word in real geography.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Which is near the border of Egypt&#8221; pinpoints the western edge of Ishmael&#8217;s range, echoing <a href="/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1-3</a> where Hagar, an Egyptian, entered Abraham&#8217;s story.<p>&#8226; &#8220;As you go toward Asshur&#8221; projects attention northeast toward Assyria. <a href="/genesis/2-14.htm">Genesis 2:14</a> notes the river flowing to Asshur, again linking earlier geography to later history.<p>&#8226; These phrases show Ishmael&#8217;s clans positioned along critical trade routes&#8212;caravans that later surface in <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25-28</a> (Ishmaelite traders buying Joseph). Their placement ensured lasting influence in commerce and culture, just as God foreknew.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They lived in hostility toward all their brothers</b><p>&#8226; The closing clause mirrors the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a> spoken over Ishmael: &#8220;He shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers&#8221; yet &#8220;his hand shall be against everyone.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hostility&#8221; proved true in recurring friction between Israel and desert neighbors: <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a> (Amalek), <a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a> (Edom), <a href="/bsb/judges/6.htm">Judges 6-8</a> (Midian), and <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a> (Amalek). Many of these peoples trace to Ishmael or intermarried with his line.<p>&#8226; Even while conflict persisted, God preserved Ishmael&#8217;s heritage&#8212;seen in <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6-7</a>, where Arabia&#8217;s camels bring gifts to Zion. Hostility never voided God&#8217;s care or His larger redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a> records the precise outworking of God&#8217;s word over Ishmael: a vast settlement from Egypt&#8217;s doorstep to Assyria&#8217;s frontier, embedded on key routes, and marked by perpetual tension with kin. Each phrase confirms earlier promises and prophecies, underscoring the trustworthiness of Scripture and God&#8217;s sovereign hand in the unfolding story of nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Havilah </span>was far to the south, on the Persian Gulf.
