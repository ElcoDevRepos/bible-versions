Abraham's offering of sheep and cattle signifies his wealth and his willingness to establish peace and goodwill. This act of giving is reminiscent of other biblical instances where offerings are made to establish or confirm agreements, such as Jacob's gift to Esau in <a href="/genesis/32.htm">Genesis 32</a>. The use of livestock in covenants also foreshadows the sacrificial system later established in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>and gave them to Abimelech</b><br>Abimelech was the king of Gerar, a Philistine city. This gesture of giving livestock to Abimelech indicates a formal and respectful approach to diplomacy. It reflects the cultural practices of the time, where gifts were often exchanged to solidify alliances or peace treaties. This act also demonstrates Abraham's integrity and desire to live peacefully with his neighbors, aligning with the biblical principle of living at peace with all men (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><b>and the two men made a covenant</b><br>Covenants in the biblical context were solemn agreements that involved commitments and promises between parties. This covenant between Abraham and Abimelech is significant as it represents a peaceful resolution to previous tensions over water rights (<a href="/genesis/21-25.htm">Genesis 21:25-26</a>). The making of a covenant often involved a ritual or symbolic act, such as the exchange of gifts or a shared meal, to seal the agreement. This covenant is a precursor to the more significant covenants God makes with His people, such as the Abrahamic Covenant in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> and the New Covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
