Pharaoh's anger reflects the volatile nature of royal favor and the precarious position of those serving in the royal court. In the broader biblical narrative, this incident is part of God's providential plan to elevate Joseph. The anger of a king is a recurring theme in Scripture, often leading to significant outcomes (e.g., <a href="/esther/1-12.htm">Esther 1:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/3-19.htm">Daniel 3:19</a>).<p><b>and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard</b><br>This phrase indicates the severe consequences of falling out of favor with Pharaoh. The "captain of the guard" is likely Potiphar, who previously purchased Joseph as a slave (<a href="/genesis/39.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>). This connection underscores the divine orchestration of events, as Joseph's imprisonment leads to his eventual rise to power. The mention of the "chief baker" alongside the cupbearer suggests a high-level conspiracy or offense, as both held significant positions in Pharaoh's court. This incident foreshadows Joseph's ability to interpret dreams, a gift from God that ultimately leads to his deliverance and rise to prominence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

(<a href="/genesis/41-10.htm">Genesis 41:10</a>) sets the scene by reminding us of a real moment in Egypt&#8217;s royal court: the cupbearer and baker had provoked the king&#8217;s wrath.<p>&#8226; This anger was not random; it came &#8220;after some time&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-1.htm">Genesis 40:1</a>) when &#8220;Pharaoh was angry with his two officials&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-2.htm">Genesis 40:2</a>). The cupbearer now recounts it to jog Pharaoh&#8217;s memory and introduce Joseph.<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows how a king&#8217;s temper can dramatically alter lives (<a href="/proverbs/16-14.htm">Proverbs 16:14</a>; <a href="/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-12.htm">Daniel 2:12</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s anger was a tool God used to move His plan forward.<p>&#8226; By highlighting Pharaoh&#8217;s past displeasure, the cupbearer humbly admits vulnerability, setting the stage for Joseph&#8217;s vindication and emphasizing that God works through rulers&#8217; emotions (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he put me and the chief baker</b><p>The cupbearer recalls, &#8220;and he put me and the chief baker&#8221; in confinement together.<p>&#8226; Both servants held trusted, intimate roles&#8212;handling Pharaoh&#8217;s food and drink (<a href="/genesis/40-1.htm">Genesis 40:1&#8211;2</a>).
