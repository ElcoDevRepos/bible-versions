This moment is significant as it marks the end of Jacob's life and the beginning of the future for his sons, who will become the leaders of the tribes. The calling of his sons signifies a formal gathering, a common practice in ancient times for delivering important messages or blessings. This act is reminiscent of other patriarchal blessings, such as Isaac blessing Jacob and Esau.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Gather around</b><br>The instruction to "gather around" indicates the importance of the message Jacob is about to deliver. It suggests a solemn assembly, where the sons are to be attentive and respectful. This gathering is not just a family meeting but a prophetic declaration that will shape the destiny of the tribes of Israel. The act of gathering also reflects the unity and collective identity of the family, which is crucial for the future nation of Israel.<p><b>so that I can tell you what will happen to you</b><br>Jacob is about to deliver a prophetic message concerning the future of his sons. This phrase indicates that the message is not merely a blessing but a revelation of future events. The prophetic nature of Jacob's words is significant, as it aligns with the biblical theme of God revealing His plans through chosen individuals. This prophecy will have both immediate and long-term implications for the tribes of Israel.<p><b>in the days to come:</b><br>The phrase "in the days to come" suggests a future-oriented prophecy, extending beyond the immediate context to the unfolding history of Israel. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Messianic age and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The phrase also connects to other prophetic scriptures that speak of the "last days" or future times, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the patriarch of the twelve tribes of Israel.

By many modern commentators, however, it has been placed in David's time, and even ascribed to Nathan, partly on the ground that it is too spirited to have been the composition of one lying in the last decrepitude of old age, but chiefly because, in the description given of Judah, it is supposed to refer to the elevation of David to the royal dignity. But if it was thus written by a member of David's court, we should reasonably expect an exact knowledge of the state of things in David's time. For this, in fact, is the argument upon which these critics depend, that the internal evidence shows that it belongs to David's reign. Now, so far is this from being true, that not only is the whole exceedingly general, containing scarcely more than faint and dim hopes and anticipations, but, except in the matter of Judah's pre-eminence, there is no knowledge whatsoever of the arrangements of David's time. Thus, for instance, there is no word about Levi's priestly functions, and his dispersion in Israel is described as a punishment, and put upon exactly the same level as that of Simeon It is said in answer that it was David who established the priesthood, and set the Levites apart for their duties. If so, this was the very reason why Nathan, a seer of his court, should have put into Jacob's mouth some allusion to so important an event, in order to justify so strong a proceeding as the depriving of a tribe of its lands and political importance, the seizure of towns in every other tribe for the abode of its members, and the bestowal upon them of priestly functions. If however David, by an act of despotic power, was able to effect so violent a subversion of all tribal rights, it is strange that no reference is ever made to it: and, moreover, both the Pentateuch and the Books of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm" title="And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.">Joshua 3:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-33.htm" title="And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.">Joshua 8:33</a>, &c), of Judges (<a href="/context/judges/17-9.htm" title="And Micah said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.">Judges 17:9-13</a>), and of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1Samuel 2:13</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/2-27.htm" title="And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?">1Samuel 2:27-28</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-15.htm" title="And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.">1Samuel 6:15</a>, &c.) must be of a date so modern as for all remembrance of David's act to have passed away, and for the national traditions to have created for themselves a setting modelled upon a state of things that never existed, and which was contradictory to the most glorious age of the nation's history. But national traditions precede the historical period of a people's annals, and from the time of David careful records of all events in Judah and Israel were kept, and the history of Judah and Israel was one of the chief subjects of instruction given to the youth of the nation in the prophetic schools. But let us take another instance. At the settlement of the tribes in Canaan, it was Asher and not Zebulun to which the sea-coast upon the north fell by lot; south of Asher was the half-tribe of Manasseh, and south of this was Dan. (Comp. <a href="/judges/5-17.htm" title="Gilead stayed beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and stayed in his breaches.">Judges 5:17</a>.) Zebulun was an inland tribe, and did not "dwell at the haven of the sea." It is unnecessary to continue this examination, but generally we may affirm that the sole argument for Jacob's blessing having been written in historic times is the position given to Judah. Everything besides negatives this view; and we may reasonably ascribe the high rank of Judah to the fact that after the setting aside of Reuben, Simeon and Levi, he became the firstborn. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> (having closed his interview with Joseph and his two sons) <span class="cmt_word">called</span> (by means of messengers) <span class="cmt_word">unto his sons</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the others who were then absent), <span class="cmt_word">and said, Gather yourselves together</span>, - the prophet's last utterance must be a public one - <span class="cmt_word">that I may tell you</span> - literally, and I <span class="accented">will tell you</span> - <span class="cmt_word">that which shall befall you</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, in the sense of happening or occurring to any one, is here equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/42-4.htm">Genesis 42:4, 38</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">in the last days</span> - literally, <span class="accented">in the end of the days</span>, not simply in future time (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch), or in the times intervening between the speaker and the end of the human race (Murphy), but in the last age, the closing period of time, the era of fulfillment (Kurtz, Hengstenberg), which era, however, must be judged from the standpoint of the speaker (Baumgarten).
