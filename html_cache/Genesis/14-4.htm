Historically, Elam was located in what is now southwestern Iran. The subjugation suggests a political and military dominance, likely involving tribute or forced labor. This reflects the common practice in the ancient Near East where powerful kings exerted control over smaller city-states. The number twelve often symbolizes governmental perfection or completeness in the Bible, suggesting a complete cycle of domination.<p><b>but in the thirteenth year they rebelled</b><br>The thirteenth year marks a turning point, symbolizing rebellion and a break from the established order. The number thirteen can be associated with rebellion or apostasy in biblical numerology. This rebellion sets the stage for the conflict described in the subsequent verses, where the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities rise against Chedorlaomer. This act of defiance is significant in the narrative, as it leads to the involvement of Abram (later Abraham), who rescues Lot, his nephew. This event foreshadows the future liberation themes found throughout Scripture, including the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chedorlaomer.htm">Chedorlaomer</a></b><br>King of Elam, a powerful ruler who led a coalition of kings.

Twelve years is long enough to feel permanent yet short enough to remember freedom.<p>- Scripture often marks significant seasons&#8212;Israel spent twelve spies in Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-25</a>) and Jesus at age twelve dialogued in the temple (<a href="/luke/2-42.htm">Luke 2:42-49</a>). Each signals preparation before a decisive moment.<p>- God sometimes permits long stretches of difficulty to shape character, as seen with Joseph&#8217;s years in Egypt before exaltation (<a href="/bsb/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37&#8211;41</a>) and Israel&#8217;s forty-year wilderness trek (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p>- Takeaway: prolonged subjection can be part of God&#8217;s bigger narrative, not evidence of His absence (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They had been subject to Chedorlaomer</b><p>- To be &#8220;subject&#8221; means tribute and political control. The kings of the Jordan valley bowed to a foreign power headquartered far away&#8212;reminding us that domination is not always just about geography but authority (<a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>).<p>- Chedorlaomer ruled Elam, a strong eastern kingdom. His sway over five local kings (<a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1-3</a>) echoes later empires oppressing Israel&#8212;Egypt (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>), Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s Word repeatedly shows earthly powers rising and falling under His sovereign hand (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). Even ungodly rulers cannot act outside His ultimate plan (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But in the thirteenth year</b><p>- The hinge comes &#8220;in the thirteenth year.&#8221; Thirteen, following twelve, signals a break with the past&#8212;much like the thirteenth year of Jubilee breaks debts after seven sevens (<a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8-10</a>, pattern of release).<p>- Timing belongs to God. He appointed &#8220;the fullness of time&#8221; for Christ&#8217;s first coming (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>) and will appoint another day for His return (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>). Rebellion here is no accident; it unfolds on God&#8217;s clock (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They rebelled</b><p>- The five kings threw off oppression, but rebellion brings risk. Scripture warns that human revolt apart from God&#8217;s guidance ends badly (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>; <a href="/romans/13-2.htm">Romans 13:2</a>).<p>- Yet God sometimes uses rebellion as a catalyst for His salvation plan. In this chapter, the conflict draws Abram into battle, leading to the rescue of Lot (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14-16</a>) and the blessing from Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>), foreshadowing Christ the ultimate Priest-King (<a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-3</a>).<p>- Lessons:<p>&#8226; Oppression can provoke decisive moments where faith is tested.<p>&#8226; God can turn political turmoil into opportunities to display His covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance often requires stepping into the fight, trusting God for victory (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/14-4.htm">Genesis 14:4</a> records twelve years of imposed servitude, a sudden thirteenth-year turning point, and an act of rebellion that sets a larger redemptive story in motion.
