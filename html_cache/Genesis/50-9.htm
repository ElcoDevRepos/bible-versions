In ancient Egypt, chariots and horsemen were symbols of power and prestige, often used in military contexts. The inclusion of such a formidable escort suggests the high regard in which Joseph was held in Egypt, as well as the importance of the event. This military presence underscores the respect Pharaoh had for Joseph, allowing him to honor his father with such a grand procession. The use of chariots and horsemen also reflects the Egyptian influence on Joseph's life, as he had risen to a position of great authority in Pharaoh's court.<p><b>and it was an exceedingly large procession</b><br>The size of the procession highlights the significance of Jacob's burial and the honor accorded to him. This large gathering would have included not only Joseph's family but also Egyptian officials and dignitaries, indicating the integration of Joseph's family into Egyptian society. The grand scale of the procession can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham's descendants a great nation, as even in death, Jacob is honored by a multitude. This event foreshadows the eventual Exodus, where a large group of Israelites will leave Egypt, led by Moses. The procession also serves as a type of Christ, as it prefigures the honor and reverence given to Jesus in His burial, despite His humble beginnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt and is leading the procession to bury his father, Jacob, in Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_and_horsemen.htm">Chariots and Horsemen</a></b><br>- These represent the Egyptian military escort accompanying Joseph, signifying the importance of the event and Joseph's status in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>- The patriarch whose death and burial are the focus of this passage.
