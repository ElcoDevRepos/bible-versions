The city referred to is likely ancient Egypt's capital, where Joseph held a high position. The quick pursuit suggests a premeditated plan by Joseph to test his brothers. The geographical context highlights the proximity to the city, emphasizing the brothers' vulnerability and the control Joseph had over the situation.<p><b>when Joseph told his steward</b><br>Joseph's steward plays a crucial role as an intermediary. In ancient Egyptian culture, stewards were trusted servants responsible for managing household affairs. Joseph's use of a steward reflects his authority and the structured hierarchy of his household. This delegation also mirrors the way God often uses intermediaries, such as prophets, to communicate His will.<p><b>&#8220;Pursue the men at once</b><br>The command to pursue indicates a sense of urgency and purpose. This pursuit is not merely a chase but a strategic move by Joseph to bring about a confrontation. Theologically, this can be seen as a parallel to how God pursues humanity, seeking reconciliation and truth. The pursuit also foreshadows the relentless nature of divine justice and mercy.<p><b>and when you overtake them</b><br>The overtaking signifies an inevitable encounter. It reflects the inescapable nature of divine justice and the certainty of God's plans. In a broader biblical context, this can be compared to the way God's purposes are ultimately fulfilled, regardless of human actions. The brothers' inability to escape mirrors the futility of trying to evade divine will.<p><b>ask, &#8216;Why have you repaid good with evil?</b><br>This question is central to the narrative, highlighting themes of justice, morality, and repentance. It echoes the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The accusation of repaying good with evil is a test of the brothers' integrity and a reflection of their past actions against Joseph. It also serves as a type of Christ, who was similarly betrayed despite doing good, pointing to the ultimate redemption and forgiveness found in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who is testing his brothers to see if they have changed since they sold him into slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_steward.htm">Joseph's Steward</a></b><br>The servant tasked with carrying out Joseph's orders, including the pursuit of his brothers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who are returning to Canaan after buying grain in Egypt, unaware of the test Joseph has set for them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to the Egyptian city where Joseph resides and governs, likely Memphis or another major city of the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit.htm">The Pursuit</a></b><br>The event where Joseph's steward is sent to confront the brothers about the alleged theft of Joseph's silver cup.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/testing_and_transformation.htm">Testing and Transformation</a></b><br>Joseph's actions are a test to see if his brothers have changed.

Similar strategic timing appears when Abraham&#8217;s servant &#8220;arose and went&#8221; the moment Rebekah agreed to leave (<a href="/genesis/24-61.htm">Genesis 24:61</a>) and when the two angels urged Lot to leave Sodom &#8220;at dawn&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God often works in the in-between moments, arranging circumstances so that nothing is accidental (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). Joseph&#8217;s careful timing underscores God&#8217;s hidden hand directing events toward reconciliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Joseph told his steward</b><p>&#8226; Joseph delegates the task, mirroring Pharaoh&#8217;s earlier trust in him (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>). Leadership and authority flow down in orderly fashion (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The steward has witnessed Joseph&#8217;s integrity and now obeys without hesitation, much like Eliezer carrying out Abraham&#8217;s instructions (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s steward functions as Joseph&#8217;s mouthpiece, just as Moses would later speak for God before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1&#8211;2</a>). The pattern highlights the truth that God often speaks and acts through appointed servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pursue the men at once</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;At once&#8221; indicates urgency. Joseph is orchestrating a test, not vengeance (<a href="/genesis/44-15.htm">Genesis 44:15&#8211;17</a>). Quick pursuit prevents the brothers from dispersing and underscores the seriousness of the matter, echoing Joshua&#8217;s immediate pursuit of Achan after the sin at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-22.htm">Joshua 7:22&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; The pursuit pictures the way God lovingly but firmly pursues His people when sin threatens the covenant (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By commanding pursuit, Joseph ensures that the brothers will face the truth together, revealing whether they have truly repented of past jealousy and betrayal (cf. <a href="/genesis/37-18.htm">Genesis 37:18&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When you overtake them</b><p>&#8226; The steward is not told to confront from a distance; he must physically catch up, ensuring the evidence is displayed before their eyes. In Scripture, confrontation typically happens face-to-face for maximum clarity (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Overtake&#8221; carries the idea of inevitable encounter. Just as Joseph&#8217;s steward cannot fail, God&#8217;s own purposes cannot be thwarted (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The brothers&#8217; sense of security is about to be interrupted&#8212;an echo of how God interrupts our complacency to expose hidden issues (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ask, &#8220;Why have you repaid good with evil?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The steward&#8217;s single question summarizes the charge: betrayal of grace. Joseph had shown them favor&#8212;returning their money (<a href="/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>; 43:23) and feeding them lavishly (<a href="/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>)&#8212;yet they appear to have stolen from him.<p>&#8226; The wording mirrors God&#8217;s lament over Israel&#8217;s ingratitude&#8212;&#8220;What have I done to you? How have I wearied you?&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-3.htm">Micah 6:3</a>). It also foreshadows Jesus&#8217; anguish over Judas&#8217; betrayal after receiving bread from His hand (<a href="/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph is setting a moral mirror before his brothers. Years earlier they sold him into slavery despite his kindness; now the question forces them to face that history. Genuine repentance requires acknowledging how evil repays good (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By framing it as a question, Joseph invites confession rather than delivering immediate judgment, reflecting God&#8217;s heart that goodness should lead to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-4.htm">Genesis 44:4</a> records Joseph&#8217;s calculated, compassionate test. He sends his steward to overtake his brothers quickly, confront them with a piercing question, and expose the contrast between grace received and evil returned. The verse reveals God&#8217;s sovereignty over timing, the proper use of delegated authority, the loving pursuit that exposes sin, and the ultimate aim of bringing sinners to genuine repentance and restored fellowship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1440;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1469;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">far</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;q&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7368.htm">Strong's 7368: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become far or distant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
