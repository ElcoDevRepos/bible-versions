Seth's birth is significant as it represents the continuation of the godly line through which the promise of redemption would come. This lineage is crucial as it eventually leads to Noah and, ultimately, to Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>. Seth's name means "appointed" or "granted," signifying God's provision of another seed in place of Abel.<p><b>Adam lived 800 years</b><br>The long lifespan of Adam, as well as other patriarchs in Genesis, reflects the early conditions of the world, which may have been more conducive to longer life spans. This longevity allowed for the rapid expansion of the human population and the transmission of knowledge and culture across generations. The extended lifespans also emphasize the effects of sin on humanity, as lifespans gradually decrease after the flood. Adam's long life allowed him to witness the growth of his descendants and the spread of humanity.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Adam and Eve had many children beyond Cain, Abel, and Seth. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests a rapidly growing population, which would have been necessary for the early development of human society. This also explains where Cain found a wife and how early cities were populated. The Bible does not provide names or details for these other children, focusing instead on the line through Seth, which is central to the biblical narrative of redemption. The existence of other children highlights the fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, who lived for 930 years.

Antediluvian longevity is repeated throughout <a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> (e.g., Methuselah&#8217;s 969 years, v. 27), underlining an environment and genetic vigor that differed from post-Flood conditions (cf. <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; 8:22).<p>&#8226; Long life allowed the firsthand transmission of God&#8217;s words across generations.
