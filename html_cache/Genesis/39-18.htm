In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, a woman's scream would have been a call for immediate attention and assistance, indicating a serious breach of social norms. The act of screaming would have been seen as a defense mechanism, suggesting that she was the victim. This aligns with the biblical theme of false accusations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>, where false witnesses rise against the innocent.<p><b>he left his cloak beside me</b><br>The cloak, or garment, is a recurring symbol in Joseph's life, representing his status and identity. Earlier, Joseph's multicolored coat was a symbol of his father's favor, and its removal by his brothers marked his descent into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23</a>). Here, the cloak becomes evidence used against him, symbolizing the loss of his integrity in the eyes of others, despite his innocence. This parallels the stripping of Jesus' garments before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-28.htm">Matthew 27:28</a>), where His dignity was publicly challenged.<p><b>and ran out of the house.&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's decision to flee is a demonstration of his commitment to righteousness and his refusal to sin against God, as he stated in <a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>. This act of fleeing from temptation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to flee from sexual immorality (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>). Joseph's flight can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced temptation but remained sinless (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). The house, as a setting, represents a place of both opportunity and danger, highlighting the need for vigilance and moral fortitude in all environments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, known for his integrity and faithfulness to God.

Here, a righteous act is twisted into supposed guilt, foreshadowing how Jesus&#8217; seamless robe was gambled over while lies were told about Him (<a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And ran out of the house</b><p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s sprint is a practical picture of <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, both urging believers to flee sexual immorality.<p>&#8226; Potiphar&#8217;s wife reframes this flight as evidence of wrongdoing, illustrating <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>&#8212;calling evil good and good evil.<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s experience parallels later believers who suffer for doing right (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>); accusations may stick for a season, but God vindicates His servants (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14, 41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18</a> records Potiphar&#8217;s wife crafting a convincing lie: &#8220;but when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.&#8221; Her claim distorts Joseph&#8217;s righteous flight from temptation into alleged assault. By examining each phrase we see (1) a deceptive cry disguising sin, (2) misused evidence that actually points to virtue, and (3) a hasty exit that fulfills God&#8217;s call to flee evil. The verse highlights how integrity can be maligned, yet it assures readers that God ultimately honors and rescues those who remain faithful under pressure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/39-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but when I screamed for help,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7311.htm">Strong's 7311: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be high actively, to rise, raise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;z&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5800.htm">Strong's 5800: </a> </span><span class="str2">To loosen, relinquish, permit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his cloak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7713;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_899.htm">Strong's 899: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covering, clothing, treachery, pillage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">beside me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1510;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7779;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_681.htm">Strong's 681: </a> </span><span class="str2">A joining together, proximity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and ran</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;n&#257;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5127.htm">Strong's 5127: </a> </span><span class="str2">To flit, vanish away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">out [of the house].&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#363;&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2351.htm">Strong's 2351: </a> </span><span class="str2">Separate by a, wall, outside, outdoors</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/39-18.htm">Genesis 39:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/39-18.htm">OT Law: Genesis 39:18 And it happened as I lifted up (Gen.
