These kings formed an alliance to resist the domination of the four eastern kings led by Chedorlaomer. This reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of forming coalitions for mutual defense and military strength. The alliance highlights the political dynamics of the time, where city-states often banded together against larger empires.<p><b>to the Valley of Siddim</b><br>The Valley of Siddim is identified as the battleground for the conflict between the coalition of the five kings and the four eastern kings. This valley is believed to be located near the southern end of the Dead Sea. The name "Siddim" may suggest a place of fields or plains, indicating a flat area suitable for battle. Archaeological evidence suggests that this region was once fertile and populated, supporting the biblical narrative of cities like Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>(that is, the Salt Sea)</b><br>The Salt Sea is another name for the Dead Sea, known for its high salinity and mineral content. The Dead Sea is one of the earth's saltiest bodies of water and lies at the lowest point on the earth's surface. The reference to the Salt Sea provides geographical context, indicating the location of the Valley of Siddim. The Dead Sea region is significant in biblical history, often associated with judgment and destruction, as seen in the later account of Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction. This area serves as a backdrop for the unfolding events in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, emphasizing the historical and geographical setting of the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_the_valley_of_siddim.htm">Kings of the Valley of Siddim</a></b><br>This refers to the coalition of kings who joined forces in the Valley of Siddim.

What began as a fertile plain ripe for conquest became a salt-filled wasteland&#8212;reminding every reader that earthly power and rich terrain are fleeting, but the Lord&#8217;s word stands forever (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">All these were joined together.</span>--Were united in a confederacy, and so formed a pentapolis, or group of five allied towns, like the Philistine league with its five lords (<a href="/context/1_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.">1Samuel 6:16-18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The vale of Siddim.</span>--Mr. Conder (<span class= "ital">Tent-work, </span>ii. 16) says that the name <span class= "ital">Sidd </span>is still given by the Arabs to the cliffs or banks of marl which run along the southern edge of the plain of Jericho; and with this agrees Aben-Ezra's explanation, who derives the word from the Hebrew <span class= "ital">sid, </span>chalk. Mr. Conder searched throughout the Ciccar for traces of the ruined cities, but in vain; and "the gradual rise of the level of the plain, caused by the constant washing down of the soft marl from the western hills, would effectually," he thinks, "cover over any such ruins." He found, however, copious springs of water upon the north-western side of the lake, and considers that the five cities were in their neighbourhood.<p><span class= "bld">Which is the salt sea.</span>--From these words commentators have rashly concluded that the vale of Sodom was swallowed up by the Dead Sea; but not only is no such convulsion of nature mentioned in Genesis 19, but Abram is described as seeing the Ciccar-land not submerged, but smoking like a furnace (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm" title="And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.">Genesis 19:28</a>). Probably "the vale of Siddim" was the name of the whole district in which these sidds, or bluffs, are situated, and which extend round all the northern shores of the lake. Mr. Conder, after tracing the lines of former beaches, which show that the Dead Sea has long been shrinking in extent, tells us (<span class= "ital">Tent-work, </span>ii. 43) that geologists hold that it had reached its present condition long before the days of Abram. It still, indeed, covered a much larger space, for the rains at that time were far more copious in Palestine than at present; but it no longer extended over the whole Arabah, as, by the evidence of these beaches, was once the case.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">The Horites.</span>--<span class= "ital">Cave-men, </span>the aboriginal inhabitants of Mount Seir, subsequently conquered by the Edomites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm" title="The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-22.htm" title="As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead even to this day:">Deuteronomy 2:22</a>).

The extreme depression of the Dead Sea, being 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean ("the most depressed sheet of water in the world:" Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>.), conjoined with its excessive saltness (containing 26.25 per cent of saline particles), renders it one of the most remarkable of inland lakes. Its shores are clothed with loom and desolation. Within a mile from northern embouchure the verdure of the rich Jordan valley dies away. Strewn along its desolate margin lie broken canes and willow branches, with trunks of palms, poplars, and other trees, half embedded in slimy mud, and all covered with incrustations of salt. At its south-western corner stands the mountain of rock salt, with its columnar fragments, which Josephus says, in his day was regarded as the pillar of Lot s wife. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The latter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1433;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[five]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came as allies</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2266.htm">Strong's 2266: </a> </span><span class="str2">To unite, be joined, to tie a magic knot or spell, to charm</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Valley</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1430;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;meq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6010.htm">Strong's 6010: </a> </span><span class="str2">A vale</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Siddim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;id&#183;d&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7708.htm">Strong's 7708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Siddim -- a valley near the Dead Sea</span><br /><br /><span class="word">(that is,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Salt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4417.htm">Strong's 4417: </a> </span><span class="str2">Powder, salt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sea).</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3220.htm">Strong's 3220: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sea, the Mediterranean Sea, large river, an artifical basin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/14-3.htm">OT Law: Genesis 14:3 All these joined together in the valley (Gen.
