Manasseh and Ephraim would later become two of the tribes of Israel, with Ephraim often taking a leading role. Their names are symbolic: Manasseh means "causing to forget," reflecting Joseph's journey from suffering to prosperity, while Ephraim means "fruitful," indicating Joseph's success in Egypt. These names also foreshadow the future blessings and roles of these tribes in Israel's history.<p><b>were born to Joseph</b><br>Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob, was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt. His story is one of redemption and divine providence. The birth of his sons in Egypt signifies the continuation of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, even in a foreign land. Joseph's leadership and wisdom were instrumental in preserving the family line during a time of famine.<p><b>in the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt serves as a place of both refuge and testing for the Israelites. It is here that Joseph's family finds sustenance during famine, but it is also the land where they will eventually become enslaved. Egypt represents both the world and its systems, contrasting with the Promised Land. The birth of Manasseh and Ephraim in Egypt highlights God's sovereignty and ability to fulfill His promises regardless of geographical location.<p><b>by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On</b><br>Asenath, Joseph's wife, was the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of On, an important religious center in ancient Egypt dedicated to the sun god Ra. This marriage signifies Joseph's integration into Egyptian society and his high status. Despite this, Joseph remains faithful to God, and his sons are raised with an awareness of their Hebrew heritage. The mention of On, also known as Heliopolis, provides historical context, as it was a major city in ancient Egypt known for its religious significance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob and Rachel, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

Their names will later dominate the whole Northern Kingdom&#8212;often called &#8220;Ephraim&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>)&#8212;showing how the Lord can elevate those born far from Canaan into central roles. The priority reminds us that God&#8217;s plans often reach beyond human expectation, just as Paul observes that &#8220;God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were born</b><p>The verb signals historical reality, not myth. Scripture presents an unbroken family line from Abraham to the nation of Israel (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-28.htm">1 Chronicles 1:28&#8211;34</a>). Each birth testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness to the earlier promise, &#8220;In you all the families of the earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). In salvation history, real births of real people ground the unfolding covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Joseph</b><p>Joseph&#8217;s name anchors Manasseh and Ephraim to the patriarchal line. Once sold as a slave, Joseph now stands as a ruler who preserves life during famine (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). The Lord turns evil to good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>), and Joseph&#8217;s sons embody that reversal. Their inclusion prefigures how believers from every background are grafted into God&#8217;s family through Christ (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Egypt</b><p>Egypt, though foreign and pagan, becomes the place where God multiplies His people (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>). Abram had once sojourned there in weakness (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10&#8211;20</a>); Joseph thrives there in God-given authority (<a href="/psalms/105-17.htm">Psalm 105:17&#8211;22</a>). Geography never limits the covenant; God&#8217;s presence accompanies His people wherever He places them (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a>). The births in Egypt anticipate Israel&#8217;s later exodus and remind us that God redeems lives shaped in unlikely settings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Asenath</b><p>God works through Asenath, an Egyptian wife given to Joseph by Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>). Her very name shows the Lord weaving Gentiles into Israel&#8217;s story long before Ruth or Rahab. The sons she bears will stand before Jacob and receive blessings equal to those of Reuben and Simeon (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>). In Christ, the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile is shattered (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), foreshadowed here by Asenath&#8217;s role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>daughter of Potiphera, priest of On</b><p>Potiphera&#8217;s priestly status in the city of On (Heliopolis) underlines Egypt&#8217;s religious power. Yet instead of compromising Joseph, this alliance magnifies God&#8217;s sovereignty over nations (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). It shows that the Lord can use even pagan structures to advance His redemptive plan (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). The mention of On also hints at the future clash between Yahweh and Egypt&#8217;s gods during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a> records more than genealogy; it displays God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness reaching into Egypt, elevating Joseph, incorporating Gentile blood through Asenath, and securing two tribes&#8212;Manasseh and Ephraim&#8212;who will carry forward His promises.
