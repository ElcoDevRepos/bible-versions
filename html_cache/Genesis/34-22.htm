The context is the aftermath of Dinah's defilement by Shechem, the son of Hamor. The sons of Jacob deceitfully propose circumcision as a condition for intermarriage and peaceful coexistence. This reflects the cultural and religious significance of circumcision as a covenant sign given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). The idea of becoming "one people" suggests a merging of communities, which was a significant step given the distinct identity and covenant relationship of Jacob's family with God.<p><b>if all our men are circumcised as they are.</b><br>Circumcision was a physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, setting them apart from other nations. The demand for all the men of Shechem to be circumcised was not just a physical requirement but a spiritual and cultural one, symbolizing a deeper integration into the community of God's people. This condition, however, was used deceitfully by Jacob's sons as a means to weaken the men of Shechem, leading to their subsequent attack. The act of circumcision here is manipulated for vengeance rather than its intended purpose of covenantal faithfulness. This event foreshadows the New Testament teaching that true circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>), and points to the ultimate fulfillment of the covenant in Jesus Christ, who brings together Jew and Gentile into one body (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>- A city in the land of Canaan, significant in biblical history as a place of both covenant and conflict.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>- The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince who seeks to make a covenant with Jacob's family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechemites.htm">Shechemites</a></b><br>- The inhabitants of Shechem, who are asked to undergo circumcision to align with Jacob's family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_sons.htm">Jacob's Sons</a></b><br>- Particularly Simeon and Levi, who deceitfully agree to the terms with ulterior motives.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>- The daughter of Jacob and Leah, whose defilement by Shechem sets the events of this chapter in motion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_covenants.htm">The Significance of Covenants</a></b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people.

Conditions reveal motives: the Hivites want economic and marital benefits, while Jacob&#8217;s sons are concealing an agenda of vengeance. Scripture repeatedly shows that when humans impose terms for their own gain, the outcome is unstable (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14-16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will the men agree</b><p>Agreement must involve more than words; it demands unified consent from those affected. <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a> asks, &#8220;Can two walk together without agreeing where to go?&#8221;. Hamor seeks buy-in from all the town&#8217;s males because partial compliance would doom the plan. In <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a> the Jerusalem church decided matters &#8220;with the whole church,&#8221; illustrating that genuine agreement requires collective endorsement, not merely a ruler&#8217;s decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to dwell with us</b><p>&#8220;Dwell&#8221; points to everyday life&#8212;commerce, neighborhoods, marriages. God expected Israel to treat sojourners kindly yet stay distinct in worship (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The Hivites, however, envision full social fusion, blurring moral lines. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> warns against settling into ungodly patterns; living side by side can bless or corrupt, depending on whose values dominate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and be one people</b><p>Becoming &#8220;one people&#8221; sounds like harmony, yet here it masks compromise. When God joins people, unity is anchored in truth, as seen when He promises, &#8220;I will make them one nation in the land&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>) and when Christ &#8220;has made the two one&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>). The Hivites&#8217; proposal lacks that divine foundation. Mixing Jacob&#8217;s covenant family with pagan neighbors threatens Israel&#8217;s calling and foreshadows later warnings against unequal yokes (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if all our men are circumcised</b><p>Circumcision, instituted in <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>, marked covenant identity. The Hivites reduce it to a civic ritual&#8212;an entry fee for trade and intermarriage. <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a> required circumcision before a foreigner could eat Passover, but always with faith in Israel&#8217;s God. Mere surgery cannot produce spiritual change (<a href="/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>). Here it becomes a manipulative tactic, stripping the sign of its meaning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they are</b><p>&#8220; As they are&#8221; signals imitation rather than transformation. <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a> says believers experience &#8220;the circumcision done by Christ, not by human hands&#8221;. The Hivites want the mark without the covenant heart. Jacob&#8217;s sons know this, yet exploit the request to disable their foes. Outward conformity never substitutes for inward obedience&#8212;a timeless warning echoed in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>, where people honor God with lips while hearts are far away.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-22.htm">Genesis 34:22</a> records a conditional pact that appears reasonable but is riddled with self-interest. The Hivites seek prosperity and intermarriage; Jacob&#8217;s sons plot revenge. Circumcision, designed by God to signify faith, is hollowed into a political device. Scripture shows that true unity rests on shared submission to God, not on external marks or negotiated terms. Whenever covenant signs lose their spiritual substance, relationships built on them soon collapse, as the bloody aftermath of Shechem tragically proves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But only</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on this condition</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1440;&#1494;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
