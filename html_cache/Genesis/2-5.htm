The "shrub of the field" suggests uncultivated plants, possibly those that would later require human cultivation. This points to a pre-cultivation state of the earth, emphasizing the order and intentionality in God's creation process. It reflects a world in its initial stages, awaiting further divine action and human involvement.<p><b>nor had any plant of the field sprouted</b><br>The absence of sprouted plants suggests a world not yet ready for agriculture. This highlights the dependency of plant life on certain conditions, such as rain and human cultivation, which are yet to be introduced. It underscores the idea that creation was a process, with each step building upon the previous one, and that God&#8217;s creation was purposeful and orderly.<p><b>for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine provision and control over natural processes. The absence of rain signifies that God had not yet initiated the hydrological cycle necessary for plant growth. It suggests a unique environment, possibly a mist or dew-based watering system, as described later in <a href="/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>. This emphasizes God's sovereignty over creation and His role as the provider.<p><b>and there was no man to cultivate the ground</b><br>The absence of man indicates that humanity had not yet been created to fulfill its role as caretaker of the earth. This highlights the intended partnership between God and humans in the stewardship of creation.

Here, Moses zooms in on a particular category&#8212;plants that would later need human care.<p>&#8226; The wording prepares us for the ordered sequence God follows: first the environment, then the steward who will manage it (see <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor had any plant of the field sprouted</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Plant of the field&#8221; likely points to grain-bearing crops later harvested for food (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; These plants did not &#8220;sprout&#8221; because the conditions necessary for cultivated agriculture were not yet in place&#8212;no farmer, no plowed ground, no rhythmic seasons of sowing and reaping (<a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail underscores that human labor would be part of God&#8217;s good design from the beginning, not merely a post-fall punishment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s withholding of rain shows His sovereign control over the water cycle (<a href="/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26-27</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Immediately after our verse, <a href="/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a> adds, &#8220;But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.&#8221; Pre-flood irrigation came from subterranean sources rather than atmospheric rainfall.<p>&#8226; The first explicit rainfall in Scripture is the global Flood (<a href="/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4, 12</a>), emphasizing that normal precipitation began later in redemptive history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there was no man to cultivate the ground</b><p>&#8226; Verse 5 sets the stage for verse 7: &#8220;Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground.&#8221; Humanity is God&#8217;s appointed gardener (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>), called to &#8220;work it and keep it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Dominion and stewardship are intertwined (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>).

The more correct rendering is, "There was no shrub of the field (no wild shrub) as yet on the earth, and no herb of the field had as yet sprung up." The purpose of the writer is to prepare for the planting of the paradise, though geology teaches us the literal truth of his words. When the earth was so hot that water existed only in the form of vapour, there could be no vegetation. Rain began on the second day; on the third the vapours were so largely condensed as for the waters to form seas; and on the same day vegetation began to clothe the cool, dry surface of the ground. To understand these opening words, we must bear in mind that the object of the narrative is not now the formation of the world, but man's relation to Jehovah, and thus the long stages of creation appear but as one day's work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every plant of the field before it was</span> (literally, not yet) <span class="cmt_word">in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew</span> (literally, had not yet sprouted). Following the LXX., the English Version suggests an intention on the writer's part to emphasize the fact that the vegetation of the globe - here comprehended under the general terms, <span class="accented">shiah</span>, shrub, and <span class="accented">eseb</span>, herb - was not a natural production, but, equally with the great earth and heavens, was the creation of Jehovah Elohim - a rendering which has the sanction of Taylor Lewis; whereas the writer's object clearly is to depict the appearance of the earth at the time when the man-ward development of the heavens and the earth began. Then not a single plant was in the ground, not a green blade was visible. The land, newly sprung from the waters, was one desolate region of bleak, bare lava-hills and extensive mud-fiats. Up to that point the absence of vegetation is accounted for by the circumstance that the presently existing atmospheric conditions of the globe had not then been established, <span class="cmt_word">for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth</span>, and the ordinary agricultural operations on which its production was afterwards to depend had not then been begun, <span class="cmt_word">and there was not a man to till the ground</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1500;
