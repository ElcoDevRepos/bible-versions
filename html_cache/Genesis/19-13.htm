The impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is a divine judgment due to the cities' extreme wickedness. The destruction serves as a warning against sin and a demonstration of God's justice. The phrase indicates the certainty and immediacy of the judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. The destruction of these cities is later referenced in <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a> as an example of the consequences of immorality and rebellion against God.<p><b>For the outcry to the LORD against its people is so great</b><br>The "outcry" suggests that the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were not only numerous but also grievous, reaching a level that demanded divine intervention. This echoes the earlier narrative in <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>, where God tells Abraham about the great outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah. The term "outcry" can be understood as the collective cry of those oppressed or harmed by the city's sins, highlighting the social injustice and moral corruption prevalent there. This concept of an outcry is also seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where God hears the cries of the Israelites in Egypt, indicating His awareness and concern for human suffering.<p><b>that He has sent us to destroy it.&#8221;</b><br>The angels are acting as agents of God's will, sent to execute His judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of divine messengers carrying out God's commands, as seen in other instances such as the angel of death in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is a precursor to the final judgment, illustrating the ultimate fate of unrepentant sinners. It also serves as a type of Christ's second coming, where He will return to judge the living and the dead, as described in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. The sending of the angels underscores God's sovereignty and His active role in the affairs of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to execute judgment on Sodom.
