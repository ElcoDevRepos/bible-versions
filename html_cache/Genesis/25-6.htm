It reflects the wisdom and foresight of a patriarch ensuring the fulfillment of God's promises through Isaac, the son of promise. This action aligns with the biblical principle of setting one's house in order, as seen in other patriarchal narratives.<p><b>Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines</b><br>Abraham's concubines, including Hagar and Keturah, bore him sons who were not heirs to the covenant promise given to Isaac. The gifts can be seen as a form of inheritance, though distinct from the covenantal blessing. This practice of giving gifts to other sons is consistent with ancient Near Eastern customs, where the primary inheritance would go to the heir, while other children received lesser portions.<p><b>and sent them away from his son Isaac</b><br>This action ensured that Isaac's position as the primary heir was uncontested, preserving the integrity of the covenant line. It reflects the cultural and legal practices of the time, where the primary heir was often separated from other potential claimants to avoid disputes. This separation also prefigures the later separation of Israel from other nations, maintaining the purity of the covenant people.<p><b>to the land of the east</b><br>The "land of the east" likely refers to regions such as Arabia or Mesopotamia. This geographical direction is significant in biblical narratives, often associated with movement away from the Promised Land. It symbolizes a departure from the covenantal blessings associated with the land of Canaan. The eastward movement can also be seen in the story of Cain and the Tower of Babel, representing a move away from God's presence and promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Like Moses who commissioned Joshua before his own passing (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-1.htm">Deuteronomy 31:1-8</a>), Abraham acted &#8220;while he was still alive,&#8221; ensuring clarity and peace for the next generation. Scripture consistently shows righteous leaders planning ahead&#8212;Jacob blessed his sons before he &#8220;drew his feet into the bed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>), and David organized the temple treasury before he died (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1-9</a>). By moving proactively, Abraham modeled responsible stewardship of God-given duties.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abraham gave gifts</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-5.htm">Genesis 25:5</a> adds, &#8220;Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac,&#8221; yet verse 6 notes he &#8220;gave gifts&#8221; to the others. The distinction underscores two truths:<p>&#8226; Inheritance and covenant promises rested solely on Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham still showed tangible love to the rest of his household, echoing the principle that &#8220;a good man leaves an inheritance to his children&#8217;s children&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p>These gifts likely met material needs and honored familial ties without diluting the covenant line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the sons of his concubines</b><p>The concubines were Hagar (mother of Ishmael, <a href="/genesis/16-15.htm">Genesis 16:15</a>) and Keturah (mother of six sons, <a href="/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1-4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32-33</a>). Though their status differed from Sarah&#8217;s, the narrative treats their children as genuine offspring. Abraham&#8217;s action:<p>&#8226; Affirmed their dignity.<p>&#8226; Prevented rivalry by clarifying roles, much as later kings apportioned lands to multiple sons to avoid conflict (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-3.htm">2 Chronicles 21:3</a>).<p>This balanced justice with God&#8217;s revealed plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sent them away</b><p>Sending them away was not heartless exile but prudent separation. Earlier, God told Abraham to heed Sarah and send Hagar and Ishmael away (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12-14</a>). That episode foreshadowed this broader dispersal:<p>&#8226; It protected Isaac&#8217;s unique calling.<p>&#8226; It spared the family future strife over inheritance, as seen later between Jacob and Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41-45</a>).<p>&#8226; It extended Abraham&#8217;s influence into new territories as these sons became founders of nations (<a href="/genesis/25-12.htm">Genesis 25:12-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from his son Isaac</b><p>Isaac was &#8220;the child of promise&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-28.htm">Galatians 4:28</a>), and God declared, &#8220;through Isaac your descendants will be reckoned&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>). Distancing the other sons:<p>&#8226; Guarded the covenant that would lead to Israel, David, and ultimately Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Illustrated the biblical motif of separation between promise and flesh (<a href="/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>).<p>Isaac&#8217;s central role remains unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the land of the east</b><p>The &#8220;east&#8221; often signifies regions beyond the Jordan&#8212;areas later inhabited by Ishmaelites, Midianites, and other tribes (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). By relocating there:<p>&#8226; Abraham provided room for growth, echoing God&#8217;s earlier spread-out strategy for humanity after the Flood (<a href="/genesis/10-32.htm">Genesis 10:32</a>).<p>&#8226; He positioned his sons along trade routes where their descendants, such as the Midianite merchants (<a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25-28</a>), would interact with Israel&#8217;s story.<p>The move thus served both practical and providential purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a> shows Abraham acting with foresight and faithfulness. While alive he settled his estate, honoring each son yet preserving Isaac&#8217;s exclusive covenant inheritance. By sending the concubines&#8217; sons eastward, he prevented conflict and expanded his lineage&#8217;s reach. The verse underscores God&#8217;s unbroken promise through Isaac while displaying Abraham&#8217;s justice, generosity, and obedience&#8212;qualities that call every believer to steward God&#8217;s blessings wisely.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The east country.</span>--By this is meant Arabia and Southern Mesopotamia, where, by their superior vigour and organisation, the descendants of Abraham were able to establish their supremacy over the natives.
