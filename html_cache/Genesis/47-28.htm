This move was orchestrated by God to preserve Jacob's family during a severe famine, as Joseph, Jacob's son, had risen to power in Egypt. The seventeen years Jacob spent in Egypt were marked by peace and prosperity, contrasting with the earlier years of his life filled with struggle and hardship. This period allowed Jacob to witness the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding the preservation and growth of his descendants. The number seventeen in biblical numerology often symbolizes overcoming the enemy and complete victory, reflecting Jacob's peaceful end after a life of trials.<p><b>and the length of his life was 147 years</b><br>Jacob's lifespan of 147 years is significant in the context of the patriarchal narratives. His life was shorter than that of his father Isaac, who lived 180 years, and his grandfather Abraham, who lived 175 years. This decline in lifespan among the patriarchs is often seen as a reflection of the increasing effects of sin in the world. Jacob's life, filled with personal and familial struggles, is a testament to God's faithfulness despite human frailty. His age at death also underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to make him a great nation, as he lived to see his family grow and prosper in Egypt. Jacob's life and death prefigure the eventual exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, pointing to God's redemptive plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob is the father of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Earlier, the patriarch had feared death before seeing Joseph again (<a href="/genesis/42-36.htm">Genesis 42:36</a>), yet the Lord extended his days.<p>- This living is more than breathing; it is purposeful. God had pledged, &#8220;I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely bring you back again&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/46-4.htm">Genesis 46:4</a>). Jacob&#8217;s survival verifies that promise.<p>- Similar patterns:<p>&#8226; Abraham &#8220;died at a good old age, an old man and full of years&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaac likewise &#8220;breathed his last and died&#8221; after long life (<a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a> cites Jacob&#8217;s faith in blessing Joseph&#8217;s sons, confirming that his extended life served covenant purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Egypt</b><p>- Egypt, once the backdrop of Abraham&#8217;s stumble (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10&#8211;20</a>), now hosts Jacob&#8217;s family as a place of refuge. What seemed foreign becomes God&#8217;s provision.<p>- Joseph had urged, &#8220;You shall dwell in the land of Goshen and be near me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>). Jacob obeyed, demonstrating trust in God&#8217;s guidance through his son.<p>- The placement in Egypt sets the stage for Exodus. <a href="/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11</a> notes Pharaoh granting &#8220;the best part of the land.&#8221; God positions His people so that, even in a pagan nation, they multiply under His protective hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seventeen years</b><p>- The same length of time Joseph lived under Jacob&#8217;s roof before being sold (<a href="/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>).

Now God adds seventeen, showing that hard years can finish sweetly.<p>- The number also closes Genesis&#8217;s patriarchal era.
