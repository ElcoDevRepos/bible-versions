It signifies a complete transition, as he leaves the land of Canaan to go to Egypt. This journey is not just physical but also spiritual, as it involves trust in God's promises. The phrase "with all that he had" indicates total commitment and reliance on God, reminiscent of Abraham's journey in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-5</a>. It also foreshadows the eventual Exodus, where the Israelites will leave Egypt with all their possessions.<p><b>and when he came to Beersheba</b><br>Beersheba is a significant location in the patriarchal narratives. It is where Abraham made a covenant with Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>) and where Isaac built an altar and called upon the name of the Lord (<a href="/genesis/26-23.htm">Genesis 26:23-25</a>). This city serves as a spiritual waypoint, a place of worship and covenant, and a reminder of God's faithfulness to the patriarchs. It is located in the southern part of Canaan, marking the boundary of the Promised Land.<p><b>he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac</b><br>Offering sacrifices was a way to worship and communicate with God, expressing gratitude, seeking guidance, or making atonement. By referring to "the God of his father Isaac," Jacob acknowledges the continuity of God's covenantal relationship with his family. This act of worship at Beersheba connects Jacob to the faith of his forefathers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the covenantal promises. It also prefigures the sacrificial system that will be established under the Mosaic Law and ultimately points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends these offerings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, originally named Jacob, who is traveling to Egypt in response to his son Joseph's invitation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beersheba.htm">Beersheba</a></b><br>A significant location in the southern part of Canaan, known for its historical and spiritual importance to the patriarchs, including Abraham and Isaac.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices.htm">Sacrifices</a></b><br>Acts of worship and devotion to God, often involving the offering of animals, which were a central part of the covenant relationship between God and His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_his_father_isaac.htm">God of his father Isaac</a></b><br>Refers to the God of the covenant, emphasizing the continuity of faith and promise from one generation to the next.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_obedience.htm">Faithful Obedience</a></b><br>Jacob's journey to Egypt demonstrates obedience to God's leading, even when it involves leaving the familiar.

Jacob therefore determines solemnly to consult God before finally taking so important a step, and no place could be more suitable than Beersheba, as both Abraham and Isaac had built altars there for Jehovah's worship (<a href="/genesis/21-33.htm" title="And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.">Genesis 21:33</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-25.htm" title="And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.">Genesis 26:25</a>), and, moreover, it lay upon the route from Hebron to Egypt. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel</span> (as the head of the theocratic family) <span class="cmt_word">took his journey</span> - <span class="accented">literally, broke up</span>, sc. his encampment (cf. <a href="/genesis/12-9.htm">Genesis 12:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">with all that he had, and came</span> - from Hebron (<a href="/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to Beersheba,</span> - where Abraham (<a href="/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>) and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>) had both sojourned for considerable periods, and erected altars to Jehovah - <span class="cmt_word">and offered sacrifices unto the God</span> (the Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">of his father Isaac</span>.
