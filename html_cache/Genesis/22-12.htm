It underscores God's intervention and the importance of obedience over sacrifice. The phrase reflects God's sovereignty and His ultimate control over life and death. It also highlights the test of faith, where God examines the heart rather than the outward act. This moment is pivotal, as it demonstrates God's provision and mercy, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who would not be spared.<p><b>said the angel</b><br>The angel of the Lord is often seen as a theophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This divine messenger speaks with authority, indicating the presence and voice of God Himself. The angel's intervention signifies divine approval of Abraham's faith and obedience. In biblical narratives, angels frequently serve as messengers of God's will, emphasizing the importance of the message delivered.<p><b>for now I know that you fear God</b><br>This statement reveals the purpose of the test: to confirm Abraham's reverence and trust in God. The fear of God in this context is not terror but a profound respect and submission to His will. It is a central theme in the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrates his ultimate allegiance to God, setting a standard for faithfulness.<p><b>since you have not withheld your only son from me</b><br>Isaac is referred to as Abraham's "only son," emphasizing the depth of the sacrifice. Although Abraham had another son, Ishmael, Isaac is the child of promise through whom God's covenant would be fulfilled. This phrase parallels <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God does not withhold His only Son, Jesus, from humanity. The willingness to sacrifice Isaac prefigures the sacrifice of Christ, highlighting themes of substitutionary atonement and divine love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who demonstrates his faith and obedience to God by being willing to sacrifice his son Isaac.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>Abraham's beloved son, through whom God's promises were to be fulfilled.
