Their brotherhood is emphasized here, not just in terms of familial ties but also in their shared actions and characteristics. In the context of Genesis, their unity is highlighted in the incident at Shechem (Genesis 34), where they acted together in response to the defilement of their sister Dinah. This phrase underscores their close relationship and shared temperament, which plays a significant role in their father's prophetic blessings and rebukes.<p><b>their swords are weapons of violence.</b><br>This phrase refers to the violent actions of Simeon and Levi, particularly in the massacre of the Shechemites. Their use of swords symbolizes their propensity for violence and lack of restraint. In biblical times, swords were common weapons, often associated with warfare and judgment. The mention of violence here serves as a critique of their past actions and foreshadows the consequences for their tribes. Historically, the tribe of Simeon was eventually absorbed into Judah, losing its distinct identity, while the Levites were scattered throughout Israel, serving as priests and temple workers, which can be seen as a transformation of their violent past into a role of spiritual service. This transformation can also be seen as a type of redemption, reflecting the broader biblical theme of turning from sin to service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>The second son of Jacob and Leah.
