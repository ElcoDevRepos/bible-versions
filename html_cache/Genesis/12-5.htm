Sarai, later Sarah, is his wife and half-sister (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>). Their journey together is significant as it marks the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abram to make him a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). Sarai's role is crucial, as she is to be the mother of Isaac, through whom the covenant will continue.<p><b>his nephew Lot</b><br>Lot is the son of Haran, Abram's brother, making him Abram's nephew. Lot's inclusion in the journey is significant as it sets the stage for future events, including the separation from Abram and the eventual destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). Lot's presence highlights themes of family loyalty and the consequences of choices.<p><b>and all the possessions and people they had acquired in Haran</b><br>Haran is a city in Mesopotamia where Abram's family had settled after leaving Ur of the Chaldeans (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>). The mention of possessions and people indicates Abram's wealth and status, as well as the cultural practice of acquiring servants and livestock. This wealth would later play a role in Abram's interactions with other peoples and kings.<p><b>and set out for the land of Canaan</b><br>Canaan is the land promised by God to Abram and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It is a region that corresponds to modern-day Israel and surrounding areas. The journey to Canaan is a step of faith and obedience to God's call, symbolizing a break from the past and a move towards the fulfillment of divine promises.<p><b>When they came to the land of Canaan</b><br>This arrival marks the beginning of Abram's sojourn in the land that would become central to the biblical narrative. Canaan is significant not only as the Promised Land but also as a place of testing and faith for Abram and his descendants. The land's strategic location and fertile ground made it a desirable and contested region throughout history. Abram's presence in Canaan foreshadows the eventual establishment of Israel and the coming of Jesus Christ, who would fulfill God's promises to Abram.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.

As we have no data about the migration of Terah, except that it was after the death of Haran, and that Haran left children, we cannot tell how long the family rested at their first halting place, but it was probably a period of several years; and as Abram was "very rich in silver and in gold," he had apparently engaged there in trade, and thus possibly knew the course which the caravans took.<p><span class= "bld">The souls that they had gotten.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">had made. </span>Onkelos and the Jewish interpreters explain this of proselytes, and persons whom they had converted to the faith in one God.

The ford by which he crossed the Euphrates was probably that at Jerabolus, the ancient Carchemish, as the route this way is both more direct and more fertile than either that which leads to the ferry of Bir or that by Thapsacus. The difficulty of passing so great a river with so much substance, and people, and cattle would give fresh importance to his title of "the Hebrew," <span class= "ital">the passer over, </span>already his by right of descent from Eber, so named from the passage of the Tigris. More correctly, these names are 'Eber and 'Ebrew, and have nothing in common with "Heber the Kenite" (<a href="/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Judges 4:11</a>). From Carchemish Abram's route would lie to the south-west, by Tadmor and Damascus; and Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antiq., </span>i. 7) has preserved the legend that "Abram came with an army from the country beyond Babylon, and conquered Damascus, and reigned there for a short time, after which he migrated into the land of Canaan." In Eliezer of Damascus we have a reminiscence of Abram's halt there (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>). But it could not have been long, for Mr. Malan (<span class= "ital">Philosophy or Truth, </span>pp. 98-143) has conclusively shown by the dates in Holy Scripture that only about a year elapsed between Abram's departure from Kharan and his settlement in Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abram took</span> (an important addition to the foregoing statement, intimating that Abram did not go forth as a lonely wanderer, but accompanied by) <span class="cmt_word">Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the substance</span> - <span class="accented">recush</span>, acquired wealth, from <span class="accented">racash</span>, to gain (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-11.htm">Genesis 14:11, 16, 21</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>), which consisted chiefly in cattle, Lot and Abram being nomads - <span class="cmt_word">that they had gathered</span> (not necessarily implying a protracted stay, as some allege), <span class="cmt_word">and the souls</span> - here slaves and their children (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">that they had gotten</span> - "not only as secular property for themselves, but as brethren to themselves, and as children of the one heavenly Father" (Wordsworth); that they had converted to the law (Onkelos); that they had proselyted (Raschi, Targam Jonathan, and Jerusalem Targum) - <span class="cmt_word">in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan</span>; - a prolepsis (cf. <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, q.v.) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the land of Canaan they came</span> - a distance of 300 miles from Haran, from which their course must have been across the Euphrates in one of its higher affluent, over the Syrian desert, southwards to Lebanon and Damascus (cf. <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), where, according to Josephus, the patriarch reigned for some considerable time, "being come with an army from the land of the Chaldaeans" ('Ant.,' 1:07), and a village survived to his day called "Abraham's habitation." According to the partitionists (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson) this verse belongs to the Elohist or fundamental document; but if so, then the Jehovist represents Abram (ver. 6) as journeying through the land without having previously mentioned what land (cf. Quarry, p. 420). <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Abram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_87.htm">Strong's 87: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abram -- 'exalted father', the original name of Abraham</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
