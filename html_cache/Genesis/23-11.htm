The term "lord" here is a title of respect, not necessarily indicating a feudal relationship. It highlights the courteous and formal nature of the interaction between Ephron the Hittite and Abraham.<p><b>Listen to me.</b><br>This phrase indicates a shift in the negotiation process. In ancient cultures, verbal agreements were binding, and the speaker is emphasizing the importance of his words. It suggests a moment of sincerity and earnestness in the conversation.<p><b>I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it.</b><br>Ephron offers both the field and the cave, which is significant because it implies a complete transfer of property. The cave of Machpelah, located in Hebron, becomes the first piece of the Promised Land owned by Abraham's descendants. This act of giving can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>).<p><b>I give it to you in the presence of my people.</b><br>The presence of witnesses was essential in ancient transactions to ensure the legitimacy and future recognition of the agreement. This public declaration underscores the transparency and communal aspect of property transactions at the time. It also serves as a legal safeguard for both parties involved.<p><b>Bury your dead.</b><br>This phrase is a direct acknowledgment of Abraham's need and the purpose of the transaction. It reflects the cultural importance of burial practices and honoring the deceased. The burial of Sarah in the cave of Machpelah establishes a family tomb, which later becomes the burial site for other patriarchs and matriarchs, linking it to the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abraham's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>- A patriarch of the Hebrew faith, known for his faithfulness and obedience to God.

Ephron would make a present of cave and field to the patriarch, - "and just so have I had a hundred houses, and fields, and horses given to me" ('Land and Book,' p. 578), - the design being either to obtain a valuable compensation in return, or to preclude any abatement in the price (Keil), though possibly the offer to sell the entire field when he might have secured a good price for the cave alone was an indication of Ephron's good intention (Lange). At least it seems questionable to conclude that Ephron's generous phrases, which have now become formal and hollow courtesies indeed, meant no more in that simpler age when the ceremonies of intercourse were newer, and more truly reflected its spirit (Dykes, 'Abraham, the Friend of God,' p. 287). <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of the ions of my people give I it thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">have I given</span>, the transaction being viewed as finished): <span class="cmt_word">bury thy dead.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/23-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;No,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my lord.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
