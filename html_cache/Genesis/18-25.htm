It underscores the belief that God, by His nature, would not commit an act that contradicts His own standards of justice. This appeal to God's character is a common theme in Scripture, where God's actions are always consistent with His nature (e.g., <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p><b>to kill the righteous with the wicked,</b><br>Abraham is interceding for Sodom, concerned that the righteous might suffer the same fate as the wicked. This reflects a broader biblical principle that God distinguishes between the righteous and the wicked (e.g., <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). The plea also foreshadows the ultimate separation of the righteous and the wicked at the final judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><b>so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike.</b><br>The concern here is about the fairness of divine judgment. In the ancient Near Eastern context, collective punishment was common, but Abraham appeals to a higher standard of justice. This anticipates later biblical teachings on individual responsibility (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>) and highlights God's fairness in judgment.<p><b>Far be it from You!</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the seriousness of the appeal and Abraham's confidence in God's justice. It reflects a deep relational understanding between Abraham and God, where Abraham feels bold enough to question and reason with God, similar to Moses' intercessions (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>).<p><b>Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question affirms God's role as the ultimate judge, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>, <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>). It implies that God's judgments are inherently just and righteous. The phrase also points to the eschatological role of Christ as the judge of all (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), highlighting the consistency of God's justice throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is interceding with God on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah.

The verse invites us to approach God with similar trust, knowing that the Judge of all the earth always does what is right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That be far from thee</span> - literally <span class="accented">to profane things</span> (<span class="accented">be</span> it) <span class="accented">to thee - </span> nefas sit tibi = = <span class="accented">absit a te!</span> an exclamation of abhorrence, too feebly rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">to do after this manner</span> (literally, <span class="accented">according to this word</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and that it should be - as the righteous, so the wicked</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span> The patriarch appeals not to Jehovah's covenant grace (Kurtz), but to his absolute judicial equity (Keil). It does not, however, follow that the Divine righteousness would have been compromised by consigning pious and wicked to the same temporal destruction. This must have been a spectacle not infrequently observed in Abraham's day as well as ours. Yet the mind of Abraham appears to have been perplexed, as men's minds often are still, by the magnitude of the proposed illustration of a common principle in Providence. Though prepared to admit the principle when its application is confined to solitary cases, or cases of no great amplitude, yet instinctively the human mind feels that there must be a limit to the commingling of the righteous and the wicked in calamity, though it should be only of a temporal description. That limit Abraham conceived, or perhaps feared that others might conceive, would be passed if good and bad in Sodom should be overwhelmed in a common ruin; and in this spirit the closing utterance of his first supplication may be regarded as giving expression to the hope that Jehovah would do nothing that would even seem to tarnish his Divine righteousness. Abraham of course regarded this as impossible, consequently he believed that Sodom might be spared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/18-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Far be it from You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1448;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;li&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
