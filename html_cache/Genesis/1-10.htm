In the ancient Near Eastern context, naming was an act of power and control. The term "earth" here refers to the solid ground, distinguishing it from the waters. This separation of land and water is foundational for the creation of life, as it provides a habitat for terrestrial creatures and plants. Theologically, this act of naming reflects God's sovereignty over creation, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, "The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and everything in it."<p><b>and the gathering of waters He called &#8220;seas.&#8221;</b><br>The "gathering of waters" being called "seas" highlights the organization and order God brings to creation. In the ancient world, seas were often seen as chaotic and dangerous, yet here they are tamed and named by God, indicating His control over chaos. This mirrors the narrative in <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a>, where God sets boundaries for the sea. The seas are also significant in biblical prophecy and eschatology, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where the absence of the sea symbolizes the removal of chaos and evil in the new creation.<p><b>And God saw that it was good.</b><br>This declaration of goodness underscores the perfection and harmony of God's creation. Each stage of creation is marked by this divine approval, emphasizing that everything God creates fulfills its intended purpose. The phrase "it was good" is repeated throughout <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, reinforcing the inherent value and order of creation. This goodness is later marred by sin, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, but is ultimately restored through Christ, who reconciles all things to Himself (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The goodness of creation also points to the character of God, who is the source of all that is good (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is actively involved in the formation and naming of the earth and seas.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The dry land that God called into existence, representing the physical world that would later be inhabited by living creatures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seas.htm">Seas</a></b><br>The gathering of waters, which God also named, signifying the boundaries and order He established in creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>God names the earth and seas, demonstrating His authority and intentionality in creation.

The literal emergence of continents and soil reminds us that the material world is God-given, not accidental (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; His naming sets the precedent for mankind to steward the land under His rule (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the gathering of waters He called &#8220;seas&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

In opposition to the firmament, which was named" the heights" (<span class="accented">shamayim</span>), the dry land was styled "the fiats," "Aretz" (cf. Sansc., <span class="accented">dhara</span>; Pehlev., <span class="accented">arta</span>; Latin, <span class="accented">terra</span>; Gothic, <span class="accented">airtha</span>; Scottish, <span class="accented">yird</span>; English, <span class="accented">earth</span>; rid. Gesenius). Originally applied to the dry ground as distinguished from the seas, as soon as it was understood that the solid earth was continuous beneath the water masses, by an easy extension of meaning it came to signify the whole surface of the globe. <span class="cmt_word">And the gathering together of the waters called he Seas.</span> <span class="accented">Yamim</span>, from <span class="accented">yom</span>, to boil or foam, is applied in Scripture to any large collection of water (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>). "The plural form <span class="accented">seas</span> shows that the <span class="accented">one</span> p<span class="accented">lace</span> consists of several basins" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And God saw that it was good</span>. The waters having been permanently withdrawn to the place founded for them by the upheaval of the great mountain ranges, and the elevation of the continental areas, the work thus accomplished is sealed by the Divine approval. The separation of the land and water was <span class="accented">good</span>, as a decided advance towards the completion of the <span class="accented">cosmos</span>, as the proper termination of the work commenced upon the previous day, as the production of two elements in themselves beautiful, and in separation useful as abodes of life, with which they were in due course to be replenished. "To our view," says Dawson, "that primeval dry land would scarcely have seemed good. It was a world of bare, rocky peaks and verdureless valleys - here active volcanoes, with their heaps of scoriae, and scarcely cooled lava currents - there vast mud-fiats, recently upheaved from the bottom of the waters - nowhere even a blade of grass or a clinging lichen. Yet it was good in the view of its Maker, who could see it in relation to the uses for which he had made it, and as a fit preparatory step to the new wonders he was soon to introduce. "Besides," <span class="accented">the</span> first dry land may have presented crags, and peaks, and ravines, and volcanic cones in a more marvelous and perfect manner than any succeeding continents, even as the dry and barren moon now, in this respect, far surpasses the earth" ('O.W.,' p. 181). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;
