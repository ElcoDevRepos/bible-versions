This approach is seen throughout Scripture, emphasizing community and kinship, as in <a href="/genesis/13-8.htm">Genesis 13:8</a> when Abram addresses Lot as "brothers" to avoid conflict.<p><b>Jacob asked the shepherds,</b><br>Jacob's interaction with the shepherds highlights his journey and the importance of pastoral life in the ancient Near East. Shepherding was a common occupation, and shepherds often gathered at wells, which were vital community resources. This setting foreshadows Jacob's future role as a shepherd for Laban, and later, the shepherd imagery used for leaders in Israel, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>.<p><b>&#8220;where are you from?&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's question indicates his search for family and connection, as he is on a journey to find his relatives. This inquiry is reminiscent of Abraham's servant seeking a wife for Isaac in <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>, emphasizing the theme of divine guidance in finding one's place and people.<p><b>&#8220;We are from Haran,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>Haran is significant as the place where Abraham's family settled after leaving Ur (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>). It serves as a backdrop for several key biblical events, including Jacob's stay with Laban. Haran's mention connects Jacob's journey to the broader narrative of God's covenant promises to Abraham's descendants, highlighting themes of faithfulness and divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Esau.
