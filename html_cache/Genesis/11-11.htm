Arphaxad is significant as he is an ancestor of Abraham, linking Shem to the lineage through which God would establish His covenant with Israel. The genealogies in Genesis serve to connect the post-flood world to the patriarchs, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan. Arphaxad's name is also found in ancient Near Eastern texts, suggesting a historical basis for these genealogies.<p><b>Shem lived 500 years</b><br>The long lifespans recorded in Genesis are often seen as indicative of a different pre-flood and immediate post-flood environment. Shem's 500 years after the birth of Arphaxad suggest a significant overlap with many generations, allowing for the transmission of knowledge and tradition. This longevity underscores the patriarchal authority and the preservation of divine revelation through oral tradition. Shem's lifespan also connects him to the antediluvian world, bridging the gap between Noah and the patriarchs.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Shem's lineage was not limited to Arphaxad, though the biblical narrative focuses on the line leading to Abraham. The mention of other children highlights the growth and expansion of humanity post-flood, fulfilling God's command to "be fruitful and multiply." It also suggests the spread of Shem's descendants across different regions, contributing to the development of various Semitic peoples. This expansion is part of the broader biblical theme of God's providence in populating the earth and preparing the way for His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shem.htm">Shem</a></b><br>The son of Noah, Shem is one of the three sons who survived the flood.
