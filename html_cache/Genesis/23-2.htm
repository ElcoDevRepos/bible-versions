It was named after Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim, a race of giants mentioned in the Bible. This location is significant as it becomes a central place in the patriarchal narratives. The death of Sarah here marks a pivotal moment in Abraham's life, emphasizing the transient nature of life and the importance of the promised land.<p><b>(that is, Hebron)</b><br>Hebron is a significant city in biblical history, located in the southern part of the land of Canaan. It becomes a key city for the Israelites and is later associated with King David, who begins his reign there. The mention of Hebron highlights the continuity of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land, as it becomes a central location for the unfolding of Israel's history.<p><b>in the land of Canaan</b><br>Canaan is the land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants. It represents the fulfillment of God's covenant and is a symbol of divine promise and blessing.

This public display of grief is consistent with ancient Near Eastern customs, where mourning was an important social and familial duty. It also highlights Abraham's humanity and vulnerability, showing that even a man of great faith experiences profound sorrow. This moment foreshadows the compassion and empathy of Jesus Christ, who also wept at the death of Lazarus, demonstrating the deep connection between divine promise and human experience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac, Sarah is a matriarch in the lineage of Israel.
