Their relationship is foundational for understanding the biblical concept of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. This union is later affirmed by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>, emphasizing the sanctity and permanence of marriage. The phrase highlights the intimate partnership and equality between Adam and Eve, as both were created in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p><b>were both naked,</b><br>The state of nakedness here symbolizes innocence and purity. In the context of the Garden of Eden, it reflects a time before sin entered the world, when there was no shame or guilt. This nakedness is not just physical but also spiritual, indicating complete transparency and openness between Adam, Eve, and God.

Shame is often associated with sin and guilt, which had not yet entered the world. This phrase underscores the original righteousness and holiness of humanity before the Fall. It contrasts sharply with <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, where after sinning, Adam and Eve's eyes are opened, and they realize their nakedness, leading to shame and the need to cover themselves.

Moreover, there is a play upon words in the two verses. Man is <span class= "ital">arom </span>= naked; the serpent is <span class= "ital">arum=</span>crafty.

Not partially (Pye Smith), but completely destitute of clothing. Diodorus Siculus and Plato both mention nakedness as a feature of the golden age and a characteristic of the first men (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">Scholia in love</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The man and his wife</span>. The first pair of human beings are henceforth recognized in their relationship to one another as husband and wife. <span class="cmt_word">And they were not ashamed</span>. Not because they were wholly uncultivated and their moral insight undeveloped (Knobel, Kalisch); but because their souls were arrayed in purity, and "their bodies were made holy through the spirit which animated them" (Keil). "They were naked, but yet they were not so. Their bodies were the clothing of their internal glory; and their internal glory was the clothing of their nakedness" (Delitzsch). It is not surprising that the primeval history of mankind should have left its impress upon the current of tradition. The Assyrian tablets that relate to man are so fragmentary and mutilated that they can scarcely be rendered intelligible. So far as they have been deciphered, the first appears on its obverse side "to give the speech of the Deity to the newly-created pair (man and woman), instructing them in their duties," in which can be detected a reference' to something which is eaten by the stomach, to the duty of daily invocation of the Deity, to the danger of leaving God's fear, in which alone they can be holy, and to the propriety of trusting only a friend; and on its reverse what resembles a discourse to the first woman on her duties, in which occur the words, "With the lord of thy beauty thou shalt be faithful: to do evil thou shalt not approach him" ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 78-80). The Persian legend describes Meschia and Meschiane, the first parents of our race, as living in purity and innocence, and in the enjoyment of happiness which Ormuzd promised to render perpetual if they persevered in virtue. But Ahriman, an evil demon (Dev), suddenly appeared in the form of a serpent, and gave them of the fruit of a wonderful tree. The literature of the Hin-does distinguishes four ages of the world, in the first of which Justice, in the form of a bull, kept herself firm on her four feet; when Virtue reigned, no good which the mortals possessed was mixed with baseness, and man, free from disease, saw all his wishes accomplished, and attained an age of 400 years. The Chinese also have their age of happy men, living in abundance of food, and surrounded by the peaceful beasts ('Kalisch on Genesis,' p. 87). In the Zendavesta, Yima, the first Iranic king, lives in a secluded spot, where he and his people enjoy uninterrupted happiness, in a region free from sin, folly, violence, poverty, deformity. The Teutonic Eddas have a glimpse of the same truth in their magnificent drinking halls, glittering with burnished gold, where the primeval race enjoyed a life of perpetual festivity. Traces of a similar belief are found among the Thibetans, Mongolians, Cingalese, and others (Rawlinson's 'Hist. Illustrations of Scripture,' p. 10). The Western traditions are familiar to scholars in the pages of Hesiod, who speaks of the golden age when men were like the gods, free from labors, troubles, cares, and all evils in general; when the earth yielded her fruits spontaneously, and when men were beloved by the gods, with whom they held uninterrupted communion (Hesiod, 'Opera et Dies,' 90). And of Ovid, who adds to this picture the element of moral goodness as a characteristic of the <span class="accented">aurea aetas</span> ('Metam.,' 1:89). Macrobius ('Somn. Scipionis,' 2:10) also depicts this period as one in which reigned <span class="accented">simplicitas mali nescia et adhuc astutiae inexperta</span> (Maedonald, 'Creation and the Fall,' p. 147). "<span class="accented">These</span> coincidences affect the originality of the Hebrew writings as little as the frequent resemblance of Mosaic and heathen laws. They teach us that all such narratives have a common source; that they are reminiscences of primeval traditions modified by the different nations in accordance with their individual culture" (Kalisch) <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;i&#353;&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">both</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">naked,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#363;m&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6174.htm">Strong's 6174: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nude, either partially, totally</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and they were not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ashamed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;b&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_954.htm">Strong's 954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pale, to be ashamed, to be disappointed, delayed</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">OT Law: Genesis 2:25 They were both naked the man (Gen.
