In the ancient Near Eastern context, longevity was often seen as a sign of God's approval and a reward for righteousness. Abraham lived to be 175 years old, which aligns with the biblical theme of patriarchs living long lives, as seen with figures like Noah and Methuselah. This longevity underscores the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, including the promise of numerous descendants and a lasting legacy.<p><b>he breathed his last and died</b><br>The phrase "breathed his last" is a common biblical expression for death, emphasizing the cessation of life as a natural conclusion. In the Hebrew tradition, death is seen as a return to God, the giver of life. Abraham's death marks the end of an era, as he was the first patriarch and the recipient of God's covenant promises. His death is peaceful, indicating a life well-lived in accordance with God's will.<p><b>old and contented</b><br>This description highlights Abraham's satisfaction with his life, suggesting that he had achieved what God intended for him. The term "contented" implies a sense of fulfillment and peace, reflecting the biblical ideal of dying in a state of spiritual and emotional completeness. Abraham's contentment can be linked to his faith and obedience to God, which brought him blessings and a sense of purpose.<p><b>and was gathered to his people</b><br>This phrase is a euphemism for death, indicating a reunion with ancestors in the afterlife. It reflects the belief in an ongoing existence beyond physical death, where the faithful are united with their forebears. In the context of the patriarchs, it suggests a continuity of God's covenant promises through successive generations. This concept is echoed in later scriptures, such as when Jacob and Moses are described similarly at their deaths. It also prefigures the Christian hope of eternal life and reunion with the faithful in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Abraham is the patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
