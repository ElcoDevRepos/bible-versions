The ram's appearance signifies divine intervention and provision, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, such as in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The ram being caught by its horns suggests it was unblemished, suitable for sacrifice, aligning with Levitical laws (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). The thicket may symbolize the entanglements of sin, from which God provides deliverance. This event foreshadows the substitutionary atonement of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.</b><br>Abraham's action demonstrates obedience and faith, trusting God's promise that Isaac would be the heir (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>). The burnt offering, a complete sacrifice, signifies total dedication to God, as later detailed in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>. This substitution prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who died in our place (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>). The concept of substitutionary atonement is central to Christian theology, emphasizing that Christ's sacrifice fulfills the requirements of justice and mercy. Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac parallels God's willingness to sacrifice His own Son, highlighting the depth of divine love (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Abraham&#8217;s obedient faith meets God&#8217;s sovereign grace: the ram, perfect and ready, takes Isaac&#8217;s place. This moment not only spares the promised son but also foreshadows the greater Son, Jesus Christ, who will bear the thorns and die in our stead. The passage invites us to look up in trust, see God&#8217;s provision, and respond with wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Behind.</span>--By a slight change in the shape of a consonant, many ancient authorities read <span class= "ital">one ram </span>instead of <span class= "ital">a ram behind </span>("him" is not in the Hebrew). This correction is almost certain, as nowhere else is the word translated <span class= "ital">behind </span>used as an adverb of place. The ram was probably that with four horns, still common in the East.<p><span class= "bld">A burnt offering in the stead of his son.</span>--We have here the fact of substitution, and the doctrine of a vicarious sacrifice. The ram took Isaac's place, and by its actual death completed the typical representation of the Saviour's death on Calvary. In <span class= "ital">The Speaker's Commentary </span>it has been well shown, that there is no difficulty in this representation being composed of two parts, so that what was wanting in Isaac should be supplied by the ram. And while it would have been most painful for Isaac to have actually died by his father's hand, the doctrine of the possibility of a vicarious sacrifice would have been even less clearly taught thereby. He therefore rises again to life from the altar, and the ram dies in his stead, and by the two combined the whole mystery is set forth of God giving His Son to die for mankind, and of life springing from His death. Compare the mystery of the two birds, <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm" title="Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:">Leviticus 14:4</a>; and the two goats, <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm" title="And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.">Leviticus 16:8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham lifted up his eyes</span> (in the direction of the voice), <span class="cmt_word">and looked, and behold behind him</span> - either at his back (Furst, Keil, Lange, Murphy), or in the background of the altar, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in front of him (Gesenius, Kalisch).
