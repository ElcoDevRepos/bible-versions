The twenty years signify a significant portion of his life, emphasizing his dedication and the trials he faced. This period is a testament to his perseverance and faithfulness, despite the challenges and deceit he encountered from Laban. It also highlights the cultural norm of long-term servitude in exchange for marriage and wealth accumulation.<p><b>fourteen years for your two daughters</b><br>Jacob worked seven years each for Leah and Rachel, Laban's daughters. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of bride service, where a prospective husband would work for the bride's family as a form of dowry. The deception Jacob experienced, being given Leah instead of Rachel initially, mirrors his earlier deception of Esau, showing a theme of reaping what one sows.<p><b>and six years for your flocks&#8212;</b><br>The additional six years Jacob worked were for the purpose of building his own wealth through livestock. This period demonstrates Jacob's growing skill and wisdom in animal husbandry, which God blessed, leading to his prosperity. It also reflects the economic practices of the time, where wealth was often measured in livestock.<p><b>and you have changed my wages ten times!</b><br>Laban's repeated changes to Jacob's wages illustrate the ongoing deceit and exploitation Jacob faced. This phrase underscores the theme of divine justice and protection, as despite Laban's attempts to cheat him, God ensured Jacob's prosperity. The number ten can symbolize completeness or fullness, indicating the extent of Laban's treachery. This situation foreshadows the Israelites' later experiences in Egypt, where they were oppressed yet multiplied and prospered under God's care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and the central figure in this passage.

Jacob was willing to work&#8212;essentially paying a bride-price&#8212;mirroring later principles about honoring marriage commitments (<a href="/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; God redeemed even the unfair swap: from Leah and Rachel came the twelve tribes, showing that perseverance under injustice can yield unexpected blessing (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>---<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>six years for your flocks</b><p>&#8226; After the daughters came six more years focused on shepherding Laban&#8217;s herds (<a href="/genesis/30-25.htm">Genesis 30:25-43</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s honest diligence contrasts Laban&#8217;s shifting schemes; despite spotted and speckled breeding arrangements, the Lord multiplied Jacob&#8217;s portion (<a href="/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The passage models a believer&#8217;s work ethic: steady, skillful, trusting God for increase (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; It also highlights divine justice: &#8220;The wages you withheld&#8230;cry out&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>). God keeps accurate books even when earthly masters do not.<p>---<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you have changed my wages ten times!</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Ten times&#8221; signals repeated, deliberate exploitation (also stated in <a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>). Whether literally ten or idiomatically &#8220;over and over,&#8221; Jacob felt constant shifting of the goalposts.<p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s behavior violates later Mosaic commands against defrauding workers (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s protest anchors his righteousness: he never took what was not his, yet Laban kept revising terms. This foreshadows Israel&#8217;s complaints against Egypt&#8217;s oppression and God&#8217;s eventual deliverance (<a href="/exodus/5-7.htm">Exodus 5:7-9</a>; 6:6).<p>&#8226; The verse reassures believers who face unfair treatment: God notices every instance, protects the vulnerable (<a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>), and will ultimately vindicate the faithful (<a href="/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19-23</a>).<p>---<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a> records Jacob&#8217;s heartfelt ledger of service: twenty years total&#8212;fourteen for wives, six for flocks&#8212;set against ten wage changes. The verse highlights patient endurance under unjust authority, faithful labor rewarded by God, and divine oversight that rights wrongs in His time.
