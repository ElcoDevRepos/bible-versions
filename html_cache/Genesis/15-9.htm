It reflects the pattern of divine revelation seen throughout the Old Testament, where God speaks to His chosen individuals to guide and establish His purposes. This communication is foundational for the Abrahamic Covenant, a pivotal moment in biblical history.<p><b>Bring Me a heifer</b><br>The heifer, a young female cow, is significant in ancient sacrificial practices. In the context of Genesis, the heifer is part of a covenant ritual. The heifer's use in sacrifices is later seen in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>) and symbolizes purification and atonement. The heifer's role in this covenant foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who purifies believers from sin.<p><b>a goat</b><br>The goat is another animal commonly used in sacrificial offerings, representing sin and atonement. In <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, goats are used on the Day of Atonement, with one being sacrificed and the other, the scapegoat, symbolically carrying away the sins of the people. This prefigures Christ's atoning work, where He bears the sins of humanity.<p><b>and a ram</b><br>Rams are often associated with substitutionary sacrifice, as seen in the story of Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), where a ram is provided by God as a substitute for Isaac. This act of substitution is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate substitute for humanity's sins. The ram's inclusion in the covenant ritual underscores themes of provision and redemption.<p><b>each three years old</b><br>The specification of the animals being three years old suggests maturity and completeness, qualities necessary for a proper sacrifice. This detail highlights the importance of offering the best to God, a principle seen throughout Scripture. The number three often symbolizes divine completeness and perfection, pointing to the triune nature of God and the perfection of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>along with a turtledove and a young pigeon</b><br>These birds are included as part of the sacrificial offerings, often used by those who could not afford larger animals (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>). Their presence in the covenant ritual indicates God's provision for all, regardless of economic status. The use of birds in sacrifices is later seen in the purification rites of Mary after Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>), connecting the covenant with the coming of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is in a covenant dialogue with God. He is later renamed Abraham and is considered the father of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>God is speaking directly to Abram, instructing him on the covenant ritual. This interaction is part of God's unfolding plan for Abram and his descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_ceremony.htm">Covenant Ceremony</a></b><br>The event described is a covenant-making process, where specific animals are used in a ritual to formalize God's promises to Abram.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_covenant.htm">Understanding Covenant</a></b><br>The covenant is a solemn agreement that involves commitments and promises.

But in most ancient languages men are said to <span class= "ital">cut </span>or <span class= "ital">strike </span>a covenant, because the most solemn formula involved either the cutting of victims in two, or striking them dead, as was the Roman manner. The severing of the bodies was not, as some suppose, to represent the two parties; but, as explained in <a href="/context/jeremiah/34-18.htm" title="And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,">Jeremiah 34:18-20</a>, it set forth the penalty of perjury, and was usually accompanied by the imprecation upon the covenant-breaker of a destruction as complete as that which had befallen the slaughtered animals. There is no mention in this place of a sacrifice, although the animals are those subsequently set apart for sacrifice by the Levitical law. The heifer, she-goat, and ram at three years old would each have attained its full maturity; but there may be a further symbolic meaning in there being three animals each three years old.<p><span class= "bld">Laid each piece . . . --</span>More exactly, <span class= "ital">and laid each half over against the other. </span>The birds were not divided; but as there were two, Abram probably placed one on one side and one on the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Take me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">for</span> me, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for my use in sacrifice) <span class="cmt_word">an heifer of three years old</span>.
