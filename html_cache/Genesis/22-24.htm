The mention of a concubine reflects the cultural practices of the time, where concubinage was a socially accepted way to produce offspring.

This passage underscores the theme of God's promise to multiply Abraham's descendants, as Nahor's family also grows, setting the stage for future interactions between their descendants.

to make sure no person or branch of a family is overlooked (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/1-29.htm">1 Chronicles 1:29-33</a>).<p>&#8226; By including even seemingly minor details, the Spirit shows that every life is known and recorded (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nahor&#8217;s concubine</b><p>&#8226;

30:3-9).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores that children of a concubine still belong to the family line and will form future peoples (<a href="/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word records this without endorsing polygamy;
