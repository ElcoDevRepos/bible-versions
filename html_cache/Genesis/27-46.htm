Her communication with Isaac highlights the patriarchal structure where decisions are often discussed between husband and wife. This moment reflects the importance of marital unity in decision-making, especially concerning their children's futures.<p><b>I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women</b><br>Rebekah's weariness stems from Esau's marriages to Hittite women, which were a source of grief to both Isaac and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34-35</a>). The Hittites were part of the Canaanite tribes, and their practices and beliefs were often at odds with those of Abraham's descendants. This cultural and religious disparity caused tension and distress for Rebekah, who desired to maintain the covenantal purity of her lineage.<p><b>If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them</b><br>Rebekah's concern for Jacob's marital choice underscores the importance of marrying within the faith community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from pagan influences, as seen in Abraham's insistence on finding a wife for Isaac from his own kin (Genesis 24). The choice of a spouse was crucial for maintaining the covenant promises and spiritual heritage.<p><b>what good is my life?</b><br>Rebekah's rhetorical question emphasizes the gravity of the situation. Her life, intertwined with the covenant promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and their descendants, would seem futile if Jacob were to marry outside the faith. This reflects the deep-seated belief in the continuation of God's promises through a chosen lineage, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.
