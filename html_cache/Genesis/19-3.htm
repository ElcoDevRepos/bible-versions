This cultural norm is seen throughout the Bible, such as in Abraham's hospitality to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. Lot's urgency may also indicate his awareness of the city's wickedness and his desire to protect the visitors.<p><b>that they followed him into his house.</b><br>The act of bringing guests into one's home was a significant gesture of protection and honor. In the context of Sodom, a city known for its sinfulness, Lot's home becomes a place of refuge. This mirrors the concept of sanctuary, where God's people are called to be a light in dark places.<p><b>He prepared a feast for them</b><br>The preparation of a feast signifies respect and honor towards the guests. This act of generosity is reminiscent of the hospitality shown by Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6-8</a>. The feast symbolizes fellowship and communion, themes that are echoed in the New Testament, such as the Last Supper.<p><b>and baked unleavened bread,</b><br>Unleavened bread, often associated with haste, is significant in the biblical narrative. It is a precursor to the Passover meal in <a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>, symbolizing purity and separation from sin. This detail may foreshadow the impending judgment on Sodom and the urgency of the situation.<p><b>and they ate.</b><br>The act of eating together signifies acceptance and peace. In biblical times, sharing a meal was a covenantal act, indicating trust and relationship. This moment of fellowship contrasts with the later events in Sodom, highlighting the stark difference between Lot's hospitality and the city's wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>A righteous man living in Sodom, Abraham's nephew, who shows hospitality to the visiting angels.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom.htm">Sodom</a></b><br>A city known for its wickedness, where Lot resides.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Divine messengers sent by God to Sodom to assess its wickedness and deliver Lot and his family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot's_house.htm">Lot's House</a></b><br>The setting for the hospitality Lot extends to the angels, contrasting the wickedness of Sodom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unleavened_bread.htm">Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A simple meal prepared by Lot, symbolizing haste and purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_hospitality.htm">The Importance of Hospitality</a></b><br>Lot's insistence on hosting the angels demonstrates the biblical value of hospitality, even in a corrupt environment.
