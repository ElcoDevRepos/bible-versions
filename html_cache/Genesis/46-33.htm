The summoning by Pharaoh indicates the importance of the meeting, as Pharaoh was the most powerful figure in Egypt. This reflects the high status Joseph had achieved, allowing his family to have an audience with the king. Historically, Egypt was a powerful and advanced civilization, and Pharaohs were considered divine figures. This context highlights the gravity of the situation for Jacob's family, who were shepherds from Canaan.<p><b>&#8216;What is your occupation?&#8217;</b><br>The question about occupation is crucial in the context of ancient Egypt. Shepherds were often looked down upon by Egyptians, as seen in <a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>, where Joseph advises his brothers to say they are keepers of livestock rather than shepherds. This distinction was important because Egyptians considered shepherds to be an abomination (<a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>). The occupation of Joseph's family as shepherds also connects to their identity as Hebrews, a nomadic people with a pastoral lifestyle. This question foreshadows the separation of the Israelites in the land of Goshen, which would allow them to maintain their distinct cultural and religious identity. The theme of occupation also ties into the broader biblical narrative of God using humble beginnings and professions to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like David, who was a shepherd before becoming king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is moving his family to Egypt during a time of famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's son, who has risen to a position of power in Egypt and is orchestrating the relocation of his family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who will meet Jacob's family and inquire about their occupation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Jacob's family is moving to find sustenance during the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_famine.htm">The Famine</a></b><br>A severe famine affecting the region, prompting Jacob's family to seek refuge in Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_and_occupation.htm">Identity and Occupation</a></b><br>Understanding one's identity in Christ is crucial, just as Jacob's family needed to be clear about their occupation when meeting Pharaoh.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>Trust in God's provision, as He provided for Jacob's family through Joseph's position in Egypt.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_transition.htm">Faith in Transition</a></b><br>Like Jacob's family moving to Egypt, believers often face transitions that require faith and trust in God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_engagement.htm">Cultural Engagement</a></b><br>Engaging with different cultures, as Jacob's family did with the Egyptians, requires wisdom and discernment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_the_future.htm">Preparation for the Future</a></b><br>Just as Joseph prepared his family for their meeting with Pharaoh, believers should prepare for future challenges by grounding themselves in Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_46_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 46:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_46_33_God_s_provision_in_Egypt.htm">How does Genesis 46:33 demonstrate God's provision for Jacob's family in Egypt?

Pharaoh's inquiry was characteristically Egyptian, being rendered necessary by the strict distinction of castes that then prevailed. According to a law promulgated by Amasis, a monarch of the 26th dynasty, every Egyptian was obliged to give a yearly account to the monarch or State governor of how he lived, with the certification that if he failed to show that he possessed an honorable calling (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) he should be put to death (Herod., 2:177). <span class="cmt_word">That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle</span> (literally, men <span class="accented">of cattle arc thy servants</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen.</span> Joseph probably desired his brethren to settle in Goshen for three reasons. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It was suitable for their flocks and herds; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it would secure their isolation from the Egyptians; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it was contiguous to Canaan, and would be easier vacated when the time arrived for their return. <span class="cmt_word">For every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</span> These are obviously the words not of Joseph, but of the historian, and their accuracy is strikingly corroborated by Herodotus (2. 47, 164), who affirms that the swine-herds, one of the seven castes, classes, or guilds into which the Egyptians were divided, were regarded with such abhorrence that they were not allowed to enter a temple or contract marriage with any others of their countrymen; and by existing monuments, which show that though the statement of Josephus ('Ant.,' 2:07, 5) is incorrect that "the Egyptians were prohibited from meddling with the keeping of sheep,' yet those, who tended cattle were greatly despised, Egyptian artists evincing the contempt in which they were held by frequently representing them as either lame or deformed, dirty and unshaven, and sometimes of a most ludicrous appearance (<span class="accented">vide</span> Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. p. 444, ed. 1878).
