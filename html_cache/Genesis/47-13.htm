Famines were not uncommon in the ancient Near East due to reliance on seasonal rains and the Nile's inundation. This particular famine was prophesied by Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-30.htm">Genesis 41:30</a>) and serves as a backdrop for God's providential care for His people. The lack of food emphasizes the dire circumstances that led to the centralization of power in Egypt under Joseph's administration.<p><b>because the famine was so severe</b><br>The severity of the famine underscores the fulfillment of Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-32</a>). It was a divine orchestration to bring Jacob's family to Egypt, setting the stage for the Israelites' eventual growth into a great nation. The famine's intensity also serves as a reminder of human vulnerability and the need for reliance on God's provision.<p><b>the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine</b><br>This phrase indicates the widespread impact of the famine, affecting both Egypt and Canaan. Egypt, typically a breadbasket due to the Nile, was also suffering, which highlights the extraordinary nature of this famine. Canaan's inclusion shows the interconnectedness of the region and sets the stage for the Israelites' migration to Egypt. This movement is significant in biblical history, as it fulfills God's promise to Abraham about his descendants' sojourn in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The exhaustion of the lands also prefigures the spiritual barrenness that can occur without God's intervention, pointing to the need for a savior, a role ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>As the governor of Egypt, Joseph was responsible for managing the resources during the famine.
