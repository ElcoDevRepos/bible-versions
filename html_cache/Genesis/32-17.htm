This reflects his cautious and diplomatic approach, aiming to appease Esau's potential anger. The act of sending messengers or gifts ahead was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures to show respect or seek favor.<p><b>When my brother Esau meets you</b><br>Jacob refers to Esau as "my brother," emphasizing their familial bond despite past conflicts. This encounter is significant, as it follows their separation after Jacob's deception to receive Isaac's blessing. The meeting is set in the region of Edom, where Esau settled, highlighting the geographical separation that mirrored their relational distance.<p><b>and asks, &#8216;To whom do you belong</b><br>This question reflects the social structure of the time, where individuals were often identified by their family or clan. It underscores the importance of lineage and belonging in ancient societies, where one's identity was closely tied to their family.<p><b>where are you going</b><br>This inquiry about destination indicates a concern for the intentions of travelers, especially in a time when movement could imply trade, migration, or conflict. It also reflects the cultural norm of hospitality, where understanding a traveler's purpose was essential for offering appropriate assistance or protection.<p><b>and whose animals are these before you?&#8217;</b><br>The mention of animals highlights the wealth and status associated with livestock in the ancient world. Jacob's possession of numerous animals signifies his prosperity, which he uses as a peace offering to Esau. This act of sending gifts ahead is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where gifts are used to secure favor or reconciliation, such as Abigail's offering to David in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

"Jacob did not miscalculate the influence of his princely offerings, and I verily believe there is not an emeer or sheikh in all Gilead at this day who would not be appeased by such presents; and from my personal knowledge of Orientals, I should say that Jacob need not have been in such great terror, following in their rear.
