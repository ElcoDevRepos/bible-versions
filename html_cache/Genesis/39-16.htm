The cloak, a piece of evidence she uses to falsely accuse Joseph, symbolizes the deceit and manipulation she employs. This act of keeping the cloak is reminiscent of the earlier incident where Joseph's brothers used his coat to deceive their father, Jacob, into believing Joseph was dead. The cloak represents Joseph's vulnerability and the recurring theme of garments in his life, which often signify changes in his status and circumstances.<p><b>until his master came home.</b><br>The phrase indicates a waiting period, suggesting premeditation and the seriousness of the accusation she plans to make. Potiphar, as an Egyptian official, would have had significant responsibilities, and his return home marks a pivotal moment in the narrative. The cultural context of ancient Egypt, where household servants were expected to be loyal and trustworthy, heightens the gravity of the accusation against Joseph. This moment foreshadows the impending trial Joseph will face, drawing parallels to the trials of Jesus Christ, who was also falsely accused and suffered unjustly. The anticipation of Potiphar's return underscores the tension and impending conflict in the story.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, known for his integrity and faithfulness to God.
