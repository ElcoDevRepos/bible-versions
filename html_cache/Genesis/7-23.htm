It reflects the severity of God's judgment on a world that had become exceedingly wicked (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>). The phrase "every living thing" underscores the comprehensive nature of the flood, affecting all forms of life. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, demonstrating God's holiness and justice. It serves as a precursor to future judgments, such as those described in Revelation, where God's wrath is again poured out on a sinful world.<p><b>man and livestock, crawling creatures and birds of the air;</b><br>The specific mention of "man and livestock, crawling creatures and birds of the air" highlights the breadth of the destruction. This mirrors the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God created these categories of life. The flood acts as a reversal of creation, where the order established by God is undone due to human sin. This phrase also serves to remind readers of the interconnectedness of creation and humanity's role as stewards of the earth, a role that was corrupted by sin.<p><b>they were blotted out from the earth,</b><br>The term "blotted out" conveys a sense of erasure or removal, indicating the thoroughness of the flood's impact. This language is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern texts where divine judgment often involved the removal of life. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the extent to which God will go to purify His creation. This phrase also foreshadows the final judgment, where those not found in the Book of Life are similarly "blotted out" (<a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>).<p><b>and only Noah and those with him in the ark remained.</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of divine grace and salvation. Noah, described as a righteous man (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>), found favor in God's eyes and was preserved along with his family and the animals in the ark. The ark serves as a type of Christ, providing salvation and refuge from judgment. Just as Noah and his family were saved through the ark, believers are saved through faith in Jesus Christ. This remnant theology is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God preserves a faithful group through whom He continues His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve life on earth.

The straits to which the advocates of the documentary hypothesis are sometimes reduced are remarkably exemplified by the fortunes of these verses (21-23) in the attempt to assign them to their respective authors. Astruc conjectures that ver. 21 was taken from what he calls monumentum B, ver. 22 from "monument" A, and ver. 23 from monument C. Eichhorn ascribes vers. 21, 22 to an Elohistic author, and ver. 23 to a Jehovistic. Ilgen assigns vers. 21, 22 to the first, and ver. 23 to the second Elohist. Bleek, all three to the Elohist; and Davidson ver. 21 to the Elohist, vers. 22, 23 to the Jehovist. Amid such uncertainty it will be reasonable to cling to the belief that Moses wrote all the three verses, at least till the higher criticism knows its own mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/7-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">living thing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;
