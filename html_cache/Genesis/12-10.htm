In the biblical narrative, famines are sometimes used by God to direct His people to new locations or to bring about significant events. This particular famine occurs in Canaan, the land promised to Abram by God, highlighting the tension between divine promise and present reality. Famines in Scripture often symbolize spiritual barrenness or a time of testing, as seen in the story of Joseph (Genesis 41) and the famine during the time of Elijah (1 Kings 17).<p><b>So Abram went down to Egypt</b><br>Egypt, with its Nile River, was a fertile land and often a refuge during times of famine. This journey marks the first of several significant interactions between the Hebrews and Egypt, foreshadowing future events such as the Israelites' enslavement and the Exodus. Abram's decision to go to Egypt reflects a common practice of seeking sustenance in more prosperous regions during times of scarcity. This move also sets the stage for Abram's subsequent challenges and God's intervention.<p><b>to live there for a while</b><br>Abram's intention to stay temporarily indicates his awareness of God's promise concerning Canaan. However, this decision also reflects a reliance on human wisdom rather than seeking divine guidance. The temporary nature of his stay suggests a lack of permanence and foreshadows the transient nature of the Israelites' later sojourns. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's journey through life, living as sojourners in a world that is not their ultimate home.<p><b>because the famine was severe.</b><br>The severity of the famine underscores the desperation and urgency of Abram's situation. It highlights the challenges faced by those who follow God's call, as even the land of promise can experience hardship. This severity serves as a backdrop for the unfolding narrative, where Abram's faith and character are tested. The mention of a severe famine also connects to other biblical accounts where God uses difficult circumstances to fulfill His purposes, such as the story of Ruth and Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>) and the trials faced by the early church (<a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.

The sudden mention of famine underscores that even within God&#8217;s will, trials immediately arise (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture treats famines as instruments God uses to move His purposes forward (<a href="/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56-57</a>). Here, famine becomes the catalyst that propels Abram farther from home and deeper into dependence on the Lord.<p>&#8226; Similar patterns recur later: Isaac faces famine and receives guidance (<a href="/genesis/26-1.htm">Genesis 26:1-3</a>); Jacob&#8217;s family is driven to Egypt by famine, setting the stage for the Exodus (<a href="/genesis/47-4.htm">Genesis 47:4</a>). Each time, God&#8217;s covenant plan keeps advancing despite apparent setbacks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Abram went down to Egypt</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Went down&#8221; is more than a geographical note; Egypt&#8217;s fertile Nile valley often drew people when Canaan lacked food (cf. <a href="/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>). Abram acts pragmatically, yet Scripture never criticizes the decision to seek sustenance.<p>&#8226; Egypt will reappear throughout the Bible as both refuge and snare. Isaiah later warns, &#8220;Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>), yet God also used Egypt to preserve His people (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Abram&#8217;s move foreshadows Israel&#8217;s own descent and eventual Exodus. God is already sketching the outline of salvation history through Abram&#8217;s personal journey.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to live there for a while because the famine was severe</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;for a while&#8221; signals temporary intent&#8212;Abram is not abandoning the promised land but seeking survival until the crisis passes (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Severity of famine justifies the relocation; Scripture records no rebuke from God, emphasizing that practical steps do not nullify faith when taken without sin (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Nevertheless, Egypt will test Abram&#8217;s trust, leading to the episode with Sarai (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11-20</a>). God allows the pressure to reveal both His faithfulness and Abram&#8217;s need for continued growth (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern repeats in later narratives: Elijah sojourns in Zarephath during drought (<a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8-16</a>); Joseph stores grain in Egypt &#8220;for five years of famine&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6-7</a>). God&#8217;s people frequently find provisional shelter while awaiting the fulfillment of greater promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a> shows the immediate testing that follows Abram&#8217;s call. A literal famine drives him from the land he has just entered, pushing him into Egypt&#8217;s temporary shelter. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s promises do not exempt believers from hardship; instead, trials become tools to advance His sovereign plan. In every famine&#8212;ancient or modern&#8212;He remains faithful, guiding His people and using even their detours to unfold His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>ABRAM'S VISIT TO EGYPT.</span><p>(10) <span class= "bld">There was a famine in the land.</span>--This famine must have happened within a few years after Abram reached Canaan; for he was seventy-five years of age on leaving Haran, and as Ishmael, his son by an Egyptian slave-woman, was thirteen years old when Abram was ninety-nine, only about eight years are left for the events recorded in Genesis 12-16. As rain falls in Palestine only at two periods of the year, the failure of either of these seasons would be immediately felt, especially in a dry region like the Negeb, and at a time when, with no means of bringing food from a distance, men had to depend upon the annual products of the land. As Egypt is watered by the flooding of the Nile, caused by the heavy rains which fall in Abyssinia, it probably had not suffered from what was a mere local failure in South Palestine; and Abram, already far on his way to Egypt, was forced by the necessity of providing fodder for his cattle to run the risk of proceeding thither. In Canaan he had found a thinly scattered Canaanite population, for whom probably he would have been a match in war; in Egypt he would find a powerful empire, and would be at the mercy of its rulers. It is a proof of Abram's faith that in this necessity he neither retraced his steps (<a href="/hebrews/11-15.htm" title="And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.">Hebrews 11:15</a>), nor sought a new home. For he went to Egypt with no intention of settling, but only "to sojourn there," to remain there for a brief period, after which with returning rains he would go back to Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a famine</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, from a root signifying to hunger, the primary. idea appearing to lie in that of an ample, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> empty, stomach (Gesenius, Furst). The term is used of individuals, men or animal (<a href="/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>); or of regions (Psalm 41:55). <span class="cmt_word">In the land</span>. Of Canaan, which, though naturally fertile, was, on account of its imperfect cultivation, subject to visitations of dearth (cf. <a href="/genesis/26-1.htm">Genesis 26:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56</a>), especially in dry seasons, when the November and December rains, on which Palestine depended, either failed or were scanty. The occurrence of this famine just at the time of Abram's entering the land was an additional trial to his faith. <span class="cmt_word">And Abram went down to Egypt</span>. Mizraim (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 10:6) was lower than Palestine, and celebrated then, as later, as a rich and fruitful country, though sometimes even Egypt suffered from a scarcity of corn, owing to a failure in the annual inundation of the Nile. Eichhorn notes it as an authentication of this portion of the Abrahamic history that the patriarch proposed to take himself and his household to Egypt, since at that time no corn trade existed between the two countries such as prevailed in the days of Jacob (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick's Introduction, &sect; 18). The writer to the Hebrews remarks it as an instance of the patriarch's faith that he did not return to either Haran or Ur (<a href="/hebrews/11-15.htm">Hebrews 11:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To sojourn there</span>. To tarry as a stranger, but not to dwell. Whether this journey was undertaken with the Divine sanction and ought to be regarded as an act of faith, or in obedience to his own fears and should be reckoned as a sign of unbelief, does not appear. Whichever way the patriarch elected to act in his perplexity, to leave Canaan or reside in it, there was clearly a strain intended to be put upon his faith. <span class="cmt_word">For the famine was grievous</span> (literally, <span class="accented">heavy</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the land</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
