In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often measured in terms of livestock and possessions. The desire to acquire Jacob's wealth through intermarriage with his family highlights the materialistic and opportunistic nature of their intentions. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of covetousness and the dangers of prioritizing material gain over righteousness, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which warns against the love of money.<p><b>Only let us consent to them,</b><br>The phrase "let us consent to them" indicates a willingness to agree to the terms set by Jacob's sons, which involved circumcision. This reflects the cultural practice of making covenants or agreements, often sealed by a physical sign or ritual. In this case, circumcision was a significant religious and cultural marker for the Israelites, symbolizing their covenant with God (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). The willingness of the Shechemites to undergo circumcision for economic and social integration underscores the superficial nature of their commitment, contrasting with the deeper spiritual significance it held for the Israelites.<p><b>and they will dwell among us.&#8221;</b><br>The promise that "they will dwell among us" suggests a desire for integration and coexistence between the Shechemites and Jacob's family. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the tension between God's people and surrounding nations. Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous instances where the Israelites are warned against assimilating with pagan cultures, which could lead to idolatry and moral compromise (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The proposal here foreshadows the potential for such compromise, highlighting the importance of maintaining distinctiveness as God's chosen people. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>- A city in the land of Canaan, significant in biblical history as a place of covenant and conflict.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>- The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince, who seeks to negotiate with Jacob's family for the marriage of his son to Dinah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>- The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, father of Dinah, and a central figure in the unfolding events.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>- The daughter of Jacob and Leah, whose defilement by Shechem sets off the events of <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_jacob.htm">The Sons of Jacob</a></b><br>- Particularly Simeon and Levi, who respond deceitfully and violently to the situation with Shechem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>The proposal by Hamor reflects a worldly perspective that values material gain over spiritual integrity.

He&#8217;s appealing to the townsmen&#8217;s sense of profit, not friendship (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-14</a>, where enticement to gain through others&#8217; goods is condemned). Jacob&#8217;s family had grown rich in livestock (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>), so Hamor&#8217;s question dangles a sizable payday before his listeners.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their possessions</b><p>The lure widens&#8212;everything Jacob&#8217;s clan owns is up for grabs. Like Ahab eyeing Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21-2.htm">1 Kings 21:2-3</a>), Hamor covets what is not his. Scripture repeatedly warns against such greed (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>). Here it drives a community decision that will end in tragedy once Simeon and Levi expose the deceit (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all their animals</b><p>Repeating the theme underscores just how large the potential gain appears. The wording recalls Lot choosing the fertile plain of Jordan for its immediate advantage (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10-11</a>) while ignoring the moral cost. Hamor is measuring only in livestock and assets, not in righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>become ours?</b><p>This rhetorical flourish seals the bait. Hamor speaks as though possession is inevitable, echoing Esau&#8217;s earlier boast &#8220;I am on my way to die, so why do I need a birthright?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-32.htm">Genesis 25:32</a>). Both statements reveal hearts set on the material rather than the spiritual and foreshadow loss instead of gain (cf. <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Only let us consent to them</b><p>The proposed price is circumcision, a uniquely covenant sign with God (<a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>). Hamor reduces a holy mark to a business transaction, treating sacred things as common (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a>). His call echoes Saul&#8217;s pragmatic obedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>&#8212;&#8220;I listened to the voice of the people&#8221;&#8212;rather than submission to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they will dwell among us</b><p>Hamor promises peaceful coexistence, but the chapter shows sin&#8217;s ripple effect when motives are wrong. Israel living &#8220;among&#8221; the nations is meant to be a blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), yet here it spirals into violence because neither side seeks God&#8217;s honor. Later commands will urge separation from corrupt practices (<a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>) precisely to prevent such compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a> exposes a heart-level greed that disguises itself as diplomacy. Hamor counts Jacob&#8217;s wealth and sees an opportunity, not a relationship. Each phrase layers the enticement: livestock, possessions, every animal&#8212;&#8220;all will be ours if we just agree.&#8221; Scripture&#8217;s cross-currents warn that any alliance founded on covetousness and disregard for God&#8217;s covenant signs invites judgment, not blessing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their livestock,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1492;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
