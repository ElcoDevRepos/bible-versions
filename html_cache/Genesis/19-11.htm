The angels' intervention demonstrates divine protection over Lot and his family. The entrance of Lot's house symbolizes a boundary between safety and the wickedness of Sodom. This act of striking the men highlights the power of God to protect His people and execute judgment. The entrance is significant as it represents the threshold between the righteous and the wicked, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>).<p><b>young and old</b><br>The mention of "young and old" emphasizes the pervasive corruption in Sodom, indicating that the entire population, regardless of age, was complicit in the city's sinfulness. This reflects the total depravity of Sodom, similar to the widespread wickedness before the flood (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). It underscores the need for divine judgment and the extent of moral decay that had permeated the society.<p><b>with blindness</b><br>The blindness inflicted upon the men is both physical and spiritual. Physically, it prevents them from carrying out their evil intentions. Spiritually, it symbolizes their moral and spiritual blindness, unable to perceive the truth or recognize the divine presence among them. This act of blinding is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God blinds individuals to protect His purposes, such as the Arameans in <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a>.<p><b>so that they wearied themselves trying to find the door</b><br>This phrase illustrates the futility of opposing God's will. Despite their efforts, the men are unable to achieve their wicked goals. The door represents salvation and refuge, which they cannot access due to their blindness and sin. This mirrors the spiritual truth that without divine intervention, humanity is unable to find the "door" to salvation, which Jesus later identifies Himself as in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>. The weariness of the men also serves as a metaphor for the exhaustion that comes from pursuing sin, contrasting with the rest found in obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>A righteous man living in Sodom, who is the nephew of Abraham.

Immediately after Lot pulls him-self back in and closes the door (<a href="/genesis/19-10.htm">Genesis 19:10</a>), the angels act. Their striking is a decisive, supernatural intervention&#8212;no hesitation, no partial measure. Similar swift angelic judgments appear in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a> and <a href="/acts/12-23.htm">Acts 12:23</a>, underscoring that heavenly messengers can execute God&#8217;s justice instantly when human life or covenant purpose is threatened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the men at the entrance</b><p>Only those gathered at the doorway are affected, confirming God&#8217;s precision. The attackers had surrounded the house (<a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>), yet the blow lands exactly where the danger is greatest. Compare <a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7, 12</a>, where judgment bypasses protected households, or <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>, where the LORD promises to keep His people &#8220;from all evil&#8230; both now and forevermore.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>young and old</b><p>The phrase reveals the depth of Sodom&#8217;s corruption&#8212;sin crosses generational lines. <a href="/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a> speaks of a society in collapse when &#8220;the young will make captives of the old.&#8221; Here, both ages jointly pursue depravity. <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-18</a> reminds us that, left to ourselves, &#8220;there is no one righteous.&#8221; Sodom illustrates total moral breakdown; God&#8217;s judgment is therefore both righteous and comprehensive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with blindness</b><p>This is literal, physical blindness, inflicted instantly. <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a> shows a parallel miracle when Elisha prays and Aramean soldiers are struck blind. In both events:<p>&#8226; The blindness protects God&#8217;s servants.<p>&#8226; It halts evil plans without immediate lethal force.<p>&#8226; It mirrors spiritual blindness (<a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), hinting that those who reject God&#8217;s light stumble in darkness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that they wearied themselves</b><p>The attackers do not repent; they simply grow exhausted. <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a> pictures hardened hearts &#8220;excluded from the life of God.&#8221; Their weariness exposes how sin depletes energy and purpose while offering no reward (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). Even under judgment, the unregenerate often persist rather than turn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>trying to find the door</b><p>Ironically, the very door they sought to batter becomes unreachable. Jesus later declares, &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). Sodom&#8217;s men grope for entry to satisfy lust; the gospel invites us to a door of salvation by faith. <a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a> warns that many will seek to enter and not be able. <a href="/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a> foreshadows that sobering reality: refusal of God&#8217;s way leaves a person shut out, blinded, and exhausted in vain efforts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a> records a surgical act of divine judgment that protects the righteous, exposes pervasive sin, and previews the ultimate peril of spiritual blindness. God&#8217;s angels strike only the guilty; everyone&#8212;from youth to elder&#8212;is accountable; physical blindness mirrors inner darkness; persistent sin leads to weariness; and the true door of safety remains closed to those who reject God&#8217;s light.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Blindness.</span>--This word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm" title="And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray you, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.">2Kings 6:18</a>, and in both cases it is plain that actual blindness is not meant. Had the men here been struck with blindness they would not have wearied themselves with trying to find the door, but would either have gone away in terror at the visitation, or, if too hardened for that, would have groped about till they found it. So, if the Syrian army had been made actually blind, they would have surrendered themselves; nor would it have been practicable to guide an army of blind men on so long a march as that from Dothan to Samaria. In both cases the men were unaware that anything had happened to them. The people of Sodom thought they saw the door; the Syrians supposed that the locality was one well known to them, and only when the confusion was removed did they become conscious that they were at Samaria. The word really means a disturbance of vision caused by the eye not being in its proper connection with the brain. And so the men of Sodom ever seemed just upon the point of reaching the door, and pressed on, and strove and quarrelled, but always failed, they knew not how, but as they always supposed by one another's fault. It is a strange picture of men given over to unbelief and sin, and who "seeing see not," because they reject the true light.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they smote the men that were at the door</span> - the <span class="accented">pethaeh</span>, or opening (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 6) - <span class="cmt_word">of the house with blindness</span>, - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (sanverim), from an unused quadrilateral signifying to dazzle, is perhaps here intended not for natural blindness, but for confused or bewildered vision, involving for the time being loss of sight, and accompanied by mental aberration;
