The context of this birth is significant as it follows a series of events involving Judah and Tamar, highlighting themes of justice and redemption. The birth of twins is a notable event in biblical narratives, often symbolizing conflict or competition, as seen with Jacob and Esau.<p><b>one of them put out his hand</b><br>The act of one twin extending his hand first is unusual and sets the stage for the unexpected outcome of the birth. This moment foreshadows the reversal of expectations, a common biblical theme where God's plans often subvert human assumptions. It also introduces the idea of struggle and precedence, reminiscent of the struggle between Jacob and Esau.<p><b>so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his wrist</b><br>The scarlet thread serves as a marker of identity and precedence, indicating which child was technically the firstborn. The use of a scarlet thread is symbolic, often associated with themes of redemption and sacrifice, as seen in the story of Rahab (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18</a>) and the blood of Christ. This act by the midwife reflects the cultural importance of birth order in inheritance rights and family lineage.<p><b>&#8220;This one came out first,&#8221; she announced</b><br>The midwife's declaration underscores the importance of the firstborn in ancient Near Eastern culture, where the firstborn son typically received a double portion of the inheritance and held a place of honor. However, the narrative soon reveals a twist, as the other twin, Perez, ultimately emerges first, illustrating the biblical motif of the younger surpassing the elder, as seen in the stories of Isaac over Ishmael and Jacob over Esau. This theme points to God's sovereignty in choosing leaders and fulfilling His promises, often through unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The mother of the twins, Perez and Zerah, who plays a crucial role in the lineage of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The father of the twins, whose lineage is significant in the history of Israel and the genealogy of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/perez_and_zerah.htm">Perez and Zerah</a></b><br>The twin sons of Judah and Tamar, whose birth is marked by an unusual event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/midwife.htm">Midwife</a></b><br>The unnamed woman assisting in the birth, who ties a scarlet thread around the wrist of the firstborn.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scarlet_thread.htm">Scarlet Thread</a></b><br>A symbol used to identify the firstborn, which plays a role in the account of the twins' birth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_unusual_circumstances.htm">God's Sovereignty in Unusual Circumstances</a></b><br>The birth of Perez and Zerah, with its unexpected twist, reminds us that God's plans often unfold in ways we do not anticipate.
