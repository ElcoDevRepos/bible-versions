Jacob, also known as Israel, is moving his entire family to Egypt due to a severe famine in Canaan. This relocation fulfills God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would sojourn in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). Egypt, a powerful and prosperous nation at the time, becomes a place of refuge. This move sets the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and the subsequent Exodus, a pivotal event in biblical history.<p><b>his sons and grandsons</b><br>Jacob's sons are the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their names and families are listed in <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-27</a>, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant with Abraham through Jacob's lineage. The mention of grandsons highlights the growth of Jacob's family, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham's descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). This generational detail underscores the importance of family and heritage in the biblical narrative.<p><b>and his daughters and granddaughters</b><br>While the Bible often focuses on male lineage, the inclusion of daughters and granddaughters here indicates the comprehensive nature of Jacob's family migration. This reflects the cultural context where family units, including women and children, were integral to tribal identity and survival. Although fewer women are named, their presence is essential for the continuation of the family line and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>all his offspring</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of Jacob's family moving to Egypt, signifying a complete transition from Canaan to a new life in a foreign land. It highlights the unity and collective identity of Jacob's family as they embark on this journey. This move is a precursor to the formation of the nation of Israel, as all of Jacob's descendants will eventually become the people who receive the Law at Sinai and enter the Promised Land. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual multiplication of Jacob's descendants in Egypt, fulfilling God's promise of a great nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite nation, who is moving his entire family to Egypt in response to Joseph's invitation and God's promise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_grandsons.htm">Sons and Grandsons</a></b><br>The male descendants of Jacob, who are part of the fulfillment of God's promise to make Jacob's descendants a great nation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_and_granddaughters.htm">Daughters and Granddaughters</a></b><br>The female descendants of Jacob, included in the migration to Egypt, highlighting the importance of the entire family unit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph has risen to power and where Jacob's family will find refuge during the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's son, who has become a powerful leader in Egypt and is instrumental in bringing his family to safety.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Jacob's move to Egypt demonstrates his trust in God's promises, even when circumstances are uncertain.
