Egypt, a land of abundance and power, contrasts with Canaan, the land of promise. The brothers' journey "up" signifies a return to their roots and the fulfillment of God's promises to their forefathers. This movement from Egypt to Canaan foreshadows the future Exodus, where the Israelites will leave Egypt under Moses' leadership. The brothers' journey also reflects a spiritual ascent, moving from a place of past guilt and deception to reconciliation and truth.<p><b>and came to their father Jacob</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, is the patriarch of the twelve tribes. His sons' return to him is not just a physical reunion but a restoration of family unity. Jacob's life has been marked by struggle and divine encounters, and this moment is a culmination of God's faithfulness to him. The return of his sons, especially with the news of Joseph, whom he thought dead, is a pivotal moment in his life. This reunion prefigures the ultimate reconciliation between God and His people, as seen in the New Testament through Christ.<p><b>in the land of Canaan</b><br>Canaan is the land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants. It is a land rich in biblical history and significance, representing God's covenant and faithfulness. The return to Canaan signifies a return to the place of promise and destiny. This land is central to the biblical narrative, being the setting for many key events in Israel's history. Theologically, Canaan represents the believer's journey to the promises of God, a place of spiritual inheritance and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.

And Jacob's (literally, <span class="accented">his, i.e.</span> Jacob's) heart fainted (literally, <span class="accented">A few chill</span>, the primary idea of the root being that of rigidity through coldness; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, to be rigid, and <span class="accented">pigeo, rigeo, frigeo</span>, to be chill. The sense is that Jacob s heart seemed to stop with amazement at the tidings which his sons brought), for he believed them not. This was scarcely a case of believing not for joy (Bush), but rather of incredulity arising from suspicion, both of the messengers and their message, which was only removed by further explanation, and in particular by the sight of Joseph's splendid presents and commodious carriages. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about Joseph's invitation and promise (vers. 9-11) - and when he saw the wagons - probably royal vehicles (Wordsworth) - which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived (literally, <span class="accented">lived</span>; it having been previously numb and cold, as if dead): and Israel said, - the change of name here is significant. The sublime theocratic designation, which had dropped into obscurity during the period of the old man's sorrow for his lost son, revives with the resuscitation of his dead hope (cf. <a href="/genesis/43-6.htm">Genesis 43:6</a>) - It is enough (one word, as if expressing his complacent satisfaction); Joseph my son is yet alive (this is the one thought that fills his aged heart): I will go down - "The old man is young again in spirit; he is for going immediately; he could leap; yes, fly" (Lange) - and see him (a sight of Joseph would be ample compensation for all the years of sorrow he had passed through) before I die. He would then be ready to be gathered to his fathers. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/45-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [the brothers] went up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">out of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Canaan.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;na&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3667.htm">Strong's 3667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Canaan -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their land West of the Jordan</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/45-25.htm">OT Law: Genesis 45:25 They went up out of Egypt (Gen.
