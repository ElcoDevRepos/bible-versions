The phrase indicates that he had not engaged in any intimate relations with Sarah, Abraham's wife. This detail is crucial as it underscores Abimelech's innocence in the situation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings often took women into their harems, but Abimelech's restraint here is significant. It highlights the divine intervention that prevented him from sinning unknowingly. This also reflects God's protection over Sarah and the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham regarding his offspring.<p><b>so he replied,</b><br>Abimelech's response is directed towards God, indicating a direct communication with the divine. This interaction suggests that God had revealed the truth to Abimelech in a dream, a common means of divine communication in the Old Testament. Dreams were often seen as a medium through which God conveyed His will or warnings, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Joseph's dreams in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a> and Pharaoh's dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?</b><br>Abimelech's plea to God reflects a deep understanding of divine justice. The use of "Lord" signifies recognition of God's sovereignty and authority. The question posed by Abimelech echoes the intercessory dialogue between Abraham and God regarding Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, where Abraham questions if God would destroy the righteous with the wicked. This rhetorical question implies that Abimelech sees his nation as innocent in this matter, as they acted without knowledge of Sarah's true marital status. It also highlights the broader biblical theme of God's justice and mercy, where God is portrayed as a righteous judge who considers the innocence or guilt of individuals and nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The king of Gerar, who unknowingly took Sarah, Abraham's wife, into his household, believing she was Abraham's sister.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>Abraham's wife, who was taken by Abimelech due to Abraham's misleading claim that she was his sister.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who, out of fear for his life, misled Abimelech by saying Sarah was his sister.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gerar.htm">Gerar</a></b><br>A Philistine city where Abimelech ruled and where the events of this chapter take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_intervention.htm">God's Intervention</a></b><br>God intervenes by warning Abimelech in a dream, preventing him from sinning against Him by taking Sarah as his wife.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>Despite human failings, God intervenes to protect His covenant promises.

That is why I did not let you touch her.&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse stresses literal physical restraint: Abimelech had not been intimate with Sarah.<p>&#8226; God is shown as actively preserving moral boundaries, just as He later restrains wicked intent in <a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a> and <a href="/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>.<p>&#8226; Moral purity matters to the Lord; <a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;For a man&#8217;s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines all his paths.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he replied</b><p>&#8226; Abimelech answers immediately&#8212;his urgency mirrors the quick obedience of Joseph in <a href="/matthew/1-24.htm">Matthew 1:24</a> when warned in a dream.<p>&#8226; Dreams were accepted means of divine communication (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15-16</a>). Abimelech does not dismiss the message but treats it as authoritative.<p>&#8226; His reply shows genuine concern for righteousness rather than self-preservation alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lord</b><p>&#8226; The king addresses God as &#8220;Lord,&#8221; acknowledging divine supremacy much like Abram did in <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>.<p>&#8226; Although a Philistine ruler, Abimelech recognizes the true God&#8217;s authority, foreshadowing Rahab&#8217;s confession in <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>.<p>&#8226; His posture parallels the centurion&#8217;s reverence in <a href="/luke/7-6.htm">Luke 7:6-7</a>, illustrating that anyone, Jew or Gentile, can appeal to the one sovereign Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Would You destroy a nation</b><p>&#8226; Abimelech grasps that sin has corporate fallout; leaders&#8217; choices impact their people (<a href="/2_samuel/24-10.htm">2 Samuel 24:10-17</a>).<p>&#8226; He recalls recent history: Sodom and Gomorrah had just been destroyed (<a href="/bsb/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>). The memory is fresh, making God&#8217;s warning even more sobering.<p>&#8226; National accountability is a consistent biblical theme: <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4-10</a> show God weighing whole peoples according to their deeds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even though it is innocent?</b><p>&#8226; He appeals to God&#8217;s justice much like Abraham earlier: &#8220;Far be it from You to do such a thing&#8212;to kill the righteous with the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Innocent&#8221; here speaks to intention; Abimelech acted in ignorance, not rebellion (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet innocence is relative; apart from God&#8217;s intervention he would have sinned. <a href="/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a> states, &#8220;Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse highlights God&#8217;s perfect balance of justice and mercy (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a> shows a pagan king instantly recognizing God&#8217;s authority, trusting His justice, and pleading for mercy. Abimelech&#8217;s untouched state underscores God&#8217;s sovereign protection, while his concern for national consequences reminds us that sin never stays private. The passage affirms a Lord who judges rightly yet graciously warns before judgment, inviting every heart&#8212;and every nation&#8212;to stand innocent before Him through obedience and truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A righteous nation.</span>--Knobel has pointed out that there is an allusion here to the fate of Sodom. Though the malady was confined to Abimelech and his household, yet he sees destruction threatening his whole people, who, compared with the inhabitants of the Ciccar cities, were righteous. There is indirect proof: of the truth of Abimelech's assertion in the fact that death (see <a href="/genesis/20-3.htm" title="But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you are but a dead man, for the woman which you have taken; for she is a man's wife.">Genesis 20:3</a>) is acquiesced in as the fitting punishment for adultery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Abimelech had not come near her</span>. Apparently withheld by the peculiar disease which had overtaken him. The statement of the present verse (a similar one to which is not made with reference to Pharaoh) was clearly rendered necessary by the approaching birth of Isaac, who might otherwise have been said to be the child not of Abraham, but of the Philistine king. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Lord</span><span class="accented">, - Adonai</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</span> Anticipating that the stroke of Divine judgment was about to fall upon his people as well as on himself, with allusion to the fate of Sodom (Knobel), which he deprecates for his people at least on the ground that they are innocent of the offence charged against him (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>). That Abimelech and his people, like Melchisedeck and his subjects, had some knowledge of the true God, and that the Canaanites generally at this period had not reached the depth of moral degradation into which the cities of the Jordan circle had sunk before their overthrow, is apparent from the narrative. The comparative virtue, therefore, of these tribes was a proof that the hour had not arrived for the infliction on them of the doom of extermination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Abimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1429;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
