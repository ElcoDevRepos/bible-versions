The tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents a test of obedience and trust in God's wisdom. The prohibition highlights the theme of free will, as Adam and Eve are given the choice to obey or disobey. The tree itself is symbolic, representing the knowledge that belongs to God alone, and the act of eating from it signifies a desire to usurp divine authority. This command is foundational for understanding the nature of sin and the human condition, as it sets the stage for the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. Theologically, this tree contrasts with the tree of life, which symbolizes eternal life and divine provision. The presence of these trees in the Garden of Eden underscores the themes of life, death, and moral choice.<p><b>for in the day that you eat of it,</b><br>This phrase introduces the consequence of disobedience, emphasizing the immediacy and certainty of the outcome. The phrase "in the day" can be understood as a Hebraic expression indicating the certainty of the consequence rather than a literal 24-hour period. This warning serves as a divine decree, underscoring the seriousness of the command. The immediacy of the consequence highlights the gravity of sin and the breach of relationship it causes between humanity and God. This moment foreshadows the eventual fall and the introduction of sin into the world, which is a pivotal event in the biblical narrative.<p><b>you will surely die.&#8221;</b><br>The consequence of eating from the tree is death, which is both physical and spiritual. The certainty of death ("surely die") underscores the severity of disobedience and the holiness of God. This death is not immediate physical death but rather the introduction of mortality and spiritual separation from God. Theologically, this introduces the concept of original sin and the fallen state of humanity. The promise of death contrasts with the life offered by the tree of life, highlighting the choice between life and death, obedience and rebellion. This consequence sets the stage for the need for redemption, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who conquers death and offers eternal life. The theme of death and resurrection is central to Christian theology, with this verse serving as an early indication of humanity's need for a savior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who gives the command to Adam, establishing His authority and the moral order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man, created by God, who receives the command directly from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil.htm">The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></b><br>A specific tree in the Garden of Eden, symbolizing the boundary set by God for human obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The perfect dwelling place created by God for Adam and Eve, representing the ideal relationship between God and humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_command.htm">The Command</a></b><br>God's specific instruction to Adam, which serves as a test of obedience and trust in God's wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_god's_commands.htm">The Nature of God's Commands</a></b><br>God's commands are given for our protection and well-being.

Disobedience is therefore not merely breaking a rule but rejecting the sovereign Lord (compare <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>- The wording makes the prohibition personal and direct&#8212;&#8220;you&#8221; (Adam) are accountable. That same personal accountability is echoed later in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a> and <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</b><p>- Only one tree was off-limits, underscoring that God&#8217;s boundaries are clear and specific (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-16</a>).<p>- The name highlights a knowledge that belongs to God alone. Seeking it independently represents a grab for autonomy, a refusal to trust God&#8217;s definition of good and evil (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p>- Notice that nothing indicates the tree was poisonous or harmful in itself; the danger lay in disobedience. This teaches that sin is rooted in rebellion, not in created things (<a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for in the day that you eat of it</b><p>- &#8220;In the day&#8221; signals immediacy: consequences follow action, even when not fully visible at once. The pattern recurs in <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;your sin will find you out.&#8221;<p>- God combines warning with freedom; Adam is not programmed but genuinely able to choose (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>- Though the command is sobering, it is also protective&#8212;God reveals the outcome beforehand, reflecting His fatherly care (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will surely die</b><p>- The Hebrew idiom rendered &#8220;surely die&#8221; conveys certainty; there is no ambiguity about the result (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>- Spiritual death&#8212;separation from God&#8212;began immediately (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>), while physical death entered the human experience as a process culminating in <a href="/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5</a>.<p>- This sentence sets the stage for redemption: only by a substitute&#8217;s death could the penalty be met (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> lays out a clear command, a defined boundary, an immediate warning, and an unavoidable consequence. God&#8217;s prohibition is rooted in His goodness, His ownership of true moral knowledge, and His desire to protect humanity. Disobedience brings certain death&#8212;spiritually at once, physically in time&#8212;yet the verse also foreshadows the need for and promise of a Savior who will bear that death in our place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but you must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;men&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
