This moment is significant as it marks the first time Joseph sees his brothers since they sold him into slavery. Joseph's ability to recognize them highlights his keen memory and the emotional impact of their betrayal. This recognition is also a testament to God's providence, as Joseph's journey from slavery to leadership was part of a divine plan. Joseph's recognition of his brothers can be seen as a type of Christ, who recognizes and knows His own, even when they do not recognize Him.<p><b>they did not recognize him</b><br>The brothers' failure to recognize Joseph can be attributed to several factors. Joseph's appearance would have changed significantly over the years, and he was dressed in Egyptian attire, speaking through an interpreter. This lack of recognition is symbolic of spiritual blindness, a theme found throughout Scripture, where people fail to recognize God's work or presence. It also foreshadows the Jewish leaders' failure to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. The brothers' inability to recognize Joseph serves as a reminder of the transformative power of God's work in a person's life, as Joseph's journey from a Hebrew slave to an Egyptian ruler was orchestrated by God for a greater purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Once sold into slavery by his brothers, Joseph has risen to become the governor of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh.
