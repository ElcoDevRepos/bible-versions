In biblical symbolism, the rising sun often represents new beginnings or divine intervention. The timing here is crucial, as it signifies the completion of God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah, which occurs as the sun rises. The sun rising can also be seen as a metaphor for God's righteousness and justice being revealed. In the broader biblical context, light often symbolizes God's presence and truth (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>Lot had reached Zoar</b><br>Lot's arrival in Zoar is significant for several reasons. Zoar, meaning "small" or "insignificant," was one of the five cities of the plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah. It was spared from destruction at Lot's request (<a href="/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20-22</a>). This highlights God's mercy and willingness to listen to the pleas of the righteous, even when judgment is imminent. Geographically, Zoar is believed to have been located near the southeastern edge of the Dead Sea. The city's preservation serves as a testament to God's grace and the importance of obedience and faith. Lot's journey to Zoar also underscores the theme of refuge and salvation, prefiguring the ultimate refuge found in Jesus Christ, who offers salvation to those who seek Him (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, Lot is a central figure in this passage.
