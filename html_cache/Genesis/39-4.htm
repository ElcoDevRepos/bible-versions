This favor is reminiscent of the favor Noah found in God's eyes (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>) and foreshadows the favor Daniel would later find in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>). It highlights the biblical theme that God's presence can bring favor and success even in adverse situations.<p><b>and became his personal attendant.</b><br>Joseph's role as a personal attendant signifies a position of trust and responsibility. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a personal attendant would have been closely involved in the daily affairs of their master, indicating Joseph's integrity and capability. This role is a precursor to his later responsibilities in Egypt, showing a pattern of increasing responsibility and trust, similar to how David served Saul before becoming king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>).<p><b>Potiphar put him in charge of his household</b><br>Being put in charge of Potiphar's household signifies a significant elevation in status for Joseph. In Egyptian society, the household was a central unit of economic and social life, and managing it required skill and trustworthiness. This mirrors the later responsibility Joseph would have over all of Egypt under Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>), illustrating a divine preparation for his future leadership.<p><b>and entrusted him with everything he owned.</b><br>The complete trust Potiphar placed in Joseph is indicative of Joseph's exceptional character and God's blessing upon him. This total entrustment is a type of Christ, who is entrusted with all authority in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle that those who are faithful with little will be entrusted with much (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob and Rachel, Joseph is a central figure in Genesis.
