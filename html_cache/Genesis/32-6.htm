This return marks a significant moment in Jacob's life, as he is about to face the brother from whom he fled years earlier. The messengers' return signifies the beginning of a pivotal encounter. In biblical context, messengers often played crucial roles in communication, especially in times of potential conflict or reconciliation.<p><b>they said, &#8220;We went to your brother Esau</b><br>The reference to Esau as "your brother" highlights the familial bond that still exists despite past conflicts. Esau, the elder twin, had previously been wronged by Jacob, who deceived him out of his birthright and blessing. This phrase underscores the tension and unresolved issues between the two brothers. The mention of Esau also brings to mind the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> about the two nations in her womb, which foreshadows the ongoing struggle between their descendants.<p><b>and now he is coming to meet you</b><br>Esau's approach to meet Jacob could be interpreted in multiple ways. It could signify a desire for reconciliation or, conversely, an intention to confront Jacob. The ambiguity of Esau's intentions creates a sense of suspense and anxiety for Jacob. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical encounters where individuals must face their past actions and seek reconciliation, such as Joseph with his brothers in <a href="/genesis/45.htm">Genesis 45</a>.<p><b>he and four hundred men with him</b><br>The mention of four hundred men accompanying Esau suggests a formidable force, which could imply a threat. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such a number often indicated a military presence, which would naturally alarm Jacob. This detail heightens the tension and fear Jacob might feel, as he prepares to meet Esau. The number four hundred is also significant in other biblical contexts, such as the four hundred years of Israelite slavery in Egypt, symbolizing a period of trial and testing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

Their return marks the moment of truth.<p>&#8226; Jacob had obeyed God&#8217;s call to go back home (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Angels had just met him on the way (<a href="/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1&#8211;2</a>), a reminder that the Lord&#8217;s army surrounds His people even when danger looms (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The swift return of the messengers underlines the urgency of the situation; news travels fast when God is moving events toward His purposes (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p>The messengers&#8217; report will test Jacob&#8217;s faith in God&#8217;s promise, &#8220;I will surely do you good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they said</b><p>Faithful servants must tell the truth, whether the news is welcome or not (<a href="/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>). Their brief statement carries weight:<p>&#8226; No speculation&#8212;just facts.<p>&#8226; Jacob is forced to face reality, much like Israel later had to accept the spies&#8217; report (<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>).<p>&#8226; God often speaks through plain words that expose our hearts (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We went to your brother Esau</b><p>The phrase &#8220;your brother&#8221; recalls both family bond and past betrayal (<a href="/genesis/27-35.htm">Genesis 27:35&#8211;41</a>).<p>&#8226; Twenty years earlier, Jacob fled Esau&#8217;s wrath; now he must face the brother he wronged (<a href="/genesis/27-43.htm">Genesis 27:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Reconciliation is a key theme in Scripture (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>). God frequently brings us back to unresolved issues so grace can triumph over grudges.<p>&#8226; Despite the tension, calling Esau &#8220;brother&#8221; hints that the relationship can be restored (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and now he is coming to meet you</b><p>The meeting is already set in motion; Jacob cannot turn back.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Coming to meet&#8221; can signal peace, as with Joseph meeting Jacob (<a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>), or confrontation, as with Saul meeting David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence arranges encounters that shape destinies (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise given at Bethel&#8212;&#8220;I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>)&#8212;must be trusted in the face of uncertainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he and four hundred men with him</b><p>Four hundred armed men typically formed a militia (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>), naturally stirring fear.<p>&#8226; From Jacob&#8217;s view, the size of Esau&#8217;s company looks like a war party; God will soon use that fear to draw Jacob into earnest prayer (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that apparent threats often become avenues of blessing (<a href="/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Esau&#8217;s force contrasts with Jacob&#8217;s vulnerability, highlighting that deliverance comes from the Lord, not human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a> reveals a crossroads of faith: truthful messengers report that Esau approaches with 400 men. The phrase by phrase detail underscores family tension, looming danger, and God&#8217;s sovereign setup for reconciliation. Jacob must rely on the covenant promise rather than his own devices, showing that when circumstances appear threatening, the Lord is orchestrating a greater story of mercy and restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/33-1.htm">Genesis 33:1</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and four hundred men with him</span>. That Esau was attended by 400 armed followers was a proof that he had grown to be a powerful chieftain. If the hypothesis be admissible that he had already begun to live by the sword (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>), and was now invading the territory of the Horites, which he afterwards occupied (Delitzsch, Keil, Kurtz), it will serve to explain his appearance in the land of Seir, while as yet he had not finally retired from Canaan. That he came with such a formidable force to meet his brother has been set down to personal vanity, or a desire to show how powerful a prince he had become (Lyra, Menochius); to fraternal kindness, which prompted him to do honor to his brother (Peele, Calvin, Clarke), to a distinctly hostile intention (Willet, Ainsworth, Candlish), at least if circumstances should seem to call for vengeance (Keil), though it is probable that Esau's mind, on first hearing of his brother's nearness, was simply excited, and "in that wavering state which the slightest incident might soothe into good will, or rouse into vengeance" (Murphy). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/32-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the messengers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
