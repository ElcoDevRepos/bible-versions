The detailed questioning reflects Joseph's desire to learn about his family after years of separation. This interrogation is significant as it sets the stage for the eventual reconciliation. The cultural context of the time would have made such questioning seem thorough but not unusual, as travelers often needed to provide information about their origins and intentions.<p><b>&#8216;Is your father still alive?</b><br>Joseph's inquiry about their father, Jacob, indicates his deep concern and longing for his family. This question is poignant, considering Joseph's long absence and the uncertainty about his father's well-being. It also foreshadows the eventual reunion between Joseph and Jacob, which is a pivotal moment in the narrative of Genesis.<p><b>Do you have another brother?&#8217;</b><br>Joseph's question about another brother refers to Benjamin, his only full brother, as both were sons of Rachel. This inquiry is crucial because Benjamin's presence is central to Joseph's plan to test his brothers' integrity and loyalty. The mention of another brother also highlights the theme of family and brotherhood, which is prevalent throughout the book of Genesis.<p><b>And we answered him accordingly.</b><br>The brothers' response to Joseph's questions shows their honesty in this situation, contrasting with their earlier deceit when they sold Joseph into slavery. This moment is part of their character development and the broader theme of redemption and forgiveness that runs through the Joseph narrative.<p><b>How could we possibly know that he would say, &#8216;Bring your brother here&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the brothers' bewilderment and lack of foresight. It highlights the unfolding of God's providential plan, which they are unaware of. The demand to bring Benjamin to Egypt is a test orchestrated by Joseph to see if his brothers have changed since their betrayal. This situation also serves as a type of Christ, where Joseph, like Jesus, tests and ultimately forgives those who wronged him, leading to reconciliation and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is actually the brothers' sibling, though they do not recognize him.
