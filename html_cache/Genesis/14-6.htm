This area is located in the mountainous region of Edom, southeast of the Dead Sea. The Horites are often associated with cave dwellers, as the name "Horite" is believed to be derived from a word meaning "cave." This suggests a lifestyle adapted to the rugged terrain of Mount Seir. The Horites were eventually displaced by the descendants of Esau, as noted in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>. This displacement is significant in the biblical narrative, as it demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to Esau, Jacob's brother, regarding his descendants' inheritance of land.<p><b>as far as El-paran</b><br>El-paran is a location mentioned in the context of the military campaign led by Chedorlaomer and his allies. It is believed to be situated near the southern border of Canaan, possibly in the region of the Sinai Peninsula. The mention of El-paran indicates the extensive reach of the campaign, highlighting the power and influence of the invading kings. This area is also associated with the wilderness, which plays a significant role in the biblical narrative as a place of testing and revelation, as seen in the experiences of the Israelites during the Exodus.<p><b>which is near the desert</b><br>The desert, or wilderness, is a recurring theme in the Bible, often symbolizing a place of trial, purification, and divine encounter. In the context of <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>, the mention of the desert underscores the harsh and challenging environment in which these events took place. The desert is also a place where God's provision and guidance are evident, as seen in the stories of Hagar, Moses, and later, Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. The geographical reference to the desert near El-paran situates the narrative within a broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness amidst adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/horites.htm">Horites</a></b><br>An ancient people who lived in the region of Mount Seir.
