The act of emptying their sacks signifies the end of their journey and the anticipation of sharing their provisions with their family. In the broader narrative, this action sets the stage for the revelation of Joseph's continued influence over them, even from afar.<p><b>there in each man&#8217;s sack was his bag of silver!</b><br>The discovery of the silver in their sacks is a pivotal moment, symbolizing both the brothers' guilt and the mysterious workings of divine providence. The silver, which was meant to pay for the grain, being returned to them, can be seen as a test of their integrity and a reminder of their past sin against Joseph. This incident foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and redemption that will occur later in the story.<p><b>And when they and their father saw the bags of silver</b><br>The inclusion of their father, Jacob, in this scene highlights the familial tension and the weight of the brothers' actions. Jacob's reaction is crucial, as it reflects his ongoing grief and suspicion following the loss of Joseph. This moment also serves to deepen the narrative conflict, as the returned silver raises questions about the brothers' honesty and the intentions of the Egyptian ruler (Joseph).<p><b>they were dismayed.</b><br>The brothers' dismay can be attributed to their fear of being accused of theft, which would endanger their lives and their family's survival. This reaction also underscores their guilty conscience and the unresolved nature of their past betrayal of Joseph.
