The "plain" is the Jordan Valley, a fertile area that attracted Lot (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10-11</a>). Archaeological evidence suggests possible locations for these cities near the Dead Sea, with some scholars pointing to sites like Bab edh-Dhra and Numeira. The destruction serves as a historical warning against sin and a demonstration of God's justice.<p><b>He remembered Abraham</b><br>This highlights God's covenantal relationship with Abraham, emphasizing intercessory prayer's power (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>). Abraham's plea for the righteous in Sodom shows his compassion and faith. God's remembrance signifies His faithfulness to His promises, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>, <a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>). It also foreshadows Christ's intercession for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe</b><br>Lot's rescue illustrates God's mercy and grace, even when Lot chose to live among the wicked (<a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12-13</a>). The term "catastrophe" underscores the totality of the destruction, akin to the final judgment (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6-9</a>). Lot's deliverance prefigures salvation through Christ, who rescues believers from sin's consequences (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p><b>that destroyed the cities where he had lived</b><br>This reiterates the complete annihilation of Sodom and Gomorrah, serving as a testament to God's judgment against sin (<a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>). Lot's choice to live there despite its reputation reflects the tension between worldly allure and righteous living.

God literally rained down fire and sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), fulfilling the warning voiced in <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>.<p>&#8226; These cities had become &#8220;exceedingly wicked and sinful against the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament writers look back to this event as a preview of final judgment (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>; Jude 7; <a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28-30</a>).<p>The destruction is a sober reminder that God&#8217;s holiness cannot overlook persistent, unrepentant sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He remembered Abraham</b><p>&#8220;Remembered&#8221; is covenant language; it signals that God actively keeps His promises and responds to the prayers of His people (compare <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-45.htm">Psalm 106:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Abraham had interceded fervently for the righteous in Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s mindfulness of Abraham underscores the power of intercessory prayer: one man&#8217;s plea can alter another man&#8217;s destiny.<p>&#8226; It also spotlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant friend (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe</b><p>Lot is rescued because of Abraham&#8217;s intercession and God&#8217;s mercy, not because of Lot&#8217;s spiritual strength (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The angels practically dragged him out, illustrating that salvation is an act of divine grace reaching into human weakness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7-9</a> confirms that God &#8220;rescued righteous Lot&#8221; and knows how &#8220;to rescue the godly from trials.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: while the cities burn, Lot is spared, highlighting the biblical theme of deliverance amid judgment (<a href="/bsb/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>; <a href="/bsb/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that destroyed the cities where he had lived.</b><p>The final clause circles back to the total ruin of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Lot had pitched his tents near Sodom years earlier (<a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a>) and eventually settled inside.

The same holy God who justly destroys sin-soaked cities also lovingly honors a believer&#8217;s prayer and rescues the undeserving. The verse calls us to take sin seriously, intercede for others fervently, and trust that God faithfully remembers His promises even in the midst of judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> - not a pluperfect (Rosenm&uuml;ller), as if a direct continuation of the preceding narrative, but a preterit, being the commencement of a new subdivision of the history in which the writer treats of Lot's residence in Zoar - <span class="cmt_word">when God</span> - Elohim. Hence, as a fragment of the original Elohist's composition, the present verse is by the pseudo-criticism connected with <a href="/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a> (Ilgen, Tuch, Block); but "a greater abruptness of style and a more fragmentary mode of composition" than this would indicate "could not easily be imagined" (Kalisch). The change in the Divine name is sufficiently explained by the supposition that the destruction of the cities of the plain was not at the moment viewed by the writer in its connection with the Abrahamic covenant and intercession, but as a sublime vindication of Divine justice (cf. Quarry, p. 444) - <span class="cmt_word">destroyed</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">he destroying, by Elohim</span>, or in Elohim s destroying) <span class="cmt_word">the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham.</span> If the narrative containing the intercession of Abraham and the overthrow of Sodom was due to the Jehovist, how came the earlier author to know anything about those events? The obvious allusions to them in the present verse could only have been made by one acquainted with them. Either, therefore, the present verse proceeded from the hand of the so-called Jehovist, or it requires explanation how in the original document this should be the first and only occasion on which they are referred to (cf.
