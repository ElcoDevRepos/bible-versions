Egypt, known for its fertile Nile Delta, was a common refuge during famines. The Egyptians, as a powerful and advanced civilization, were known for their distinct social and cultural practices. Abram anticipates the reaction of the Egyptians upon seeing Sarai, who is described as beautiful. This reflects the historical context where beauty could lead to political and social complications.<p><b>they will say, &#8216;This is his wife.&#8217;</b><br>Abram predicts that the Egyptians will recognize Sarai as his wife. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, marriage was a significant social institution, and a wife was often seen as a valuable asset. The recognition of Sarai as Abram's wife implies a potential threat to Abram, as her beauty could attract the attention of powerful men, possibly leading to conflict or harm.<p><b>Then they will kill me</b><br>Abram fears for his life, believing that the Egyptians might kill him to take Sarai. This reflects the harsh realities of ancient societies where power struggles and the desire for beautiful women could lead to violence. Abram's fear also highlights his lack of trust in God's protection at this moment, despite God's earlier promises to bless him and make him a great nation.<p><b>but will let you live.</b><br>Abram assumes that Sarai will be spared because of her beauty and potential value to the Egyptians. This assumption underscores the vulnerability of women in ancient times, who could be seen as commodities in political and social transactions. It also sets the stage for God's intervention, as seen later in the narrative, where God protects Sarai and Abram despite their deception. This situation foreshadows the recurring biblical theme of God's faithfulness and protection over His chosen people, even when they falter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is later renamed Abraham by God. He is a man of faith, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.

He anticipates immediate attention from Egyptians who, like many ancient peoples, quickly assessed travelers.<p>&#8226; The statement shows Abram&#8217;s consciousness of Sarai&#8217;s striking beauty (<a href="/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14</a>) and the reality that in a pagan nation rulers often seized what they desired (cf. <a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>; <a href="/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Abram&#8217;s foresight here is factual, not speculative; later events confirm that the Egyptians did notice her (<a href="/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will say, &#8216;This is his wife.&#8217;</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they will say, &#8216;This is his wife.&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-12.htm">Genesis 12:12</a>)<p>&#8226; Abram expects officials to discover their marital bond, which would normally protect Sarai but place him in danger.<p>&#8226; In lands where kings and pharaohs took women into harems, husbands were expendable (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/genesis/20-11.htm">Genesis 20:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Abram&#8217;s concern underscores the fallen tendency of governments to abuse power when God&#8217;s moral standards are ignored (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they will kill me</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Then they will kill me&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-12.htm">Genesis 12:12</a>)<p>&#8226; Abram calculates that eliminating the husband would be the simplest path for Pharaoh to claim Sarai.<p>&#8226; Fear replaces faith here; Abram momentarily loses sight of the Lord&#8217;s promise to protect and bless him (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns that fear of man brings a snare (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>), yet God&#8217;s covenant purposes endure despite human weakness (<a href="/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But will let you live</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but will let you live.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-12.htm">Genesis 12:12</a>)<p>&#8226; Sarai&#8217;s life would be spared because she would be absorbed into Pharaoh&#8217;s household (<a href="/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast&#8212;death for Abram, life for Sarai under pagan control&#8212;highlights the peril of a half-truth strategy. Similar scenes repeat with Isaac and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a>) and later with Esther, though in each case God preserves His people (<a href="/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty ultimately overrides human schemes; He intervenes through plagues on Pharaoh&#8217;s house (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>), ensuring both Abram&#8217;s and Sarai&#8217;s deliverance and safeguarding the messianic line (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/12-12.htm">Genesis 12:12</a> records Abram&#8217;s candid appraisal of what would likely happen in Egypt: officials would notice Sarai&#8217;s beauty, identify her as his wife, kill him to remove competition, and spare her for Pharaoh. The verse exposes Abram&#8217;s fear-driven plan, yet also sets the stage for God&#8217;s faithful intervention. Even when believers falter, the Lord upholds His covenant promises, directs history toward redemption, and turns human weakness into occasions to display His protective grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/12-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
