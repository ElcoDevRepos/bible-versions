In the ancient Near East, childbirth was a perilous event, often resulting in the death of the mother or child. Rachel's labor is described as severe, indicating the intensity and danger of the situation. This moment is significant as it fulfills the promise of God to Jacob regarding his descendants. The severity of the labor also highlights the theme of struggle and suffering that often precedes blessing in biblical narratives.<p><b>the midwife said to her</b><br>Midwives played a crucial role in ancient societies, assisting women during childbirth. Their presence indicates the seriousness of Rachel's condition, as midwives were skilled in handling complications. The midwife's role here is not only practical but also comforting, as she provides reassurance to Rachel. This reflects the communal and supportive nature of childbirth in ancient times, contrasting with the isolation often experienced in modern contexts.<p><b>&#8220;Do not be afraid</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical exhortation, often used by God or His messengers to reassure individuals facing fear or uncertainty. It reflects the divine presence and assurance in times of distress. In this context, the midwife's words echo God's promises and faithfulness, encouraging Rachel to trust in the outcome despite her current suffering. This phrase connects to other biblical instances where fear is overcome by faith, such as in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>.<p><b>for you are having another son.&#8221;</b><br>The announcement of a son is significant in the patriarchal society of the Bible, where sons were seen as carriers of the family name and inheritance. This birth fulfills God's promise to Jacob of numerous descendants. The birth of Benjamin, Rachel's second son, is pivotal in the narrative of Israel's tribes. Benjamin's birth also foreshadows the future tribe of Benjamin, which plays a crucial role in Israel's history. The mention of "another son" ties back to Rachel's earlier desire for children, as seen in <a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>, and highlights the continuation of God's covenant promises through Jacob's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who is experiencing severe labor.

Rachel&#8217;s pains are &#8220;severe,&#8221; reminding us that the sorrow of childbirth spoken of in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a> is a real, bodily consequence of the fall.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently acknowledges the intensity of labor (<a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>), yet never treats it as purposeless; God brings life through pain.<p>&#8226; The detail sets a sober scene: Rachel&#8217;s struggle is genuine, underscoring that the events that follow are anchored in literal history, not allegory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The midwife said to her</b><p>&#8226; Midwives in Scripture appear as compassionate helpers (<a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15-17</a>) and as messengers of pivotal news (<a href="/1_samuel/4-20.htm">1 Samuel 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Here the midwife sees Rachel weakening and steps in with words meant to steady her spirit&#8212;an act of practical mercy echoing <a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>.<p>&#8226; Her involvement also shows God&#8217;s providence working through ordinary people; He uses human voices to bring His comfort at critical moments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not be afraid</b><p>&#8226; Fear is natural in a life-threatening delivery, yet God&#8217;s people are constantly urged to let faith eclipse fear (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The command reassures Rachel that the Lord who opened her womb before (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22-24</a>) is still present.<p>&#8226; Similar words appear when heaven announces life-changing births&#8212;&#8220;Do not be afraid&#8221; to Zechariah, Mary, and the shepherds (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 30</a>; 2:10)&#8212;indicating that God&#8217;s consolations remain the same through every generation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For you are having another son</b><p>&#8226; The promise of &#8220;another son&#8221; ties directly to God&#8217;s covenant blessing of fruitfulness to Abraham&#8217;s line (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; 17:6).<p>&#8226; It points beyond the moment: Benjamin will complete the twelve sons, the heads of Israel&#8217;s tribes, showing God&#8217;s plan unfolding exactly.<p>&#8226; Rachel, who once cried &#8220;Give me children, or I will die!&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>), now receives a second son even as her life ebbs&#8212;evidence that God keeps His word even when circumstances look bleak (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The announcement also hints at hope and legacy; though Rachel will soon pass (<a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>), her son will carry forward her name and the promises attached to Jacob&#8217;s family line (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/35-17.htm">Genesis 35:17</a> captures a razor-sharp moment where pain, fear, and promise collide. Rachel&#8217;s intense labor shows the cost of life in a fallen world, yet God&#8217;s providence shines through a caring midwife&#8217;s voice. The call to cast out fear points Rachel&#8212;and us&#8212;to trust the Lord amid mortal danger. Finally, the assurance of &#8220;another son&#8221; signals God&#8217;s unstoppable covenant purposes: even through suffering and death, He fulfills His promises and builds the house of Israel exactly as He said He would.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in her laboring hard in her parturition</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>that the midwife said unto her, Fear not;
