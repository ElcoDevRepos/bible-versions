This action reflects his leadership and responsibility as the head of his family. In the patriarchal society of the time, it was customary for the husband to make significant decisions, and Jacob's initiative here is consistent with that cultural norm. This phrase also highlights the importance of communication within a family unit, a principle that is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>, where husbands are instructed to love and lead their wives.<p><b>and called Rachel and Leah</b><br>By calling both Rachel and Leah, Jacob demonstrates fairness and inclusivity, ensuring that both of his wives are informed and involved in the decision-making process. This action is significant given the rivalry between the sisters, as seen in previous chapters. It underscores the importance of unity and cooperation within a family, a theme that is prevalent in biblical teachings, such as in <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>, which speaks of the blessings of dwelling together in unity.<p><b>to the field</b><br>The field represents a place of work and provision, as Jacob's flocks were his livelihood. This setting is significant because it is away from the prying eyes of Laban and his household, providing a private space for Jacob to discuss his plans with Rachel and Leah. The field as a setting for divine encounters and revelations is a recurring motif in the Bible, as seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 2) and the shepherds receiving the announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8-14</a>).<p><b>where his flocks were</b><br>Jacob's flocks symbolize God's provision and blessing, as they were a result of the divine promise and Jacob's diligent work. The mention of the flocks also serves as a reminder of Jacob's prosperity despite Laban's attempts to deceive him. This prosperity is a fulfillment of God's promise to Jacob in <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>, where God assured him of His presence and blessing. The flocks can also be seen as a type of Christ, the Good Shepherd, who cares for His sheep, as described in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and husband to both Leah and Rachel.

The field was probably the pasture where Laban's flocks fed, as they were specially under Jacob's charge; and there, in the open ground, the three would run no risk of having their conversation overheard. Jacob's speech to his wives consists of three parts: first, he tells them of the change in Laban's manner towards him, and his consequent fear of violence; he next justifies his own conduct towards their father, and accuses him of repeated injustice; finally, he announces to them that he had received the Divine command to return to Canaan. As regards the second point, Jacob had undoubtedly used stratagems to increase his wages, and of this his wives must have been well aware. On the other hand, we learn that Laban had openly violated the terms of the bargain; and, whereas all the parti-coloured kids and lambs were to belong to Jacob, no sooner did they increase beyond expectation, than Laban, first, would give him only the speckled, the most common kind, and finally, only the ring-straked, which were the most rare. Of course Jacob would keep all the sheep and goats which he had once made over to the charge of his sons; it would be the additions to them from Laban's flocks which were thus diminished.<p>As regards the vision, it has been thought that Jacob has compressed two occurrences into one narrative; but for insufficient reasons. It was at the breeding-time (<a href="/genesis/31-10.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped on the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.">Genesis 31:10</a>) that Jacob saw the vision, with its two-fold lesson: the first, that the multiplication of his wages had been God's gift, and not the result of his own artifices; the second, that this bestowal of wealth was to enable him to return to Canaan. His wives heartily concurred in his purpose, but it was not till the time of sheep-shearing came (<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>) that he effected his escape. But there is no difficulty in this delay. How large the household of Jacob had become we learn from the greatness of the present he selected for Esau (<a href="/context/genesis/32-13.htm" title="And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;">Genesis 32:13-15</a>), and it could not be removed without preparation. The servants and camels must be gathered in from their trading expeditions, tents must be got ready, and camels' furniture and other requisites obtained; finally, they could not start until the ewes were fit for their journey, and only at a time of year when there would be herbage for the cattle on the march. We find that when they reached the Jabbok, Jacob's flocks and herds were "giving suck" (<a href="/genesis/33-13.htm" title="And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.">Genesis 33:13</a> in the Heb.); but it is not easy to calculate the interval between this and the time when they commenced their journey.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob went</span> - being unwilling to approach the house lest Laban should discover his design (Rosenm&uuml;ller) - <span class="cmt_word">and called Rachel and Leah</span> - Rachel may be placed first as the beloved wife of Jacob (Wordsworth, Lange), scarcely as the principal wife in comparison with Leah, who was <span class="accented">adventitia</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller;
