Joseph, once sold into slavery by his brothers, has risen to a position of power as the governor of Egypt. His home would have been a place of significant status, reflecting his high rank. This moment is pivotal as it sets the stage for the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), where his brothers would bow to him.<p><b>they presented him with the gifts they had brought</b><br>The brothers bring gifts to Joseph as a gesture of goodwill and respect, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern culture when approaching a person of higher status. These gifts were likely chosen to appease Joseph and secure favor, reflecting the customs of diplomacy and reconciliation. The act of presenting gifts is reminiscent of Jacob's earlier attempt to appease Esau with gifts (<a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-21</a>).<p><b>and they bowed to the ground before him</b><br>This act of bowing fulfills the prophecy of Joseph's dreams, where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his sheaf (<a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7</a>). Bowing was a sign of deep respect and submission, acknowledging Joseph's authority. This moment is significant in the narrative, as it demonstrates the sovereignty of God's plan and the fulfillment of His promises. It also prefigures the ultimate submission to Christ, who is typified by Joseph as a savior figure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
