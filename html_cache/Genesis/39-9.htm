This statement reflects the trust and responsibility given to him, highlighting his integrity and capability. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a slave achieving such status was unusual, indicating God's favor and Joseph's exceptional character. This mirrors the biblical theme of God exalting the humble, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Daniel.<p><b>He has withheld nothing from me except you,</b><br>Joseph acknowledges the complete trust Potiphar has placed in him, except for Potiphar's wife. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where a wife was considered the exclusive possession of her husband. The phrase underscores the boundaries of trust and the sanctity of marriage, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing fidelity and respect for marital bonds.<p><b>because you are his wife.</b><br>This phrase highlights the covenantal nature of marriage, which is a sacred institution established by God. Joseph's recognition of Potiphar's wife as off-limits underscores the biblical principle of honoring marriage vows. This respect for marriage is echoed in the Ten Commandments, specifically the commandment against adultery, and is further reinforced by Jesus in the New Testament.<p><b>So how could I do such a great evil</b><br>Joseph's moral reasoning is evident here, as he identifies the act of adultery as a "great evil." This reflects the biblical understanding of sin as an offense against God's moral order. The gravity of the sin is emphasized, showing Joseph's awareness of the ethical implications of his actions. This aligns with the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, which warns against the destructive nature of adultery.<p><b>and sin against God?&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's ultimate concern is not just the betrayal of Potiphar's trust but the sin against God. This demonstrates his deep relationship with God and understanding that all sin is ultimately against the Creator. This perspective is consistent with King David's confession in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, where he acknowledges his sin against God. Joseph's stance foreshadows the New Testament teaching that believers are to live in a way that honors God, reflecting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, serving in the house of Potiphar.

By framing the conversation this way, he sets the stage for why betrayal would be unthinkable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife</b><p>Joseph clarifies boundaries: &#8220;He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Stewardship requires respecting limits. <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> established marriage as a sacred union that no outsider may violate.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a> (&#8220;You shall not commit adultery&#8221;) underscores that this boundary is non-negotiable.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a> affirms that marital intimacy belongs only to husband and wife.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/16-12.htm">Luke 16:12</a> challenges us: if we cannot be faithful with what belongs to another, how will God entrust us with true riches?<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a> reminds us that God withholds &#8220;no good thing&#8221; from the upright; therefore, anything God forbids is ultimately harmful.<p>Joseph&#8217;s words show respect for Potiphar&#8217;s marriage and highlight that faithful stewardship means honoring every line God and legitimate authority have drawn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?</b><p>Joseph&#8217;s final appeal shifts the focus upward: &#8220;So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?&#8221;.<p>&#8226; While the act would wrong Potiphar, Joseph names it primarily a sin against God. <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a> echoes this God-ward focus: &#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The fear of the Lord is &#8220;the beginning of knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>); Joseph&#8217;s reverence steers his choices.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a> shows David confessing adultery as sin against the Lord&#8212;reinforcing that all moral violations are ultimately offenses against Him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-4</a> teaches that God&#8217;s will is our sanctification, specifically avoiding sexual immorality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13-15</a> warns that temptation, if embraced, gives birth to sin; Joseph cuts it off before it conceives.<p>Joseph&#8217;s question is rhetorical: he cannot fathom betraying the God who orchestrated his rise and whose presence (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a>) defines his life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a> captures Joseph&#8217;s heart of integrity.
