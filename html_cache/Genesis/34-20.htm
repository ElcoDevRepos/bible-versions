Hamor is the Hivite ruler of the region, and Shechem is his son, who has committed a grievous act against Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. This father-son duo represents the leadership and authority in their community, which is significant in understanding the dynamics of the events that unfold. The Hivites were one of the Canaanite tribes, and their interactions with the Israelites often involved conflict and moral challenges.<p><b>went to the gate of their city</b><br>The city gate was a place of significant social and legal activity in ancient Near Eastern culture. It served as a hub for community gatherings, legal transactions, and public announcements. By going to the gate, Hamor and Shechem are engaging with the city's leaders and elders, seeking their approval and support for the proposal they are about to make. This setting underscores the importance of the decision and the need for communal consent.<p><b>and addressed the men of their city:</b><br>Addressing the men of the city indicates a formal and public discourse. In patriarchal societies, men held positions of authority and decision-making power. The act of addressing them suggests that Hamor and Shechem are seeking to persuade the city's leaders to agree to a covenant with Jacob's family. This moment is pivotal, as it involves negotiation and the potential for intermarriage, which carries significant implications for the future relations between the Israelites and the Canaanites. The narrative highlights themes of justice, retribution, and the complexities of cultural integration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince.

Their united appearance underscores a calculated family alliance, intent on turning sin into social contract. Like Ahab and Jezebel maneuvering for Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1&#8211;16</a>), father and son present a single front, hoping position and persuasion will override righteousness. Note the ironic contrast with Abraham and Isaac&#8217;s earlier father-son obedience (<a href="/genesis/22-7.htm">Genesis 22:7-8</a>). Where Abraham led his son up a mountain in faith, Hamor leads his son to a city meeting in deceit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went to the gate of their city</b><p>The city gate functioned as courthouse, council chamber, and marketplace (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). Business transactions, civic rulings, and covenant agreements happened there in full view. By choosing this venue, Hamor and Shechem seek legitimacy for an immoral proposal, just as Absalom stood at the gate to steal Israel&#8217;s loyalty (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2&#8211;6</a>). The gate reminds us that public approval never sanctifies private sin; crowds can applaud what God condemns (<a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and addressed the men of their city</b><p>The speech to &#8220;the men&#8221; reveals motive: enlist the whole community so every male agrees to circumcision, removing any resistance (<a href="/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21-23</a>). They frame the deal as economic gain&#8212;&#8220;Their livestock and their property will become ours&#8221;&#8212;echoing the greed-tinged unity at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>). The pattern repeats: fleshly desire cloaked in communal benefit. Compare Jezebel&#8217;s use of false witnesses to justify Naboth&#8217;s death (<a href="/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9-10</a>) or Demetrius rallying craftsmen against Paul for profit&#8217;s sake (<a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24-27</a>). The men listen, but their consent positions them for judgment when Simeon and Levi strike (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25-29</a>). Agreement with unrighteousness invites disaster (<a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-19</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a> shows a father and son exploiting civic structures to legitimize sin. The gate&#8217;s authority, the united front, and the persuasive speech illustrate how wickedness often seeks communal endorsement. Scripture warns that public consensus cannot shield rebellion from divine justice, urging believers to discern truth over majority, righteousness over profit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hamor and Shechem his son came</span> (or went) <span class="cmt_word">unto the gate of their city</span> (vide on Genesis 19:2; 23:10), <span class="cmt_word">and communed with</span> (or spake to) <span class="cmt_word">the men of their city, saying, These men</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jacob and his sons) <span class="cmt_word">are peaceable with us</span> (literally, <span class="accented">peaceable are they with us</span>.
