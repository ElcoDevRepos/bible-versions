Their involvement in selling Joseph highlights the ancient trade routes connecting Canaan and Egypt. This act of selling Joseph into slavery fulfills the earlier dreams Joseph had, setting the stage for his rise in Egypt. The sale of Joseph by the Midianites also foreshadows the betrayal and sale of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, drawing a typological parallel between Joseph and Christ.<p><b>to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh</b><br>Potiphar is identified as an officer of Pharaoh, indicating his high status in Egyptian society. The name Potiphar means "he whom Ra has given," reflecting the Egyptian practice of naming individuals in honor of their gods. Potiphar's position as an officer suggests he was part of the royal court, which would have been a place of significant political and social influence. This connection to Pharaoh's court is crucial for the unfolding of God's plan, as it places Joseph in a position where he can eventually save his family and many others from famine.<p><b>and captain of the guard.</b><br>As captain of the guard, Potiphar held a significant military and security role, likely overseeing the protection of Pharaoh and the royal household. This position would have required trustworthiness and competence, indicating that Joseph was sold into a household of considerable power and responsibility. The role of captain of the guard also implies that Potiphar had authority over the prison where Joseph would later be held, setting the stage for Joseph's interactions with Pharaoh's officials. This aspect of the narrative underscores God's providence in placing Joseph in circumstances that would lead to the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers.
