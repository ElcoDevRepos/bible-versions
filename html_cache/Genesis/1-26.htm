In the creation narrative, God's speech is the mechanism through which creation occurs, highlighting His sovereignty. This aligns with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where the Word is identified with God and is active in creation.<p><b>&#8220;Let Us make man in Our image,</b><br>The plural pronoun "Us" has been interpreted in various ways, including as a reference to the Trinity, suggesting a complex unity within the Godhead. This is consistent with the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, where God is one in essence but three in persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The concept of being made in God's image implies a unique relationship between humanity and God, setting humans apart from the rest of creation.<p><b>after Our likeness,</b><br>"Likeness" reinforces the idea of resemblance to God, not in physical form but in attributes such as rationality, morality, and the capacity for relationship. This likeness is foundational for understanding human dignity and worth. It also points to the potential for humans to reflect God's character, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>, which speaks of putting on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.<p><b>to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air,</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of dominion, where humans are given authority over other forms of life. This stewardship role is a mandate to care for and manage creation responsibly. <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6-8</a> echoes this theme, celebrating humanity's God-given authority over creation.<p><b>over the livestock,</b><br>The mention of livestock indicates the inclusion of domesticated animals, which were integral to ancient Near Eastern life for agriculture, transportation, and sustenance. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where animals were vital to survival and economic stability.<p><b>and over all the earth itself</b><br>This broadens the scope of human dominion to include the entire earth, suggesting a comprehensive stewardship role. It implies responsibility for the environment and natural resources, aligning with the biblical theme of creation care.<p><b>and every creature that crawls upon it.&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase encompasses all terrestrial life, emphasizing the extent of human authority. It underscores the comprehensive nature of the dominion mandate, which includes all living creatures. This stewardship is a recurring biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks and initiates the creation of mankind.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>Refers to humanity, created in the image and likeness of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event of God creating the world and everything in it, culminating in the creation of mankind.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fish,_birds,_livestock,_earth,_creatures.htm">Fish, Birds, Livestock, Earth, Creatures</a></b><br>The various elements of creation over which humanity is given dominion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_image_of_god.htm">The Image of God</a></b><br>Humanity is uniquely created in the image and likeness of God, which imparts inherent dignity and value to every person.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_purpose_and_responsibility.htm">Divine Purpose and Responsibility</a></b><br>Being made in God's image comes with the responsibility to steward and care for creation, reflecting God's character in our actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_relationship.htm">Community and Relationship</a></b><br>The plural language "Let Us make" hints at the relational nature of God, encouraging us to value community and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_and_ethical_living.htm">Moral and Ethical Living</a></b><br>Recognizing the image of God in ourselves and others should guide our moral and ethical decisions, promoting respect and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/renewal_and_transformation.htm">Renewal and Transformation</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be renewed in the image of Christ, growing in holiness and reflecting God's character more fully.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_1_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 1:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_26_Humanity_s_role.htm">How does Genesis 1:26 define humanity's role in God's creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_in_Our_image_reveal.htm">What does "in Our image" reveal about human nature and dignity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_26_and_the_Trinity_link.htm">How does Genesis 1:26 connect to the concept of the Trinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_dominion_affect_eco-stewardship.htm">How should "rule over...all the earth" influence Christian environmental stewardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Reflect_God_s_image_daily.htm">How can we reflect God's image in our daily interactions with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Our_image_suggest_about_God.htm">What does "Let Us make man in Our image" imply about the nature of God in Genesis 1:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_26_and_the_Trinity_link_2.htm">How does Genesis 1:26 support the concept of the Trinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_plural_pronouns_in_Genesis_1_26.htm">Why does Genesis 1:26 use plural pronouns for God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_aliens_and_ufos_real.htm">Are aliens and UFOs real?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_ai.htm">What does the Bible say about artificial intelligence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_body_modification.htm">What does the Bible say about body modification?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_eating_disorders.htm">What does the Bible say about eating disorders?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Genesis 1:26 Mean</div><b>Then God said</b><p>&#8226;

The making of man is so ushered in as to show that at length the work of creation had reached its perfection and ultimate goal.

But it is denied in <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm" title="Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counselor has taught him?">Isaiah 40:13</a> that God ever took counsel with any one but Himself. The Jewish interpreters generally think that the angels are meant.

And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.">Genesis 1:2</a> was the pregnant germ which grew into the revelation of the Holy Ghost, so in Elohim, the many powers concentrated in one being, lies the germ of the doctrine of a plurality of persons in the Divine Unity. It is not a formal proof of the Trinity, nor do believers in the inspiration of Holy Scripture so use it. What they affirm is, that from the very beginning the Bible is full of such germs, and that no one of them remains barren, but all develop, and become Christian truths. There is in this first book a vast array of figures, types, indications, yearnings, hopes, fears, promises, and express predictions, which advance onwards like an ever-deepening river, and when they all find a logical fulfilment in one way, the conclusion is that that fulfilment is not only true, but was intended.<p><span class= "bld">Man.</span>--Hebrew, <span class= "ital">Adam. </span>In Assyrian the name for man is also <span class= "ital">adamu, </span>or <span class= "ital">admu. </span>In that literature, so marvellously preserved to our days, Sir H. Rawlinson thinks that he has traced the first man up to the black or Accadian race. It is hopeless to attempt any derivation of the name, as it must have existed before any of the verbs and nouns from which commentators attempt to give it a meaning; and the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>or "tilled ground," of which we shall soon hear so much, evidently had its name from Adam.<p><span class= "bld">In our image, after our likeness.</span>--The human body is after God's image only as being the means whereby man attains to dominion: for dominion is God's attribute, inasmuch as He is sole Lord. Man's body, therefore, as that of one who rules, is erect, and endowed with speech, that he may give the word of command. The soul is first, in God's <span class= "ital">image. </span>This, as suggesting an external likeness, may refer to man's reason, free-will, self-consciousness, and so on. But it is, secondly, in God's <span class= "ital">likeness, </span>which implies something closer and more inward. It refers to man's moral powers, and especially to his capacity of attaining unto holiness. Now man has lost neither of these two. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.">James 3:9</a>.) Both were weakened and defiled by the fall, but were still retained in a greater or less degree. In the man Christ Jesus both were perfect; and fallen man, when new-created in Christ, attains actually to that perfection which was his only potentially at his first creation, and to which Adam never did attain. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The importance assigned in the Biblical record to the creation of man is indicated by the manner in which it is introduced. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let us make man.</span> Having already explained the significance of the term <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, as suggesting the fullness of the Divine personality, and foreshadowing the doctrine of the Trinity (ver. 1), other interpretations, such as that God takes counsel with the angels (Philo, Aben Ezra, Delitzsch), or with the earth (Maimonides, M. Gerumlius), or with himself (Kalisch), must be set aside in favor of that which detects in the peculiar phraseology an allusion to a sublime <span class="accented">concilium</span> among the persons of the Godhead (Calvin, Macdonald, Murphy). The object which this <span class="accented">concilium</span> contemplated was the construction of a new creature to be named <span class="accented">Adam</span>; descriptive of either his <span class="accented">color</span>, from <span class="accented">adam</span>, to be red, (Josephus, Gesenius, Tuch, Hupfeld); or his <span class="accented">appearance</span>, from a root in Arabic which signifies "to shine," thus making Adam "the brilliant one;" or his <span class="accented">compactness</span>, both as an individual and as a race, from another Arabic root which means "to bring or hold together" (Meier, Furst); or his <span class="accented">nature as</span> God's image, from <span class="accented">dam</span>, likeness (Eichorn, Richers); or, and most probably, his <span class="accented">origin</span>, from <span class="accented">adamah</span>, the ground (Kimchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">In our image, after our likeness</span>. The precise relationship in which the nature of the <span class="accented">Adam</span> about to be produced should stand to <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was to be that of a <span class="accented">tselem</span> (shadow - vid. <a href="/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) and a <span class="accented">damuth</span> (likeness, from <span class="accented">damah</span>, to bring together, to compare - <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). As nearly as possible the terms are synonymous. If any distinction does exist between them, perhaps <span class="accented">tselem</span> (image) denotes the shadow outline of a figure, and <span class="accented">damuth</span> (likeness) the correspondence or resemblance of that shadow to the figure. The early Fathers were of opinion that the words were expressive of separate ideas: <span class="accented">image</span>, of the body, which by reason of its beauty, intelligent aspect, and erect stature was an adumbration of God; <span class="accented">likeness</span>, of the soul, or the intellectual and moral nature. According to Augustine <span class="accented">image</span> had reference to the <span class="accented">cognitio veritatis</span>; <span class="accented">likeness</span> to <span class="accented">amor virtutis</span>. Irenaeus, Clement, and Origen saw in the first man nature as originally created, and in the second what that nature might become through personal ethical conflict, or through the influence of grace. Bellarmine thought "imaginem in natura, similitudinem in probitate et justitia sitam esse," and conceived that "Adamum peccando non imaginem Dei, sed similitudinero perdidisse." Havernick suggests that image is the concrete, and <span class="accented">likeness</span> the abstract designation of the idea. Modern expositors generally discover no distinction whatever between the words; in this respect following Luther, who renders <span class="accented">an image that is like</span>, and Calvin, who denies that any difference exists between the two. As to what in man constituted the <span class="accented">imago Dei</span>, the reformed theologians commonly held it to have consisted <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the spirituality of his being, as an intelligent and free agent; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the moral integrity and holiness of his nature; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his dominion over the creatures (cf. West. Conf., <a href="/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a>).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
