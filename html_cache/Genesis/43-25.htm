In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and peace. This meal foreshadows reconciliation and the breaking down of barriers between Joseph and his brothers. The act of eating together is a precursor to the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity and the restoration of familial bonds. This setting also reflects the customs of hospitality and honor in Egyptian society, where meals were often used to establish or reinforce social and political relationships.<p><b>they prepared their gift for Joseph&#8217;s arrival at noon</b><br>The preparation of a gift signifies respect and an attempt to gain favor, a common practice in ancient times when approaching someone of higher status. The brothers' gift, consisting of balm, honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds, reflects the agricultural products of Canaan and the trade practices of the time. Noon, the time of Joseph's expected arrival, was a customary time for meals in Egypt, aligning with the daily rhythms of life in the region. This act of preparation also highlights the brothers' anxiety and desire to appease Joseph, whom they still perceive as a powerful Egyptian official. The gift can be seen as a peace offering, reminiscent of Jacob's earlier gifts to Esau, symbolizing attempts at reconciliation and the mending of broken relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who had previously sold Joseph into slavery.
