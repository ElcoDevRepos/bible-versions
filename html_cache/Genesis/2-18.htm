The use of "LORD God" combines the covenant name Yahweh with Elohim, underscoring both His personal and powerful nature.<p><b>It is not good for the man to be alone.</b><br>This statement marks the first time in the creation narrative that something is described as "not good," contrasting with the repeated declarations of goodness in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>.

This phrase sets the stage for the creation of woman, emphasizing the necessity of companionship and partnership in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>I will make for him a suitable helper.</b><br>The term "helper" (Hebrew: ezer) does not imply inferiority but rather denotes a complementary partner. In other biblical contexts, "ezer" is used to describe God as a helper to Israel, indicating strength and support. The word "suitable" (Hebrew: kenegdo) suggests a counterpart who corresponds to the man, highlighting equality and mutuality.

In the preliminary creation record (7-27) it is simply stated that God created man, male and female; there is a complete absence of details as to the Divine <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> in the execution of these, his last and greatest works. It is one object, among others, of the second portion of the history to supply those details. With regard to man (Adam), an account of his formation, at once minute and exhaustive, has been given in the preceding verses (7-17); now, with like attention to antecedent and concomitant circumstances and events, the sacred penman adds a description of the time, reason, manner, and result of the formation of woman. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be alone.</span> While the animals were produced either in swarms (as the fishes) or in pairs (as the birds and beasts), man was created as an individual; his partner, by a subsequent operation of creative power, being produced from himself.

Neither is it needful to wonder how God should pronounce that to be not good which he had previously (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>) affirmed was good. The Divine judgment of which the preceding chapter speaks was expressed at the completion of man's creation; this, while that creation was in progress. For the new-made man to have been left without a partner would, in the estimation of Jehovah Elohim, have been for him a condition of being which, if not necessarily bad in itself, yet, considering his intellectual and social nature, "would eventually have passed over from the negative not good, or a manifest want, into the positive not good, or a hurtful impropriety"' (Lange).
