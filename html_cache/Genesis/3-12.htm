It highlights the immediate shift in human behavior post-fall, where Adam, instead of taking responsibility, begins to deflect blame. This moment marks the beginning of human tendency to avoid accountability, a theme that recurs throughout Scripture.<p><b>The woman whom You gave me,</b><br>Adam's words here reflect a dual blame: on Eve and indirectly on God. By saying "whom You gave me," Adam implies that God is partly responsible for his disobedience. This reflects a broken relationship not only between humans but also between humanity and God. It echoes later biblical narratives where humans question God's provision and intentions, such as in <a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a> when the Israelites complain about their conditions in the wilderness.<p><b>She gave me fruit from the tree,</b><br>Adam points to Eve's role in the transgression, emphasizing the act of receiving the fruit. This highlights the dynamics of temptation and influence, where one person's actions can lead another into sin. It parallels the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where one person's sin affects the entire community. The phrase also foreshadows the need for discernment and personal responsibility in the face of temptation, a theme further explored in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>.<p><b>And I ate it.</b><br>Here, Adam finally admits to his action, albeit after deflecting blame. This admission is crucial as it acknowledges the act of disobedience that led to the fall. Eating the fruit symbolizes the breach of trust and the breaking of God's command, which brought sin into the world. This act is contrasted with Jesus Christ, who, in the wilderness, resisted temptation and remained obedient to God (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), highlighting the redemptive work of Christ as the second Adam (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, living in the Garden of Eden.

The verse exposes the human tendency to rationalize sin rather than confess it plainly. Even so, God&#8217;s subsequent actions (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>) demonstrate His unwavering grace, providing a way forward while still holding Adam accountable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12, 13) <span class= "bld">She gave me . . . --</span>There is again in Adam the same passiveness which we noticed on <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm" title="And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her; and he did eat.">Genesis 3:6</a>. He has little sense of responsibility, and no feeling that he had a duty towards Eve, and ought to have watched over her, and helped her when tempted. It is a mistake to suppose that he wished to shift the blame, first upon Eve, and then upon God, who had given her to him; rather, he recapitulates the history, as if, in his view, it was a matter of course that he should act as he had done (see on <a href="/genesis/3-20.htm" title="And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.">Genesis 3:20</a>), and as if he had no sense that there was any blame whatever attaching to any one. His conscience still seems utterly unmoved. Far nobler is the woman's answer. She acknowledges that she had been led astray, and, under the influence of the serpent's deceit, had broken God's commandment.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
