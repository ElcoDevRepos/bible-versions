The ten-year period underscores the patience and faith required of Abram and Sarai, as they had been promised descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). This waiting period tests their faith and sets the stage for the subsequent actions taken by Sarai. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or a full measure in biblical numerology, suggesting that this was a complete period of testing.<p><b>his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar</b><br>Sarai's action of taking Hagar reflects the customs and legal practices of the ancient Near East, where a barren wife could give her maidservant to her husband to bear children on her behalf. Hagar, being Egyptian, may have been acquired during Abram and Sarai's earlier sojourn in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10-20</a>). This cultural practice, while accepted at the time, demonstrates a human attempt to fulfill divine promises through human means, contrasting with the faith-based approach God desires.<p><b>and gave her to Abram to be his wife</b><br>By giving Hagar to Abram as a wife, Sarai is attempting to secure the promised offspring through culturally acceptable means. This act introduces polygamy into Abram's family, which often leads to strife and complications, as seen in other biblical narratives (e.g., Jacob with Leah and Rachel). The decision reflects a lack of trust in God's timing and plan, leading to future conflict between Sarai and Hagar. This situation foreshadows the tension between the descendants of Ishmael (Hagar's son) and Isaac (Sarai's son), which is a recurring theme in biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Scripture records this practice, but subsequent strife (<a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4&#8211;6</a>) shows it was never God&#8217;s best (compare <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Sarai&#8217;s impatience resembles Eve&#8217;s impulse in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>&#8212;both women act independently of God&#8217;s explicit word. <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a> warns against &#8220;covering with a covering, but not of My Spirit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave her to Abram to be his wife</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;gave&#8221; echoes God&#8217;s earlier promise to &#8220;give&#8221; descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4&#8211;5</a>), but this is human giving, not divine giving.<p>&#8226; Abram accepts, making Hagar a secondary wife. While polygamy occurs in Genesis (e.g., <a href="/genesis/29-24.htm">Genesis 29:24&#8211;30</a>), every instance breeds rivalry and pain.

Scripture cross-references underline that God&#8217;s timing is perfect, human shortcuts sow conflict, and the promised seed would still arrive only by supernatural provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan.</span>--He was now, therefore, eighty-five years of age (see <a href="/genesis/16-16.htm" title="And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.">Genesis 16:16</a> and <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm" title="So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.">Genesis 12:4</a>), and this long delay had not only tried his faith, but brought him and Sarai to the conclusion that the promised seed was to be obtained by other means.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his eighty-fifth, and her seventy-fifth year; a note of time introduced, probably, to account for their impatience in waiting for the promised seed), <span class="cmt_word">and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.</span> Afterwards styled a <span class="accented">pilgash</span> or concubine (<a href="/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>), she is here improperly called a wife <span class="accented">quae praeterDei legem is alienum thorum inducitur</span> (Calvin), from whom the <span class="accented">pilgash</span> or concubine differed <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in power over the family, which belonged solely to the true wife, not to the secondary; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the manner of espousal, which in the case of the former was accompanied with solemn rites of espousal and liberal gifts of dowry; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in privilege of issue, the offspring of the secondary wife having no title to inherit. The act of Sarai (cf. the similar behavior of Stratonice, the wife of King Deiotarus, who, according to Plutarch, gave her maid Electra to her husband, and so obtained an heir to the crown) is as little to be imitated as the conduct of Abram.
