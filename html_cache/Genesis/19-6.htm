This act of stepping outside indicates Lot's willingness to confront the mob and protect his visitors, who were actually angels. The cultural expectation of hospitality is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham's hospitality to the same visitors. Lot's actions can be compared to the protective nature of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity.<p><b>shutting the door behind him</b><br>By shutting the door behind him, Lot creates a barrier between the men of Sodom and his guests, symbolizing a separation between righteousness and wickedness. This act of closing the door can be seen as a protective measure, emphasizing the urgency and danger of the situation. It also foreshadows the divine judgment that will soon befall Sodom, as the door represents a boundary that the wicked cannot cross.
