This moment follows the dramatic reunion with his brothers who had previously sold him into slavery. Joseph's role as a leader and mediator is evident here, reflecting his God-given wisdom and position of authority in Egypt. This phrase highlights the restoration of familial relationships and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding their descendants.<p><b>I will go up and inform Pharaoh</b><br>Joseph's intention to approach Pharaoh demonstrates his high status in Egypt, second only to Pharaoh himself. This reflects the trust and favor he has earned, which is significant given his Hebrew origins. Joseph's relationship with Pharaoh is crucial for the survival of his family during the famine, showcasing God's providence and the unfolding of His plan for Israel. This also prefigures Christ as an intercessor, who goes before the Father on behalf of His people.<p><b>&#8216;My brothers and my father&#8217;s household from the land of Canaan have come to me</b><br>The mention of Canaan is significant as it is the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. The migration to Egypt is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, setting the stage for the eventual Exodus. This movement from Canaan to Egypt is part of God's sovereign plan, despite the temporary departure from the Promised Land. The phrase also underscores the theme of reconciliation and provision, as Joseph ensures the safety and sustenance of his family. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides for and reconciles His people to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.
