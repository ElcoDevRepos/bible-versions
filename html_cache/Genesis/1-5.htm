By naming the light "day," God establishes His sovereignty over creation. This act of naming is a recurring theme in Genesis, as seen when Adam names the animals (<a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19-20</a>). The term "day" here is significant as it sets the pattern for the human understanding of time, which is central to the biblical narrative. Theologically, light often symbolizes God's presence and truth, as seen in <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, where light represents the life and truth of Christ.<p><b>and the darkness He called &#8220;night.&#8221;</b><br>Darkness, in contrast to light, often symbolizes chaos, ignorance, or evil in biblical literature. By naming the darkness "night," God asserts control over it, indicating that even darkness is part of His creation and under His authority. This duality of light and darkness is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares He forms light and creates darkness, emphasizing His omnipotence.<p><b>And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the first day.</b><br>The phrase "evening and morning" establishes the Jewish understanding of a day, beginning at sunset. This sequence is foundational for the Hebrew calendar and is reflected in the observance of the Sabbath from Friday evening to Saturday evening. The concept of a "day" here has been the subject of much theological debate, particularly concerning the length of the creation days. Some interpret these as literal 24-hour periods, while others see them as symbolic of longer epochs. The "first day" marks the beginning of God's creative work, setting a pattern for the subsequent days of creation. This structure underscores the orderliness of God's creation, contrasting with ancient Near Eastern creation myths that often depict creation as arising from chaos.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who speaks light into existence and names the periods of light and darkness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/light.htm">Light</a></b><br>The first element of creation that God names, signifying order and structure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>The absence of light, also named by God, indicating His sovereignty over all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day.htm">Day</a></b><br>The period of light, named by God, marking the beginning of time as we understand it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/night.htm">Night</a></b><br>The period of darkness, named by God, completing the cycle of a full day.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God&#8217;s act of naming the light and darkness demonstrates His authority over creation.

Night.</span>--Before this distinction of night and day was possible there must have been outside the earth, not as yet the sun, but a bright phosphorescent mass, such as now enwraps that luminary; and, secondly, the earth must have begun to revolve upon its axis. Consequent upon this would be, not merely alternate periods of light and darkness, but also of heat and cold, from which would result important effects upon the formation of the earth's crust. Moreover, in thus giving "day" and "night" names, God ordained language, and that vocal sounds should be the symbols of things. This law already looks forward to the existence of man, the one being on earth who calls things by their names.<p><span class= "bld">And the evening and the morning.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And was an evening and was a morning day one, </span>the definite article not being used till <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm" title="And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.">Genesis 1:31</a>, when we have "day the sixth," which was also the last of the creative days.<p>The word "evening" means a <span class= "ital">mixture. </span>It is no longer the opaque darkness of a world without light, but the intermingling of light and darkness (comp. <a href="/context/zechariah/14-6.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:">Zechariah 14:6-7</a>). This is followed by a "morning," that is, a <span class= "ital">breaking forth </span>of light. Evening is placed first because there was a progress from a less to a greater brightness and order and beauty. The Jewish method of calculating the day from sunset to sunset was not the cause, but the result of this arrangement.<p><span class= "bld">The first day.</span>--A creative day is not a period of twenty-four hours, but an <span class= "ital">?on, </span>or period of indefinite duration, as the Bible itself teaches us. For in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a> the six days of this narrative are described as and summed up in one day, creation being there regarded, not in its successive stages, but as a whole. So by the common consent of commentators, the seventh day, or day of God's rest, is that age in which we are now living, and which will continue until the consummation of all things. So in <a href="/zechariah/14-7.htm" title="But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.">Zechariah 14:7</a> the whole Gospel dispensation is called "one day;" and constantly in Hebrew, as probably in all languages, <span class= "ital">day </span>is used in a very indefinite manner, as, for instance, in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>. Those, however, who adopt the very probable suggestion of Kurtz, that the revelation of the manner of creation was made in a succession of representations or pictures displayed before the mental vision of the tranced seer, have no difficulties. He saw the dark gloom of evening pierced by the bright morning light: that was day one. Again, an evening cleft by the light, and he saw an opening space expanding itself around the world: that was day two. Again darkness and light, and on the surface of the earth he saw the waters rushing down into the seas: that was day three. And so on. What else could he call these periods but days? But as St. Augustine pointed out, there was no sun then, and "it is very difficult for us to imagine what sort of days these could be" (<span class= "ital">De Civ. Dei, xi.</span> 6, 7). It must further be observed that this knowledge of the stages of creation could only have been given by revelation, and that the agreement of the Mosaic record with geology is so striking that there is no real difficulty in believing it to be inspired. The difficulties arise almost entirely from popular fallacies or the mistaken views of commentators. Geology has done noble service for religion in sweeping away the mean views of God's method of working which used formerly to prevail. We may add that among the Chaldeans a cosmic day was a period of 43,200 years, being the equivalent of the cycle of the procession of the equinoxes (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Les Origines de l'Histoire, </span>p. 233). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God called</span> (literally, called to) <span class="cmt_word">the light Day, and</span> (literally, to) <span class="cmt_word">the darkness he called Night</span>. "None but superficial thinkers," says Delitzsch, "<span class="accented">can</span> take offence at the idea of created things receiving names from God. The name of a thing is the expression of its nature. If the name be given by man, it fixes in a word the impression which it makes upon the human mind; but, when given by God, it expresses the reality, what the thing is in God's creation, and the place assigned it there by the side of other things." The things named were the light and the darkness; not the durations, but the phenomena. The names called were day, <span class="accented">yore</span>, and night, <span class="accented">layela</span>, which, again, were not time-measures, but character-descriptions. Ainsworth suggests that yore was intended to express "the tumult, stir, and business of the day," in all probability connecting it with <span class="accented">yam</span>, which depicts the foaming or the boiling of the sea; and that <span class="accented">layela</span>, in which he seems to detect the Latin <span class="accented">ululare</span>, is indicative of "<span class="accented">the</span> yelling or the howling of wild beasts at night." Gesenius derives the former from the unused root <span class="accented">yore</span>, which signifies to glow with heat, while the latter he associates with <span class="accented">lul</span>, also unused, to roll up, the idea being that the night wraps all things in obscurity. Macdonald sees in the naming of the creatures an expression of sovereignty and lordship, as when Adam named the beasts of the field. <span class="cmt_word">And the evening and the morning were the first day.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">And evening was</span> and <span class="accented">morning was</span>, <span class="accented">day one</span>. Considerable diversity of sentiment prevails with regard to the exact interpretation of these words. On the one hand, it is assumed that the first creative period is here described as an ordinary astronomical or sidereal day of twenty-four hours' duration, its constituent parts being characterized in the usual way, as an evening and a morning. In the judgment of Kalisch and others the peculiar phrase, "Evening was, and morning was," is simply equivalent to the later Hebrew compound "evening-morning" (<a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>), and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), both of which denote a natural or civil day, though this is challenged, in the case of the Hebrew compound, by Macdonald. The language of the fourth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>) is also appealed to as removing, it beyond the sphere of doubt that the evening and the morning referred to are-the component sections of an earthly day. As to the proper <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> of this initial day, however, the advocates of this interpretation are at variance among themselves; Delitzsch taking the terms <span class="accented">ereb</span> (literally, "the setting," from <span class="accented">arab</span>, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to mix; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to set, to depart, like the sun) <p>and <span class="accented">boker</span> (literally, "<span class="accented">the</span> breaking forth," from <span class="accented">bakar</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> cleave, to open) in an active sense, and applying the former to the first fading of the light, and the latter to the breaking of the dawn after the first interval of darkness has passed, thus reckoning the creative days from daybreak to daybreak; while Murphy and Kalisch, who agree with him in regarding the days as ordinary solar days, declare they must be reckoned, <span class="accented">Hebraico</span> more, from sunset to sunset. But if the first day commenced with an evening or obscure period (Has <span class="accented">ereb</span> no connection with <span class="accented">arab</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> mix? May it not describe the condition of things when light and darkness were commingled?), that can be discovered only in the chaotic <span class="accented">darkness</span> out of which the light sprang. Hence, on the other hand, as it seems improbable that this was of no more than twelve hours' duration, and as the presumption is that the light-period would be commensurate in length, it has been argued that day one was not a sun-measured day, but a period of indefinite extent. Of course the length of day one practically determines the length of all the six. If it was a solar day, then they must be considered such. But as the present sidereal arrangements for the measurement of time were not then established, it is clearly gratuitous to proceed on the assumption that it was Hence, neither is it to be accepted without-demonstration that they were not likewise periods of prolonged duration. It is obvious they were if it was; and that it was appears to be suggested by the terms in which it is described. This conclusion, that the creation days were long periods, and not simply solar days, is confirmed by a variety of considerations.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;
