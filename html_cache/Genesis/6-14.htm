The term "ark" is unique, used here and in the story of Moses' basket, symbolizing salvation and deliverance. "Gopher wood" is a term not found elsewhere in Scripture, leading to various interpretations, including cypress or cedar, known for durability. This wood choice emphasizes the ark's role as a vessel of preservation. The construction of the ark prefigures Christ as the ultimate means of salvation, providing refuge from judgment.<p><b>make rooms in the ark</b><br>The instruction to "make rooms" suggests organization and provision for all living creatures. This reflects God's orderliness and care in His plans. The Hebrew word for "rooms" can also mean "nests," indicating a place of safety and rest. This aspect of the ark can be seen as a type of the church, where believers find refuge and community. The detailed preparation mirrors the meticulous care God takes in His redemptive plan.<p><b>and coat it with pitch inside and out.</b><br>The use of "pitch" for sealing the ark is significant for its protective function, ensuring the ark's watertight integrity. The Hebrew word for "pitch" is similar to the word for "atonement," symbolizing covering and protection from judgment. This act of sealing can be seen as a type of Christ's atoning work, covering believers from the wrath of God. The dual application "inside and out" underscores the comprehensive nature of God's salvation, safeguarding both the internal and external aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.
