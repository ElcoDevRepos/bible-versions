It was a significant port city and a center of trade and commerce. The mention of Sidon as a boundary marker indicates the northern extent of the land of Canaan. This area was known for its influence and wealth, often associated with the Canaanites' maritime prowess. Sidon is frequently mentioned in the Bible, including in the context of Israel's interactions with surrounding nations (e.g., <a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>, <a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>).<p><b>toward Gerar as far as Gaza</b><br>Gerar was a Philistine city located in the Negev region, often associated with the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20:1, 26</a>:1). Gaza, another significant Philistine city, marked the southwestern boundary of Canaan. These cities were part of the Philistine pentapolis and played crucial roles in the narratives of the Judges and the early monarchy of Israel (e.g., <a href="/judges/16.htm">Judges 16:1-3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>). The mention of these cities highlights the extent of Canaan's influence and the challenges Israel would face from these regions.<p><b>and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim</b><br>These cities are infamous for their destruction due to their wickedness, as recounted in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. They were located in the plain of the Jordan, near the Dead Sea. The mention of these cities serves as a geographical marker but also as a moral and theological reference point, illustrating the consequences of sin and God's judgment. The destruction of these cities is often cited in later biblical texts as a warning against immorality (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, <a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28-30</a>).<p><b>as far as Lasha</b><br>Lasha is less well-known, with its exact location remaining uncertain. It is mentioned here as the eastern boundary of Canaan. The inclusion of Lasha in the list of boundary markers underscores the comprehensive nature of the description, encompassing the full extent of the land associated with the Canaanites. This comprehensive boundary description sets the stage for the later narratives of Israel's conquest and settlement in the land, as promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The grandson of Noah and the progenitor of the Canaanites, whose land is described in this passage.
