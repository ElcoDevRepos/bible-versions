This act reflects the cultural practices of the ancient Near East, where gifts were often used to pacify potential adversaries or to show respect. The gifts symbolize Jacob's attempt to seek favor and forgiveness from Esau, whom he had wronged years earlier by taking his birthright and blessing (Genesis 27). This act of sending gifts can be seen as a precursor to the concept of atonement, where offerings are made to restore broken relationships, paralleling the sacrificial system later established in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>while he spent the night in the camp</b><br>Jacob's decision to stay in the camp while his gifts went ahead indicates a moment of introspection and preparation. This night is significant as it precedes his encounter with God, where he wrestles with the angel (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>). The camp represents a place of solitude and reflection, where Jacob is left alone to confront his fears and seek divine intervention. This setting foreshadows the transformative encounter that will change Jacob's identity to Israel, symbolizing a new beginning and covenant relationship with God. The night also serves as a metaphor for the spiritual darkness and struggle Jacob faces before receiving God's blessing and assurance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

By doing so he followed a well-known principle later expressed in <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8217;s gift opens doors for him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The offering was an act of repentance and reconciliation, like the peace-offerings Moses would later prescribe (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>). Jacob was not buying forgiveness; he was demonstrating humility, much as Abigail did when she hurried ahead with provisions to avert David&#8217;s wrath (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The gifts remind us that restoration often requires tangible steps. Jesus echoes this heart attitude: &#8220;First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went on before him</b><p>&#8226; Jacob deliberately placed distance between himself and the herds: &#8220;He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself&#8230; &#8216;Go on ahead of me&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-16.htm">Genesis 32:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This forward movement served two purposes:<p>&#8211; It prepared Esau&#8217;s heart before the face-to-face meeting, just as the Baptist later &#8220;went before&#8221; the Lord to prepare the way (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>).<p>&#8211; It kept Jacob in a posture of dependence on God rather than on his own strength, paralleling the lesson Israel would learn when the Ark went before the people (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Sending the gifts first also showed continued faith that God would fulfil the promise rehearsed in <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>: &#8220;I will surely make you prosper.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while he spent the night</b><p>&#8226; Jacob chose a pause instead of pressing forward, giving space for personal prayer and reflection. Earlier that evening he had already prayed earnestly (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Night often marks decisive encounters with God&#8212;think of Samuel hearing the Lord in the dark (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3-10</a>) or Jesus praying alone before sunrise (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p>&#8226; This waiting time was not wasted; it became the threshold for the wrestling match that begins in <a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24</a>, where Jacob&#8217;s name&#8212;and future&#8212;are transformed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the camp</b><p>&#8226; The camp recalls verse 7, where Jacob had divided his household into &#8220;two camps&#8221; for protection, yet here he stays within one of them, entrusting the other to God.<p>&#8226; Camps in Scripture symbolize both vulnerability and divine presence. Israel later learned that &#8220;the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>). Jacob&#8217;s decision to remain there reflects confidence that God was, as earlier at Mahanaim, encamping with him (<a href="/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; By remaining in the camp Jacob models a balance between prudent action (sending gifts) and steadfast faith (dwelling where God placed him), anticipating the balance believers are called to live out (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-21.htm">Genesis 32:21</a> captures a careful blend of practical wisdom and spiritual trust. Jacob sends peace-gifts ahead to open Esau&#8217;s heart, yet he himself lingers in the camp, creating space for a life-changing night with God. The verse demonstrates that genuine reconciliation combines humble action with prayerful dependence&#8212;an enduring pattern for every follower of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">went the present over Before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
