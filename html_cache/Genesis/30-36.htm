In the ancient Near Eastern context, a "three-day journey" was a common measure of distance, suggesting a deliberate and substantial gap to prevent immediate interaction or interference. This separation underscores the tension and mistrust between Laban and Jacob, as Laban seeks to protect his interests by distancing himself from Jacob. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine intervention in the Bible, which may imply that this separation was part of God's providential plan for Jacob's eventual independence and prosperity.<p><b>while Jacob was shepherding the rest of Laban&#8217;s flocks</b><br>Jacob's role as a shepherd is significant, as it reflects his ongoing service and commitment to Laban, despite the strained relationship. Shepherding was a common occupation in the patriarchal period, requiring skill and dedication. This phrase highlights Jacob's diligence and integrity in fulfilling his responsibilities, even as he prepares for his own future. The imagery of shepherding is also a recurring biblical motif, often associated with leadership and care, foreshadowing Jacob's eventual role as the patriarch of the Israelite tribes. Additionally, shepherding connects to the typology of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd, who cares for His flock with devotion and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

The words "and Jacob fed," &c., are added to correct the natural supposition that he would at least give some part of his time and care to his own flocks, whereas it was his personal duty to attend only to those of Laban. The verse, nevertheless, is awkward, and the Syriac has probably preserved the right-reading: "And he set three days' journey between himself and Laban: and Jacob fed the flock of Laban that was left."
