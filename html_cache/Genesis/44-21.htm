Joseph, now a powerful figure in Egypt, is addressing his brothers who do not recognize him. The term "servants" here is used by the brothers to show respect and submission to Joseph's authority. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where hierarchy and respect for authority were paramount. The brothers' use of "servants" also highlights the dramatic irony, as they are unaware they are speaking to their own brother.<p><b>&#8216;Bring him down to me</b><br>Joseph is requesting that his brothers bring Benjamin, the youngest brother, to Egypt. This request is significant because Benjamin is the only other son of Rachel, Joseph's mother, and is particularly beloved by their father, Jacob. The phrase "bring him down" indicates the geographical movement from Canaan to Egypt, which is southward and downhill. This journey would have been significant, involving travel through desert regions and across the Sinai Peninsula.<p><b>so that I can see him for myself.&#8217;</b><br>Joseph's desire to see Benjamin is deeply personal. It reflects his longing for family connection and reconciliation. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it sets the stage for the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity to his brothers. The phrase "see him for myself" underscores Joseph's need for personal assurance and connection, which is a recurring theme in the story of Joseph. This also foreshadows the eventual reunion and restoration of the family, which is a type of Christ's work of reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is testing his brothers to see if they have changed since they sold him into slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>- Joseph's younger brother, whom Joseph requests to see, testing his brothers' integrity and loyalty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>- One of Joseph's brothers, who plays a key role in the account by pleading for Benjamin's safety.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>- The land where Joseph has risen to power and where the events of this chapter unfold.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>- The father of Joseph and his brothers, who is deeply concerned about the safety of his youngest son, Benjamin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/testing_and_transformation.htm">Testing and Transformation</a></b><br>Joseph's request to see Benjamin is a test of his brothers' character.
