The mention of both together emphasizes the inclusion of Ishmael in the covenantal sign of circumcision, despite the later focus on Isaac as the child of promise. This act signifies the importance of the entire household being part of God's covenant, not just the direct line of promise.<p><b>were circumcised</b><br>Circumcision is introduced in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a> as the physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham. It is a significant ritual in Jewish tradition, symbolizing purity, obedience, and belonging to God's chosen people. The act of circumcision here is a demonstration of Abraham's obedience to God's command. It also prefigures the New Testament concept of circumcision of the heart, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, where true belonging to God is marked by inward transformation rather than external rituals.<p><b>on the same day</b><br>The phrase "on the same day" underscores the immediacy and completeness of Abraham's obedience to God's command. It reflects a sense of urgency and total commitment to fulfilling God's requirements. This simultaneous act of circumcision for both Abraham and Ishmael signifies unity and collective participation in the covenant. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of unity in Christ, where all believers, regardless of background, are part of the same spiritual family (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Originally named Abram, he is the patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

THE ORIGIN OF CIRCUMCISION. The determination of this question does not appear of paramount importance, yet the ascertained results may be briefly indicated. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> According to Herodotus (2. 104) circumcision was observed as a custom of primitive antiquity among the Colchiaus, Ethiopians, and Egyptians, by the last of whom it was communicated to the Syrians of Palestine and the Phoenicians. It is, however, uncertain Whether among the Egyptians the practice was universal, as Philo and Herodotus assert, or limited to the priesthood, as Origen believed; and equally doubtful whether the Egyptians themselves may not have adopted it from the Hebrews in the time of Joseph, instead of from the Ethiopians, as appears to be the judgment of Kalisch. Against the idea that circumcision was a national and universal observance among the Egyptians in the time of Abraham, it has been urged that the male servants of the patriarch, some of whom were Egyptians (<a href="/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>), were not circumcised till Abraham was commanded to perform the rite; that Ishmael, the son of an Egyptian mother, remained uncircumcised till the same time; and that the daughter of Pharaoh recognized Moses as a Hebrew child, which, it is supposed, she could not have done had circumcision been generally practiced among her own people. On the other hand, it is contended that the absence of details as to how the rite should be performed seems to imply that already circumcision was familiar to Abraham; and by some modern Egyptologists it is asserted that an examination of ancient mummies and sculptures, in which circumcision is a distinctive mark between the Egyptians and their enemies, shows that the ceremony must have been in use not among the priests only, but throughout the nation generally so early as the time of the fourth dynasty, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> , or considerably earlier than the time of Abraham. Still <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> though it should be held as indubitably established that circumcision was a prevalent custom among the Egyptians in the time of Abraham, it would not follow that the Hebrews adopted it from them. On the contrary, the Biblical narrative expressly mentions that its observance by the patriarch and- his household was due to a Divine command, and was connected with a religious significance which was altogether foreign to the Egyptians and others by whom that rite was practiced. Among the reasons for its adoption by the heathen nations of antiquity have been assigned, among the Ethiopians, a prophylactic design to ward off certain painful, and often incurable, disorders; among the Egyptians, a regard to cleanliness; and perhaps among the priesthood of the latter country a semi-religious idea (the deification of the generative powers) was associated with a practice which was commonly regarded as enhancing productivity; but the import of the ceremony as enjoined upon the father of the faithful was as widely as possible removed from every one of these ideas, being connected with spiritual conceptions of which the heathen world was entirely ignorant. That a heathen custom should have been adopted by Jehovah and elevated to the rank and connected with the spiritual significance of a religious sign will not occur as a difficulty to those who remember that the rainbow, a well-known natural phenomenon, was selected as the sign for Noah's covenant, and that Christian baptism is a similar transformation of a previously existing ceremony by which Gentile proselytes were admitted to the Hebrew Church. <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/17-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Abraham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;&#183;h&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_85.htm">Strong's 85: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham -- 'exalted father', the father of the Jewish nation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ishmael</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yi&#353;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3458.htm">Strong's 3458: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ishmael -- 'God hears', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were circumcised</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(nim&#183;m&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4135.htm">Strong's 4135: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut short, curtail, to blunt, to destroy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on the</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">same</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1433;&#1510;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;&#7779;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6106.htm">Strong's 6106: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bone, the body, the substance, selfsame</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/17-26.htm">Genesis 17:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/17-26.htm">OT Law: Genesis 17:26 In the same day both Abraham (Gen.
