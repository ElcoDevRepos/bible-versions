Jacob, also known as Israel, had come to Egypt with his family due to a severe famine in Canaan. This encounter between Pharaoh and Jacob highlights the respect and curiosity Pharaoh had for Jacob, who was the patriarch of the Israelites.<br><br>In the ancient Near Eastern context, age was often associated with wisdom and divine favor. Pharaoh's question reflects a cultural respect for elders and an acknowledgment of Jacob's status. This moment also underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<br><br>Jacob's response, which follows in the subsequent verses, reveals his perspective on his life as a sojourner, emphasizing the transient nature of human existence. This theme resonates with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>, where believers are described as strangers and pilgrims on the earth.<br><br>The interaction between Pharaoh and Jacob can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Jacob, representing the people of God, is received and provided for by a foreign ruler, prefiguring the acceptance and provision found in Christ for all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt during the time of Joseph.

By initiating the conversation, the king yields the spotlight to Jacob, a shepherd from Canaan, acknowledging that the one standing before him carries a story worth hearing. Similar moments appear when kings honor God&#8217;s servants&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar with Daniel (<a href="/daniel/2-26.htm">Daniel 2:26</a>) and the Queen of Sheba with Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-3.htm">1 Kings 10:3</a>). Those who fear God often find doors opened before rulers because, as <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a> notes, &#8220;He will stand before kings.&#8221; Jacob&#8217;s presence is another fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to exalt His covenant people (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many</b><p>The inquiry about &#8220;many&#8221; points to the ancient recognition that longevity could imply divine favor. While a long life is a blessing (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), Scripture reminds us that it is ultimately the Lord who numbers our days (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s emphasis on quantity also foreshadows Jacob&#8217;s response that quality counts more than mere total years (<a href="/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Longevity was highly esteemed in patriarchal culture.<p>&#8226; Pharaoh measures greatness by length; God measures by faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>years</b><p>Years mark the passing of God-appointed seasons (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>). Jacob&#8217;s age (130) links him to the lineage of long-lived patriarchs&#8212;yet he will testify that his &#8220;years&#8230;have been few and hard&#8221; compared with theirs. The verse therefore introduces the theme that time, though important, is merely a backdrop for the unfolding of God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have you lived?</b><p>The phrase shifts from counting years to reflecting on life&#8217;s journey. Jacob&#8217;s answer will recount pilgrimage, trials, and God&#8217;s faithfulness. <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a> echoes this outlook: &#8220;They confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.&#8221; Pharaoh&#8217;s question invites Jacob to bear witness, and Jacob responds by framing his life as a sojourn, emphasizing dependence on God rather than earthly achievements.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh asked.</b><p>The conversation underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty in placing His servant before the world&#8217;s most powerful ruler. Joseph&#8217;s earlier interpretation of dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>) demonstrated that God, not Pharaoh, held ultimate authority. Now, through Jacob, the covenant blessing flows to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/47-10.htm">Genesis 47:10</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s respectful inquiry fulfills <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>: &#8220;I will bless those who bless you,&#8221; as the Egyptian monarch honors Jacob and, by extension, Jacob&#8217;s God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8</a> records more than polite court etiquette; it captures a divine appointment. Pharaoh&#8217;s simple question opens a window for Jacob to testify that God, not years, defines a life. The verse highlights respect for God&#8217;s people, the fleeting nature of time, and the faithfulness of the Lord who orchestrates meetings between shepherds and kings to advance His covenant purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou</span>? - literally, How many <span class="accented">are the days of the years of thy life? <span class="cmt_word"></span>And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage</span> (literally, <span class="accented">of my sojournings</span>, wanderings to and fro without any settled condition) are <span class="cmt_word">an hundred and thirty years</span>. Since Joseph was now thirty-seven years of age (<a href="/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a>), it is apparent that he was born in his father's ninety-first year; and since this event took place in the fourteenth year of Jacob's residence in Padan-aram (<a href="/genesis/30-25.htm">Genesis 30:25</a>), it is equally apparent that Jacob was seventy-seven years of age when he left Beersheba after surreptitiously securing the patriarchal blessing (<a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</span> As Jacob s life fell short of that of his ancestors in respect of duration (witness the 175 years of Abraham, and the 180 of Isaac), so it greatly surpassed theirs in respect of the miseries that were crowded into it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/47-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;How many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(kam&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have you lived?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;ye&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/47-8.htm">Genesis 47:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/47-8.htm">OT Law: Genesis 47:8 Pharaoh said to Jacob How many (Gen.
