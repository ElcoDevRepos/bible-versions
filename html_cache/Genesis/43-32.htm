The separation in dining reflects the social and cultural hierarchies of the time. Joseph, as the governor of Egypt, is served separately, highlighting his elevated status. His brothers, unaware of his true identity, are treated as foreigners. The Egyptians are also served separately, indicating a strict adherence to social customs and norms. This separation underscores the tension between the Egyptians and the Hebrews, a theme that will continue throughout the Israelites' history in Egypt.<p><b>They ate separately because the Egyptians would not eat with the Hebrews,</b><br>This phrase highlights the cultural and ethnic divisions of the time. Egyptians considered themselves superior to other peoples, including the Hebrews. This separation in dining practices is indicative of broader social prejudices and taboos. The Egyptians' refusal to eat with the Hebrews reflects a deep-seated cultural disdain, which is consistent with the broader narrative of the Israelites' eventual enslavement in Egypt. This separation also foreshadows the eventual exodus of the Israelites, as God calls them to be a distinct and separate people.<p><b>since that was detestable to them.</b><br>The term "detestable" indicates a strong aversion, suggesting that the Egyptians viewed the Hebrews as ritually or socially impure. This aversion may have been rooted in religious or cultural beliefs, as the Egyptians had a complex system of purity laws and social customs. This separation can be seen as a precursor to the later laws given to the Israelites, which also emphasize separation and holiness. The detestability of the Hebrews to the Egyptians sets the stage for the eventual conflict and deliverance narrative that unfolds in the book of Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is hosting a meal for his brothers.
