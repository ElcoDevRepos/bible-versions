Shechem's actions and character are central to the events of <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>. His youth may imply impulsiveness and a lack of wisdom, which is evident in his actions towards Dinah.<p><b>who was the most respected of all his father&#8217;s household</b><br>Shechem held a position of honor and influence within his family and community. This respect could be due to his status as the heir or his personal qualities. His influence is significant in the narrative, as it suggests that his actions could sway the decisions of his family and people.<p><b>did not hesitate to fulfill this request</b><br>Shechem's eagerness to comply with the demands of Jacob's sons indicates his strong desire to marry Dinah. This haste can be seen as a reflection of his infatuation or love for her, despite the circumstances of their initial encounter.<p><b>because he was delighted with Jacob&#8217;s daughter</b><br>Shechem's delight in Dinah suggests a deep attraction or affection, which may have been genuine despite the morally questionable nature of their relationship. This phrase highlights the personal and emotional motivations behind his actions, contrasting with the broader social and familial implications.<br><br>Connections to other scripture can be seen in the broader narrative of Genesis, where family dynamics and inter-tribal relations often lead to conflict and resolution.

Earlier the narrative calls him &#8220;the prince of the land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), showing a real historical figure with political influence.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently notes significant young men who shape events&#8212;Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>), David before Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>).<p>&#8226; The text&#8217;s literal wording reminds us that God records individuals by name and deed, underscoring the factual accuracy of the account.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was the most respected of all his father&#8217;s household</b><p>Shechem&#8217;s reputation carried weight. &#8220;Respected&#8221; (or &#8220;honored&#8221;) echoes the value of a good name (<a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Samuel, who &#8220;grew in favor with the LORD and with men&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>), Shechem enjoyed esteem among his people.<p>&#8226; His standing gives context: a highly regarded heir is now negotiating with Jacob&#8217;s family, making the coming deception by Dinah&#8217;s brothers even more startling.<p>&#8226; The verse testifies that earthly honor cannot cover moral failure; public esteem did not erase the sin committed earlier (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did not hesitate to fulfill this request</b><p>The &#8220;request&#8221; was the call to circumcision laid down by Jacob&#8217;s sons (<a href="/genesis/34-14.htm">Genesis 34:14-17</a>). Shechem&#8217;s immediate agreement shows urgency: &#8220;I hurried and did not delay to obey Your commands&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>) reflects a similar eagerness, though in Shechem&#8217;s case the obedience was toward men, not God.<p>&#8226; Readiness without reflection can be dangerous. <a href="/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a> warns, &#8220;It is not good to have zeal without knowledge.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet swiftness itself is commended when directed toward righteousness&#8212;Abraham rose early to obey (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>). Shechem&#8217;s haste highlights motive rather than virtue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he was delighted with Jacob&#8217;s daughter</b><p>Verse 3 already noted, &#8220;His soul was drawn to Dinah&#8230; and he loved the young woman&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/34-3.htm">Genesis 34:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine affection is not the same as godly love; Solomon also &#8220;clung in love&#8221; to foreign women who turned his heart (<a href="/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Desire can propel decisive action&#8212;good or ill. Song of Songs 2:3 pictures delighted love in purity, while here the delight follows violation.<p>&#8226; Shechem&#8217;s delight drove him to accept a painful sign of covenant he did not truly understand, illustrating how passion can mimic devotion without submitting to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a> reveals a respected young leader who, captivated by Dinah, rushed to meet the conditions set by her brothers. His social honor, swift compliance, and personal delight combine to show how human reputation and emotional desire can prompt immediate action, yet fail to address underlying sin. The verse stands as a literal, historical snapshot reminding readers that true righteousness requires more than eagerness and esteem&#8212;it demands obedience to God&#8217;s standards above all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The young man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;na&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
