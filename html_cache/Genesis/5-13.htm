Mahalalel, whose name can mean "praise of God," is part of the lineage leading to Noah and ultimately to Jesus Christ, as outlined in the genealogies of the Gospels. The naming of children often held significant meaning, reflecting the parents' faith or circumstances. This lineage emphasizes the faithfulness of God in preserving a remnant through whom His promises would be fulfilled.<p><b>Kenan lived 840 years</b><br>The long lifespans recorded in Genesis are a subject of much discussion. They reflect a pre-Flood world where conditions may have been different, allowing for extended longevity. These ages also serve to bridge the gap between Adam and the patriarchs, maintaining continuity in the narrative. Theologically, these long lifespans can be seen as a testament to the vitality of early humanity and the effects of sin gradually diminishing human longevity over generations.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase underscores the command given to Adam and Eve to "be fruitful and multiply." It highlights the growth of the human population and the spread of humanity across the earth. The mention of other sons and daughters, though not named, indicates the expansion of families and the establishment of communities.
