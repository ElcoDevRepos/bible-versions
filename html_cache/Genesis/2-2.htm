The number seven often symbolizes completeness and perfection in the Bible, seen in various contexts such as the seven days of creation, the seven seals in Revelation, and the sevenfold Spirit of God. This day sets a precedent for the Sabbath, a day of rest and worship, which becomes a central aspect of Jewish and Christian practice.<p><b>God had finished the work He had been doing;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's role as the Creator who completes His work. The completion of creation signifies that everything was made according to His perfect design and purpose. The idea of God finishing His work is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus declares, "It is finished" on the cross, signifying the completion of His redemptive work. This parallel highlights the continuity of God's plan from creation to redemption.<p><b>so on that day He rested</b><br>God's rest is not due to fatigue but serves as a model for humanity. It introduces the concept of Sabbath rest, which is later codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). This rest is a cessation from labor, allowing for reflection, worship, and renewal. It points to a future rest for believers, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>, where the ultimate rest is found in Christ.<p><b>from all His work.</b><br>The phrase underscores the totality of God's creative acts. It implies that creation was complete and perfect, lacking nothing. This cessation from work is a divine example for humans to follow, emphasizing the importance of rest and the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over creation. It also foreshadows the eternal rest believers will experience in the new creation, where God's work of redemption and restoration is fully realized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who completed His work of creation and rested on the seventh day, setting a precedent for rest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventh_day.htm">Seventh Day</a></b><br>The day God chose to rest, marking the completion of creation and establishing the concept of the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_rest.htm">The Principle of Rest</a></b><br>God&#8217;s rest on the seventh day establishes a divine principle of rest.

The laws given in these six days still continue their activity; they are still maintained, and there may even be with them progress and development. There is also something special on this seventh day; for in it the work of redemption was willed by the Father, wrought by the Son, and applied by the Holy Ghost. But there is no creative activity, as when vegetable or animal life began, or when a free agent first walked erect upon a world given him to subdue.<p>The substitution, in the LXX. and Syriac, of the <span class= "ital">sixth </span>for the seventh day, as that on which God ended His work, was probably made in order to avoid even the appearance of Elohim having put the finishing touches to creation on the Sabbath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And on the seventh day God</span> (Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">ended his work which he had made.</span> To avert the possibility of imagining that any portion of the seventh day was consumed in working, which the English version seems to favor, the LXX., the Samaritan, and Syriac versions insert the <span class="accented">sixth</span> day in the text instead of the seventh.

"He who fainteth not, neither is weary" (<a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>), can be conceived of neither as resting nor as needing rest through either exhaustion or fatigue. Cessation from previous occupation is all that is implied in the figure, and is quite compatible with continuous activity in other directions. <a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a> represents the Father as working from that period onward in the preservation and redemption of that world which by his preceding labors he had created and made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And by the seventh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
