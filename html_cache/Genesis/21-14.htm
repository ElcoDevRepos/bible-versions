So the "children who mocked Elisha" (<a href="/2_kings/2-23.htm" title="And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.">2Kings 2:23</a>) were doubtless grown young men. In <a href="/genesis/21-18.htm" title="Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in your hand; for I will make him a great nation.">Genesis 21:18</a>, Ishmael is called "a lad;" shortly afterwards he was able to maintain himself and Hagar with his bow (<a href="/genesis/21-20.htm" title="And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelled in the wilderness, and became an archer.">Genesis 21:20</a>), and his mother took a wife for him from Egypt (<a href="/genesis/21-21.htm" title="And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.">Genesis 21:21</a>). The narrative, therefore, does not represent Ishmael as a small child, and the idea has probably arisen from the supposition that Abraham placed Ishmael, as well as the supply of food, on Hagar's shoulder.<span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham rose up early in the morning</span>, - hastening to put in force the Divine instructions (cf. <a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8</a>, Abraham; <a href="/genesis/20-8.htm">Genesis 20:8</a>, Abimelech; <a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>, Jacob) - <span class="cmt_word">and took bread, and a bottle of water,</span> - the bottle, from a root signifying to enclose (Furst); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), was composed of skin, the material of which the earliest carrying vessels were constructed (cf. <a href="/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4, 13</a>; <a href="/judges/4-19.htm">Judges 4:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>).
