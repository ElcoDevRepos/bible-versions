Wells were vital for survival in the arid regions of the Middle East, providing necessary water for people, livestock, and agriculture. By stopping up the wells, the Philistines were engaging in an act of hostility and economic warfare, aiming to drive Isaac away by cutting off his water supply. This action reflects the ongoing tension and territorial disputes between the Philistines and the descendants of Abraham. In a broader biblical context, wells often symbolize life and sustenance, and their obstruction can be seen as an attempt to thwart God's provision.<p><b>that his father&#8217;s servants had dug</b><br>The reference to Abraham's servants highlights the continuity of God's promises and blessings from one generation to the next. Abraham, as the patriarch, had established these wells as part of securing the land God promised to him and his descendants. The act of digging wells was labor-intensive and signified a claim to the land. The Philistines' actions can be seen as an attempt to erase Abraham's legacy and disrupt the inheritance of his descendants. This phrase underscores the importance of heritage and the challenges faced in maintaining God's promises amidst opposition.<p><b>in the days of his father Abraham.</b><br>This phrase situates the events within the historical context of Abraham's life, emphasizing the long-standing nature of the conflict over resources and territory. Abraham's time was marked by God's covenant promises, including the promise of land, descendants, and blessing. The mention of "the days of his father Abraham" serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant, despite human opposition. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's unfolding plan through the patriarchs, leading ultimately to the fulfillment of His promises in Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate heir of Abraham's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the central figure in this chapter.

Following upon this came an express command of the king to depart, which Isaac obeyed; for he had sought refuge there because of the famine, and had no right to continue at Gerar, if the people refused their hospitality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>), <span class="cmt_word">the philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</span> This act, commonly regarded as legitimate in ancient warfare, was practically to Isaac an act of expulsion, it being impossible for flocks and herds to exist without access to water supplies.
