This appearance signifies the importance of the message being delivered. The angel of the LORD appears at critical moments in the Old Testament, such as to Hagar here, to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, and to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>. This suggests divine intervention and guidance in pivotal moments of biblical history.<p><b>Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son:</b><br>This announcement is reminiscent of other biblical birth announcements, such as those to Sarah, Rebekah, and Mary. It emphasizes God's sovereignty over life and His involvement in the unfolding of His plan. The promise of a son to Hagar, an Egyptian maidservant, highlights God's care for all people, not just the chosen lineage of Abraham.<p><b>And you shall name him Ishmael:</b><br>The name "Ishmael" means "God hears," reflecting the divine response to Hagar's distress. Naming in the Bible often signifies character or destiny, and Ishmael's name is a perpetual reminder of God's attentiveness to human suffering. This act of naming by God Himself underscores the significance of Ishmael's role in biblical history.<p><b>for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction:</b><br>This phrase underscores God's compassion and responsiveness to human suffering. Hagar, though a servant and outsider, is not beyond God's care. This mirrors other instances where God hears the cries of His people, such as the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that God is near to the brokenhearted (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>). The acknowledgment of Hagar's affliction highlights God's justice and mercy, themes that resonate throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarai (later Sarah), who becomes the mother of Ishmael.

The word &#8220;behold&#8221; invites Hagar&#8212;and us&#8212;to recognize what God has done, much like the announcements to Sarah (<a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9-10</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and will bear a son</b><p>God specifies the child&#8217;s gender, paralleling promises about Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>).
