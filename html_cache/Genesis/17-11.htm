It involved the removal of the foreskin of the male genitalia, a practice that was not unique to the Israelites but was given a unique theological significance in this context. In the ancient Near East, circumcision was practiced by several cultures, but for the Israelites, it symbolized their distinct identity and commitment to God. This act was to be performed on the eighth day after birth, as later specified in <a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>, which aligns with modern medical understanding that blood clotting is optimal on this day. Theologically, circumcision represented the cutting away of impurity and a dedication to holiness, prefiguring the New Testament concept of spiritual circumcision of the heart (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).<p><b>and this will be a sign of the covenant</b><br>The covenant referred to here is the Abrahamic Covenant, a foundational element of biblical theology. This covenant included promises of land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 15</a>:18-21). The sign of circumcision was a perpetual reminder of God's promises and the Israelites' obligation to live in obedience to Him. In biblical terms, a "sign" is a visible, tangible reminder of a spiritual reality, similar to the rainbow as a sign of the Noahic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>). Circumcision as a sign also pointed forward to the New Covenant, where baptism serves as a sign of faith and inclusion in the community of believers (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-12</a>).<p><b>between Me and you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and relational aspect of the covenant. It was not merely a legal contract but a personal commitment between God and Abraham, extending to his descendants. The use of "Me and you" highlights the intimate relationship God desires with His people, a theme that runs throughout Scripture. This covenant relationship is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called into a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>). The covenant with Abraham is foundational for understanding God's redemptive plan, culminating in the person and work of Jesus, who fulfills the promises made to Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-maker who establishes a sign of His promise with Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch chosen by God to be the father of many nations, receiving the covenant promise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>The physical act and sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A solemn agreement between God and Abraham, signifying a lasting relationship and promise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_abraham.htm">Descendants of Abraham</a></b><br>The future generations who are to uphold the covenant through the practice of circumcision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sign_of_the_covenant.htm">Sign of the Covenant</a></b><br>Circumcision was a physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham, symbolizing a deeper spiritual truth of belonging to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Abraham's willingness to undergo circumcision and to circumcise his household demonstrates obedience and faith in God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_significance.htm">Spiritual Significance</a></b><br>In the New Testament, circumcision is seen as a metaphor for the cutting away of sin and living a life dedicated to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_righteousness.htm">Faith and Righteousness</a></b><br>Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness before the act of circumcision, highlighting that faith, not works, is the basis of righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_and_fulfillment.htm">Continuity and Fulfillment</a></b><br>The covenant with Abraham finds its fulfillment in Christ, who brings a new covenant that includes all believers, Jew and Gentile alike.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_17_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_circumcision_a_covenant_sign.htm">What is the significance of circumcision as a "sign of the covenant" in Genesis 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_17_11_and_spiritual_circumcision.htm">How does Genesis 17:11 connect to the New Testament understanding of spiritual circumcision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Why_circumcision_as_God_s_covenant_sign.htm">Why did God choose circumcision as a physical sign for His covenant people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Genesis_17_11_covenant_today.htm">How can believers today apply the principle of covenant commitment from Genesis 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_17_11_on_obedience_and_faith.htm">What does Genesis 17:11 teach about obedience and faith in God's promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_circumcision_a_covenant_sign_2.htm">Why does Genesis 17:11 emphasize circumcision as a covenant sign between God and Abraham's descendants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Circumcision_s_link_to_modern_Christianity.htm">How does the practice of circumcision in Genesis 17:11 relate to modern Christian beliefs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Circumcision_s_meaning_for_Christians_today.htm">What is the theological significance of circumcision in Genesis 17:11 for Christians today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/diligent_or_slothful_habits.htm">What is the significance of circumcision in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_bread_and_wine's_miracles_fit_science.htm">In Matthew 26:26&#8211;29, how can the supernatural implications of the bread and wine be reconciled with scientific understanding of physical substances?
