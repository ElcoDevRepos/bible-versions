The term "LORD God" combines the covenant name Yahweh with Elohim, highlighting both His personal and powerful nature. The act of taking the man suggests divine intention and purpose, indicating that humanity's existence and role are not accidental but part of God's sovereign plan. This reflects the intimate relationship between God and humanity, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4-6</a>, where man's place in creation is highlighted.<p><b>and placed him in the Garden of Eden</b><br>The Garden of Eden is depicted as a specific, divinely prepared location, symbolizing a place of provision and fellowship with God. Geographically, while the exact location is unknown, it is described in <a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10-14</a> as being near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, suggesting a location in the ancient Near East. Theologically, Eden represents an ideal state of harmony between God, humanity, and creation, a theme echoed in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-3</a>, where the new creation restores this harmony.<p><b>to cultivate and keep it</b><br>This phrase indicates humanity's role as stewards of creation. "Cultivate" implies active engagement and care for the land, while "keep" suggests protection and preservation. This stewardship reflects God's command in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> to "fill the earth and subdue it," highlighting humanity's responsibility to manage God's creation wisely. The role of stewardship is a recurring biblical theme, seen in parables like the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where faithful management of resources is rewarded. This also prefigures Christ, who perfectly fulfills the role of steward and caretaker of God's creation, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, where all things are created through and for Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the covenant name of God, emphasizing His personal and relational nature with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Adam, the first human created by God, representing humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>A paradise created by God, symbolizing a place of provision, beauty, and divine presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultivate_and_keep.htm">Cultivate and Keep</a></b><br>The tasks given to Adam, indicating stewardship and responsibility over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>God entrusts us with His creation, calling us to be responsible stewards of the environment and resources He provides.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/work_as_worship.htm">Work as Worship</a></b><br>Our daily tasks and vocations are opportunities to serve God and reflect His character, turning work into an act of worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_placement.htm">Divine Placement</a></b><br>Just as God placed Adam in the Garden, He places us in specific contexts and roles for His purposes, inviting us to seek His guidance in fulfilling our roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/partnership_with_god.htm">Partnership with God</a></b><br>We are invited to partner with God in His creative and redemptive work, aligning our efforts with His will and purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_and_protecting.htm">Guarding and Protecting</a></b><br>The call to "keep" the garden extends to protecting and nurturing our spiritual lives, relationships, and communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_2_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 2:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_15_Man_s_role_in_creation.htm">How does Genesis 2:15 illustrate God's purpose for man's role in creation?

Seeds must be sown and the cultivated plots kept in order; but all this really added to Adam's happiness, because the adamah, as yet uncursed, responded willingly to the husbandman's care. The other word, "to keep it," implies, however, some difficulty and danger. Though no unpropitious weather, nor blight nor mildew, spoiled the crop, yet apparently it had to be guarded against the incursion of wild animals and birds, and protected even against the violence of winds and the burning heat of the sun.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Having prepared the garden for man's reception, <span class="cmt_word">the Lord God took the man.</span> "Not physically lifting him up and putting him down in the garden, but simply exerting an influence upon him which induced him, in the exercise of his free agency, to go.
