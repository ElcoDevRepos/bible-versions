In the ancient Near Eastern context, dreams were often considered divine messages, and Joseph's dreams suggested a future where he would have authority over his family. This was culturally provocative, as the eldest son typically held the position of leadership. The brothers' question underscores their disbelief and resentment towards the idea of Joseph, the second youngest, assuming such a role. This foreshadows the eventual fulfillment of Joseph's dreams when he becomes a powerful leader in Egypt, as seen in <a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6-9</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Will you actually rule us?&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of the question emphasizes the incredulity and scorn of Joseph's brothers. The Hebrew word for "rule" here suggests dominion and governance, which was a direct challenge to the established family hierarchy. This phrase also prophetically points to Joseph's future role as a ruler in Egypt, where he would indeed have authority over his brothers during the famine. This scenario is a type of Christ, who was also rejected by His own (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>) but later exalted to a position of authority.<p><b>So they hated him even more because of his dream and his statements.</b><br>The brothers' hatred is intensified by Joseph's dreams and his willingness to share them. This animosity sets the stage for their later actions against him, including selling him into slavery. The dreams are a key element in God's providential plan, illustrating how God can use human sinfulness to achieve His purposes. This hatred and subsequent betrayal parallel the experience of Jesus, who was also despised and rejected by those He came to save (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The narrative highlights themes of envy, divine sovereignty, and redemption, which are central to the biblical story.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is the son of Jacob and Rachel.

The sheaves bowing clearly point to authority, and they hear it as Joseph announcing, &#8220;God is setting me above you.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Their words drip with sarcasm, yet unwittingly echo the blessing spoken to their father: &#8220;May peoples serve you&#8230; be lord over your brothers&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>).<p>&#8211; Already, God is sowing the seed of future deliverance: the very question they mock will be answered affirmatively when Joseph is placed second only to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-44</a>).<p>&#8211; The episode reminds us that God often reveals His plans long before they unfold (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will you actually rule us?</b><p>&#8211; The brothers double down, pressing Joseph to defend something he never claimed on his own initiative; he simply reported what God showed him.<p>&#8211; Their phrase &#8220;actually rule&#8221; hints at an enduring, day-to-day governance&#8212;precisely what comes to pass when &#8220;Joseph&#8217;s brothers came and bowed themselves before him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture delights in this kind of irony: the scoffers ultimately confirm God&#8217;s word (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>).<p>&#8211; For believers, the scene invites confidence that divine promises survive ridicule and delay (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they hated him even more</b><p>&#8211; Hatred has already been mentioned twice (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4-5</a>).
