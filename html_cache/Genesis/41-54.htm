The famine was a significant event, not only in Egypt but also in the surrounding regions, emphasizing the accuracy of Joseph's interpretation. The number seven is often symbolic in the Bible, representing completeness or divine perfection, as seen in the seven days of creation (Genesis 1). The famine's onset demonstrates God's sovereign control over nature and history, fulfilling His word precisely as revealed to Joseph.<p><b>just as Joseph had said</b><br>Joseph's accurate prediction underscores his role as a prophet and a wise leader, chosen by God to save many lives. His ability to interpret dreams was a gift from God, distinguishing him from the magicians and wise men of Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8, 16</a>). This phrase highlights Joseph's faithfulness and reliability, serving as a type of Christ, who also spoke truth and fulfilled God's promises (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). Joseph's rise from prisoner to prime minister prefigures Christ's exaltation from suffering servant to King of Kings (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-9</a>).<p><b>And although there was famine in every country</b><br>The widespread nature of the famine indicates a severe and extensive crisis, affecting not only Egypt but also the surrounding nations. This situation sets the stage for the movement of Jacob's family to Egypt, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The famine's reach demonstrates the interconnectedness of the ancient Near East, where trade and travel were common, and Egypt's strategic location made it a central hub.<p><b>there was food throughout the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase highlights the effectiveness of Joseph's administration and God's provision through him. By storing surplus grain during the seven years of plenty, Egypt became a place of refuge and sustenance during the famine. This provision is a testament to God's faithfulness and wisdom, as He prepared a way for His people to survive and thrive. Egypt's abundance during the famine foreshadows the spiritual sustenance found in Christ, the Bread of Life, who provides for all who come to Him (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt, and interpreted Pharaoh's dreams, predicting seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who appointed Joseph as second-in-command after Joseph interpreted his dreams.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph was brought as a slave and later became a powerful leader.

As, too, this dearth was "in all lands," in Arabia, Palestine, Ethiopia, &c., there was evidently a long period of excessive drought. Still Egypt is always liable to famine, and Bar Hebraeus (<span class= "ital">Chronicon, </span>p. 260) gives terrible details of the sufferings of Egypt in the year of the Hej'ra 462, when so great was the loss of life, that whereas in the city of Tanis (Zoan) 300,000 men paid poll-tax in the previous year, there remained in it less than a hundred souls at the end of the dearth.<p>One argument adduced by Canon Cook, <span class= "ital">Excursus on the Bearings of Egyptian History on the Pentateuch, </span>p. 451, for placing the descent of the Israelites into Egypt in the reign of Amenemha III., is that it was this monarch who "first established a complete system of dykes, canals, locks, and reservoirs, by which the inundations of the Nile were henceforth regulated." The artificial lake of Moeris was also made by his orders, and other works of extraordinary vastness. Now not only would such works be suggested by a dearth of unusually long continuance, but the measures taken by Joseph during the seven years of famine would place the whole resources of the country at the Pharaoh's disposal.<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/41-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of famine</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
