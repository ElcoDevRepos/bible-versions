In the context of Joseph's story, it marks the fulfillment of the dreams he interpreted. The number three frequently appears in Scripture, such as in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day, indicating a pattern of God's redemptive work.<p><b>which was Pharaoh&#8217;s birthday</b><br>Pharaoh's birthday was a significant event in ancient Egypt, often celebrated with great pomp and ceremony. Birthdays of rulers were occasions for public feasting and displays of power. This context highlights the cultural practices of the time and sets the stage for the events that follow. The mention of Pharaoh's birthday is unique in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of the occasion.<p><b>he held a feast for all his officials</b><br>Feasts were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, serving as opportunities for rulers to display wealth and reinforce social hierarchies. This feast would have been a grand affair, attended by high-ranking officials and courtiers. The gathering of officials underscores the public nature of the events that transpire, adding weight to the decisions made by Pharaoh.<p><b>and in their presence</b><br>The public setting of the feast indicates that the actions taken by Pharaoh were meant to be seen and understood by his court. This visibility underscores the authority of Pharaoh and the importance of the decisions regarding the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. It also reflects the transparency of justice in the royal court, where decisions were made in the presence of witnesses.<p><b>he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker</b><br>"Lifting up the heads" is a Hebrew idiom that can mean to restore to a position or to execute judgment. In this context, it signifies the outcome of the dreams Joseph interpreted: the restoration of the cupbearer and the execution of the baker. This phrase foreshadows the fulfillment of Joseph's interpretations, demonstrating his God-given ability to discern dreams. The contrasting fates of the two men also serve as a reminder of divine justice and the sovereignty of God in human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who is celebrating his birthday with a feast.
