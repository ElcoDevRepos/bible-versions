Biblically, daybreak often marks significant events, such as the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>) and Jacob's wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-31</a>).<p><b>the angels hurried Lot along</b><br>The presence of angels indicates divine involvement and protection. Angels often act as messengers or agents of God's will, as seen in other biblical accounts like the announcement to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>). The urgency reflects the imminent judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah, emphasizing God's mercy in providing a way of escape.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Get up!</b><br>The command "Get up!" is a call to action, reflecting the need for immediate obedience to divine instruction. This mirrors other biblical calls to action, such as Jesus telling the paralytic to "Get up, take your mat and walk" (<a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8</a>), highlighting faith and responsiveness to God's word.<p><b>Take your wife and your two daughters who are here</b><br>The instruction to take his family underscores the importance of familial responsibility and protection. Lot's family is given the opportunity for salvation, reminiscent of Noah's family being saved from the flood (<a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>). It also highlights the biblical theme of household salvation (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>).<p><b>or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.&#8221;</b><br>The warning of being "swept away" indicates the totality and severity of divine judgment. This echoes the destruction of the wicked in the flood (Genesis 6-7) and foreshadows future judgments, such as the final judgment described in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).
