In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, children, especially sons, were considered a blessing and a sign of God's favor. Leah's statement underscores her belief that God is actively involved in her personal circumstances. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God as the giver of life and blessings, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>, which describes children as a heritage from the Lord.<p><b>she said.</b><br>The use of direct speech here highlights Leah's personal experience and emotional state. It provides insight into her ongoing struggle for her husband's affection and societal status. This personal declaration is part of a larger narrative where Leah and her sister Rachel vie for Jacob's love and attention, reflecting the complex family dynamics and rivalries that characterize much of Genesis.<p><b>This time my husband will honor me,</b><br>Leah's hope for honor from Jacob indicates her ongoing desire for his love and respect. Despite bearing him multiple sons, Leah feels undervalued compared to Rachel, Jacob's favored wife. This reflects the cultural context where a woman's worth was often tied to her ability to produce male heirs. Leah's statement also echoes earlier sentiments in <a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32-34</a>, where she expresses similar hopes with the births of her previous sons.<p><b>because I have borne him six sons.</b><br>The number six is significant, as it represents completeness in some biblical contexts. Leah's six sons contribute to the formation of the twelve tribes of Israel, a foundational element in the history of the Israelites. This phrase also highlights the importance of lineage and inheritance in the ancient Near Eastern context, where sons were crucial for maintaining family legacy and property.<p><b>And she named him Zebulun.</b><br>The name Zebulun is derived from a Hebrew root meaning "to honor" or "to dwell," reflecting Leah's hope for her husband's honor and possibly a more permanent place in his affections. Zebulun later becomes one of the tribes of Israel, with its own territory in the Promised Land. This naming also connects to the broader biblical theme of names carrying prophetic or significant meanings, as seen with other patriarchal figures like Isaac and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is the mother of six of Jacob's sons.

As we trace Leah&#8217;s words through Scripture, we see a gracious God who hears, provides, and weaves individual lives into His redemptive story.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Zebulun.</span>--Leah is more than usually obscure in the reasons she gives for this name; for she plays upon two words, which probably both belonged to the Mesopotamian <span class= "ital">pato is: </span>and as this was a Syriac dialect, we must look to that language for their explanation. The first is <span class= "ital">zebed; </span>and here there is no difficulty. It means such presents as a father gives his daughter on her marriage, over and above those enumerated in the marriage contract. Of the second, <span class= "ital">zabal, </span>there is no trace. Nor do the Syro-Arabic lexicons acknowledge in the word "Zebulun" such a sense as that of <span class= "ital">dwelling, </span>given it in our margin. Bar-Ali explains it as meaning "salvation of the night, or a good dowry," and Bar- Bahlul, "a dowry of the night," both deriving it from <span class= "ital">zebed, </span>a dowry, and <span class= "ital">lun, </span>to pass the night. The derivation is wrong as far as concerns <span class= "ital">lun; </span>for the word Zebulun is formed simply from <span class= "ital">zebed, </span>the final <span class= "ital">d </span>of which is changed into I for mere reasons of euphony. The Versions take the word <span class= "ital">zabal </span>as mean ing, "to be with," Vulg.; "to choose," LXX.; "to cleave to," Syriac. It occurs nowhere else, but the substantive <span class= "ital">zebul </span>is not uncommon, and means <span class= "ital">dwelling, station.</span><p>As a woman's value in the East rises with each son, Leah now hoped for more love from her husband.
