This divine directive marks the beginning of Abraham's journey of faith and obedience. The departure from his father's house signifies a break from his past and a step into the unknown, relying solely on God's promises. This act of faith is later highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>, where Abraham's obedience is commended. The journey from his father's house also symbolizes a spiritual journey, leaving behind old ways and stepping into a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>I said to Sarah, &#8216;This is how you can show your loyalty to me:</b><br>Abraham's request to Sarah reflects the cultural norms and practices of the ancient Near East, where familial ties and loyalty were paramount. In this context, loyalty involves protecting one's family and ensuring their safety. Abraham's concern for his safety in foreign lands led him to devise a plan that he believed would protect them both. This request also underscores the patriarchal structure of the time, where wives were expected to support and follow their husbands' directives.<p><b>Wherever we go, say of me, &#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This strategy was employed by Abraham to protect himself from potential harm in foreign territories, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10-20</a> and later in <a href="/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7-11</a> with Isaac. The claim that Sarah was his sister was a half-truth, as she was his half-sister (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>). This tactic reflects the precarious nature of travel in ancient times, where strangers could be viewed with suspicion or hostility. The repetition of this strategy in different contexts highlights human tendencies to rely on self-devised plans rather than fully trusting in God's protection. It also foreshadows the ultimate need for divine intervention and grace, as seen in the resolution of these situations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who is speaking in this verse.

That decisive move was entirely God-initiated; Abraham obediently &#8220;went out, not knowing where he was going&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Already, the Lord had pledged to bless and protect him (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>). Every step after that call should have rested on divine safeguarding, yet Abraham&#8217;s later actions reveal the ongoing struggle between faith and fear.<p>&#8226; The wording &#8220;had me journey&#8221; underscores that Abraham viewed his life as directed by God&#8212;an important admission that makes his subsequent reliance on a human scheme stand out all the more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I said to Sarah</b><p>&#8226; Abraham speaks as head of the covenant household (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>). His words would set the tone for how the family faced danger.<p>&#8226; Sarah&#8217;s submission to this instruction is noted in <a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>, where she is commended for obeying Abraham and calling him lord, yet the New Testament also highlights her inner hope in God rather than the plan itself.<p>&#8226; Their marriage was meant to model trust in God&#8217;s promises, especially concerning the coming son (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>). When Abraham issued this directive, he inadvertently pulled the focus from God&#8217;s sufficiency to human caution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is how you can show your loyalty to me</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Loyalty&#8221; (or kindness) signals covenant faithfulness within the marriage. Abraham wanted Sarah to demonstrate steadfast love (compare <a href="/genesis/24-49.htm">Genesis 24:49</a>).<p>&#8226; His request, however, mixes devotion with compromise. Genuine loyalty should uphold truth (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>); here it involves a half-truth.<p>&#8226; Bullet points on what godly loyalty should entail:<p>&#8211; Trust in God&#8217;s word above human calculations (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; Protection that aligns with righteousness (<a href="/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Mutual commitment that strengthens both partners&#8217; faith (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s fear of foreign kings (<a href="/genesis/20-11.htm">Genesis 20:11</a>) nudged him to redefine loyalty as silent cooperation with deception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wherever we go, say of me, &#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The tactic was first used in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11&#8211;13</a>) and repeated here in Gerar (<a href="/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1&#8211;2</a>), then later mimicked by Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a>). Patterns of fear can become family habits when not addressed.<p>&#8226; It was a partial truth&#8212;Sarah was Abraham&#8217;s half-sister (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>)&#8212;yet still a misleading cover. Scripture treats half-truth as falsehood because it obscures reality (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Immediate consequences show God&#8217;s protective hand despite the scheme:<p>&#8211; The Lord intervened through a dream to warn Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8211; Sarah&#8217;s purity and the promised lineage were preserved, proving that God&#8217;s covenant does not rely on human subterfuge.<p>&#8226; Lessons that flow out:<p>&#8211; Fear of man &#8220;lays a snare&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>), while trusting the Lord brings safety.<p>&#8211; God can overrule our missteps to keep His redemptive plan intact (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8211; Repeating old compromises hampers witness to outsiders, yet God&#8217;s mercy remains steadfast (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/20-13.htm">Genesis 20:13</a> records Abraham explaining the origin of a long-standing survival strategy: he asked Sarah to present him as her brother whenever they entered foreign territory. The verse exposes the tension between God-given promises and human fear. Although Abraham acknowledged that God directed his journey, he still relied on a half-truth to protect himself. Scripture shows that genuine loyalty should reinforce faithfulness and truth, not undermine it. Even so, the narrative magnifies God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to safeguard His covenant purposes, preserving both Sarah and the future line of blessing despite Abraham&#8217;s flawed plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">When God caused me to wander.</span>--According to rule, Elohim is construed with a verb singular for the true God, but with a verb plural for false gods. Here the verb is plural, and the same construction occurs in <a href="/genesis/35-7.htm" title="And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.">Genesis 35:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-9.htm" title="For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double to his neighbor.">Exodus 22:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-22.htm" title="Why you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.">2Samuel 7:22</a> (but singular in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-20.htm" title="O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.">1Chronicles 17:20</a>); and <a href="/psalms/58-11.htm" title="So that a man shall say, Truly there is a reward for the righteous: truly he is a God that judges in the earth.">Psalm 58:11</a> : moreover, in <a href="/joshua/24-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.">Joshua 24:19</a>, Elohim is joined with an adjective (holy) in the plural. These exceptions may either be relics of a less strict use of the name Elohim, or they may be errors of copyists, misled by the ordinary rules of grammar. This latter view is confirmed by the fact that the Samaritan Pentateuch, both here and in <a href="/genesis/35-7.htm" title="And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.">Genesis 35:7</a>, has the singular. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander</span> (or to go on pilgrimages) <span class="cmt_word">from my father's house</span>, - Elohim, usually construed with a singular verb, is here joined with a verb in the plural, as an accommodation to the polytheistic stand-point of Abimelech (Keil), as a proof that Elohim is to be viewed as a <span class="accented">Pluralis Majes-taticus</span> (Kalisch), as referring to the plurality of Divine manifestations which Abraham had received (Lange), as showing that Elohim here signifies angels (Calvin), or, most likely, as an instance of the literal meaning of the term as the supernatural powers (Murphy.
