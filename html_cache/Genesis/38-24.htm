The three-month period is significant as it aligns with the time when pregnancy becomes noticeable. This timing is crucial in the narrative, as it sets the stage for the revelation of Tamar's condition and the subsequent confrontation.<p><b>Judah was told</b><br>Judah, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, is informed of Tamar's situation. This reflects the patriarchal society where men held authority and were often the first to receive important news. Judah's role as a leader in his family and community is highlighted here.<p><b>&#8220;Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself</b><br>The accusation against Tamar is severe, reflecting the cultural and legal standards of the time. In ancient Near Eastern societies, sexual immorality, especially for women, was met with harsh penalties. The term "prostituted" suggests a breach of social and familial expectations, as Tamar was expected to remain chaste while waiting for Judah's youngest son, Shelah.<p><b>and now she is pregnant.&#8221;</b><br>Tamar's pregnancy is the evidence of her alleged wrongdoing. In the context of the narrative, this pregnancy is pivotal, as it ultimately leads to the revelation of Judah's own actions. The pregnancy also serves as a turning point in the story, highlighting themes of justice and redemption.<p><b>&#8220;Bring her out!&#8221; Judah replied.</b><br>Judah's immediate reaction is one of judgment and authority. His command to bring Tamar out reflects the legal practices of the time, where the accused would be brought before the community for judgment. This response also underscores Judah's initial lack of awareness of his own culpability in the situation.<p><b>&#8220;Let her be burned to death!&#8221;</b><br>The punishment Judah calls for is severe, indicating the gravity of the perceived offense. Burning was a form of capital punishment reserved for the most serious transgressions, such as adultery or prostitution, according to some interpretations of Mosaic Law. This harsh sentence reflects the cultural and legal norms of the time, as well as Judah's initial self-righteousness. However, this moment also sets the stage for Judah's eventual recognition of his own sin and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Tamar's lineage, which ultimately leads to the birth of King David and, later, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a central figure in this account.

On this account, the Jewish expositors argue that Tamar belonged to a priestly family, and some even think that she was descended from Melchisedek.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it same to pass about three months after</span> (the usual time at which pregnancy is certainly determined), <span class="cmt_word">that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot</span> (or, acted as a <span class="accented">zonah</span>); <span class="cmt_word">and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said</span> (altogether unmindful of his own iniquity three months previous), <span class="cmt_word">Bring her forth, and let her be burnt</span>. Under the law stoning was the punishment allotted to the crime of Tamar (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-20.htm">Deuteronomy 22:20-24</a>), burning being added only in cases of excessive criminality (<a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>). It is obvious that the power of life and death lay in the hand of Judah, as the head of his family. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/38-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">About</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Preposition-m &#124; Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">months later,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1459;&#1491;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;o&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2320.htm">Strong's 2320: </a> </span><span class="str2">The new moon, a month</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was told,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1467;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yug&#183;ga&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hofal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Your daughter-in-law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1428;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(kal&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3618.htm">Strong's 3618: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daughter-in-law, bride</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Tamar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;m&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8559.htm">Strong's 8559: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tamar -- daughter-in-law of Judah, also two Israelite women, also a place South of the Dead Sea </span><br /><br /><span class="word">has prostituted herself,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1469;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2181.htm">Strong's 2181: </a> </span><span class="str2">To commit adultery, to commit idolatry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
