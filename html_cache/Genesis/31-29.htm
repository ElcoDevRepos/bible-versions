This reflects the patriarchal and tribal society of the time, where family heads wielded significant power. Laban's statement underscores the tension between him and Jacob, highlighting the potential for conflict. This power dynamic is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where individuals in authority have the capacity to harm, such as Pharaoh's power over the Israelites in Exodus.<p><b>but last night the God of your father said to me</b><br>The phrase indicates divine intervention. The "God of your father" refers to the God of Abraham and Isaac, emphasizing the covenantal relationship and continuity of God's promises. This divine encounter mirrors other instances where God communicates through dreams, such as with Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>. It also shows God's protective hand over Jacob, similar to how God protected Abraham and Isaac.<p><b>&#8216;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8217;</b><br>This command from God to Laban serves as a divine warning, ensuring Jacob's safety. The instruction to refrain from speaking "either good or bad" suggests that God is preventing any manipulation or influence over Jacob's decisions. This reflects God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen people, as seen throughout the biblical narrative. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of God's guidance and protection over believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the father-in-law of Jacob, who pursued Jacob after he fled with his family and possessions.

From a human standpoint, Jacob is vulnerable.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows that even when enemies seem strong, their power is limited by God&#8217;s sovereign hand (<a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>; <a href="/john/19-10.htm">John 19:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes Laban&#8217;s heart: he still views Jacob as property he can control, despite twenty years of service and God&#8217;s clear blessing on Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27-30</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the reminder is that apparent human power must always be measured against God&#8217;s ultimate authority (<a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but last night the God of your father said to me</b><p>&#8220;but last night the God of your father said to me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>)<p>&#8226; God personally intervenes by appearing to Laban in a dream, reinforcing His covenant commitment to Abraham, Isaac, and now Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>; 31:24).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;the God of your father&#8221; underscores continuity: the same God who watched over Isaac now guards Jacob. Laban is reminded that Jacob is under divine protection, not merely familial ties (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Dreams are one of the means God uses to communicate warnings to those outside the covenant line for the sake of His people (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3, 6</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s intended harm is halted not by moral conviction but by God&#8217;s direct command, showing how the Lord restrains evil for His purposes (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.</b><p>&#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>)<p>&#8226; The directive limits Laban&#8217;s speech and, by extension, his actions. God draws a clear boundary: no coercion, no threats, no empty promises.<p>&#8226; Similar language appears when God shields His servants: &#8220;Do not touch My anointed ones; do My prophets no harm&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14-15</a>) and when Balaam is told, &#8220;You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By forbidding Laban to speak &#8220;good or bad,&#8221; God removes any opportunity for manipulation&#8212;no flattering inducements to return, no intimidation to surrender (<a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2-3, 9</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows Jesus&#8217; defense of His disciples: &#8220;Let them go&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8</a>). God defends His chosen, sometimes by muzzling adversaries before they can act (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Laban boasts of the harm he could inflict, yet God&#8217;s overnight intervention strips that threat of all force. The verse showcases a timeless truth: human power is real but never ultimate; God sovereignly protects His covenant people, even constraining the words of their foes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">It is in the power of my hand.</span>--This is the rendering here of all the versions, and is confirmed by <a href="/deuteronomy/28-32.htm" title="Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in your hand.">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm" title="Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil on their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.">Micah 2:1</a>; but Keil and Knobel wish to translate, "My hand is for God." This comes to the same thing in an impious way, as the sense would be," My hand is an El, a god, for me," and enables me to do what I will.<p>The speech of Laban is half true and half false. He would have wished not to part with Jacob at all, but to have recovered from him as much as he could of his property. But if he was to go, he would have liked outward appearances maintained; and, probably, he had an affection for his daughters and their children, though not so strong as to counterbalance his selfishness. His character, like that of all men, is a mixture of good and evil.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have power to do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
