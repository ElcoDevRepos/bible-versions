Joseph, though not the firstborn, is elevated above his brothers, reflecting his favored position in the family. This favoritism is consistent with earlier narratives where Joseph receives the coat of many colors and is given leadership roles. This elevation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is also exalted above His brethren.<p><b>I give the ridge of land</b><br>The "ridge of land" refers to a specific portion of territory. This land is significant as it represents a tangible inheritance and blessing. In biblical times, land was a crucial aspect of God's promises to His people, symbolizing stability, provision, and divine favor. The land given to Joseph foreshadows the future inheritance of the Promised Land by the Israelites.<p><b>that I took from the Amorites</b><br>The Amorites were a prominent Canaanite people known for their fortified cities and military prowess. Jacob's reference to taking land from the Amorites may not be recorded elsewhere in Scripture, suggesting either a personal conquest or a prophetic statement about future victories by his descendants. This reflects the ongoing struggle for the Promised Land and God's promise to give it to Abraham's descendants.<p><b>with my sword and bow.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a personal effort and struggle in acquiring the land, symbolizing the active role Jacob played in securing his family's future. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people engaging in spiritual and physical battles to claim God's promises. The use of "sword and bow" can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual warfare believers face, paralleling the New Testament call to put on the full armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is nearing the end of his life and is blessing his sons.

&#8220;Amorites&#8221; can refer broadly to Canaanite peoples (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The family&#8217;s earlier conflict at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25&#8211;30</a>) resulted in possession of the area. Though Simeon and Levi led the assault, Jacob here counts the victory as his own&#8212;he was head of the household.<p>&#8226; By linking the ridge with conquest, Jacob reminds Joseph that Israel&#8217;s inheritance often comes through struggle (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with my sword and bow</b><p>The patriarch underscores that the land was won, not merely purchased:<p>&#8226; These words portray Jacob as a warrior-shepherd who defended his family (<a href="/genesis/31-38.htm">Genesis 31:38&#8211;41</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet later God will tell Israel, &#8220;It was not by your sword or bow&#8221; that you gained the land (<a href="/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>), balancing human effort with divine provision.<p>&#8226; The mention of weaponry foreshadows Israel&#8217;s future battles under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>), assuring Joseph that God-backed courage secures the promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> records Jacob&#8217;s distinctive bequest to Joseph: a ridge near Shechem, secured through conflict and now granted as an extra portion beyond what Joseph&#8217;s brothers will receive. By doing so, Jacob 1) highlights Joseph&#8217;s pre-eminence, 2) ties the family&#8217;s future to a specific piece of the promised land, and 3) illustrates how God&#8217;s covenant blessings can involve both divine promise and faithful human action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">One portion.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">one Shechem. </span>In favour of this being the town of Shechem is the fact that it did belong to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/37-12.htm" title="And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.">Genesis 37:12</a>, where see Note); also that Joseph's embalmed body was deposited there (see <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>, where the land is said to have been bought for a hundred kesitas); and, lastly, the testimony of <a href="/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>, where a parcel of ground at Sychar, close to Shechem, is identified with the ground given by Jacob to Joseph. On the other hand, <span class= "ital">one Shechem </span>is an unnatural way of describing a town. Shechem also means, as we have seen (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>), the <span class= "ital">shoulder, </span>and Abul-walid, in his Lexicon, quoting this place, says that both the Hebrews and Arabs gave this name to any elevated strip of ground. This is confirmed by <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm" title="And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:">Numbers 34:11</a>, &c., though the word actually used, <span class= "ital">chatef, </span>is different. Probably, therefore, there was a play upon words in calling this plot of hill-ground Shechem, and not <span class= "ital">chatef</span>', but made with the intention of showing that the town of Shechem was the portion really signified. But what is meant by "Jacob having taken it out of the hand of the Amorite by his sword and his bow"? Shechem was strictly a town of the Hivites, but as they were but a feeble tribe, the term Amorite may be used to give greater glory to the exploit. In <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>, the Amorites, literally <span class= "ital">mountaineers, </span>are described as owners of the whole country, and probably it was a term loosely applied to all the inhabitants of the uplands, though occasionally used with a more definite meaning (<a href="/genesis/15-21.htm" title="And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.">Genesis 15:21</a>). As Jacob so strongly condemns the conduct of Simeon and Levi (<a href="/context/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.">Genesis 49:5-7</a>), he can scarcely refer to their exploit, and therefore commentators generally suppose that he used the words prophetically, meaning, "which my descendants will, centuries hence, conquer for themselves with their swords and bows." But this is, to take the words of Holy Scripture in a non-natural sense. Jacob was the owner of a strip of this "shoulder-land" in a way in which he was not the owner of any other portion of land in Canaan, except the cave of Machpelah; and we find him sending his cattle to pasture there when he was himself dwelling far away (<a href="/genesis/37-12.htm" title="And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.">Genesis 37:12</a>). And it is quite possible that, after the inhuman treatment of the Hivites at Shechem, the Amorites did gather themselves together to avenge the Wrong, but were deterred by the threatening position taken up by Jacob, or even repulsed in an attack. The latter supposition would best harmonise with the fact that "a mighty terror fell upon all the cities round about" (<a href="/genesis/35-5.htm" title="And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.">Genesis 35:5</a>), and also with the exultant spirit in which Jacob, a pre-eminently peaceful and timid man, here alludes to the one military exploit of his life. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">I have given</span> - or, I give (Keil), I will give (Kalisch), the preterit being used prophetically as a future, or even as a present, the event being regarded, from its certainty, as already accomplished. It is thus not absolutely clear that Jacob here alludes to any past transaction in his own personal history - <span class="cmt_word">to thee one portion</span> - literally, one <span class="accented">shoulder</span>, or ridge, or elevated tract of land, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>; <span class="accented">unam pattern</span> (Vulgate), with which agree several of the ancient versions (Onkelos, Syriac) - <span class="cmt_word">above thy brethren, which I took</span> - or take (Keil), or shall take (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">out of the hand of the Amorite</span> - a general name for the inhabitants of Canaan (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 15:16) - <span class="cmt_word">with my sword and with my bow.</span> As Scripture has preserved no account of any military exploit in the history of Jacob such as is here described, the patriarch's language has been understood as referring to the plot of ground at Shechem which Jacob purchased of Hamor the father of Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>), and as signifying either that he had captured it by sword and bow, in the sense that his sons at the head of his armed retainers had put the inhabitants of the town to the sword, and so taken possession of the entire district (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy); or that, though he had peacefully paid for it, he yet required at a subsequent period to recover it by force of arms from the Canaanites (Lawson, Bush, Wordsworth); or that after the terrible tragedy at Shechem, when God put a fear upon the surrounding cities, Jacob and his sons stood in the gate of Shechem in the armed expectation of a hostile attack, and so may be said to have taken it by sword and bow (Rabbi Solomon, Lyra, Willet). It seems, however, better to regard the words as a prophetic utterance pointing forward to the conquest of Canaan, which Jacob here represents himself, in the persons of his descendants, as taking from the Amorites by means of sword and bow, and as intimating that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would receive a double portion of the inheritance, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> being probably designed to convey a hint that the tract to be in future assigned to Joseph's descendants would be the region round about the ancient city Shechem (Ainsworth, Keil, Kalisch, Lunge, etc.). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/48-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And to you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1435;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
