Ishmael, like Esau, was a firstborn who did not receive the covenant blessing. This action may indicate Esau's desire to gain favor or legitimacy by marrying within the broader Abrahamic family, despite his previous marriages displeasing his parents (<a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34-35</a>).<p><b>and married Mahalath</b><br>Mahalath, whose name means "stringed instrument" or "lyre," becomes Esau's wife. This marriage is significant as it represents Esau's continued departure from the covenantal line. Unlike Jacob, who was sent to marry within the family of Laban, Esau's choice reflects a lack of concern for the covenant promises associated with his grandfather Abraham.<p><b>the sister of Nebaioth</b><br>Nebaioth is the firstborn son of Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>). Mentioning Nebaioth highlights the connection to Ishmael's lineage, which was significant in the context of tribal and familial alliances. This connection to Nebaioth may have been seen as a strategic alliance, though it was outside the covenant line.<p><b>and daughter of Abraham&#8217;s son Ishmael</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the familial connection to Abraham, though through Ishmael, who was not the child of promise. Ishmael's descendants were blessed by God to become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>), but they were distinct from the line through Isaac, which carried the covenant promises.<p><b>in addition to the wives he already had</b><br>Esau's polygamy contrasts with the monogamous marriages of the patriarchs like Isaac and Jacob, highlighting a departure from the covenantal norms. His existing marriages to Hittite women had already caused grief to Isaac and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34-35</a>), and this additional marriage further illustrates Esau's disregard for the spiritual and familial values of his parents.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, twin brother of Jacob.

Yet by turning to Ishmael&#8217;s line and merely adding another wife, Esau chooses human fixes over heartfelt repentance.
