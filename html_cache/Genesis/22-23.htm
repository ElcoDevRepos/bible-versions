This connection is crucial for the continuation of the Abrahamic covenant through Isaac's lineage. Rebekah's introduction here foreshadows her role in the narrative of <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>, where she is chosen as Isaac's wife, ensuring the covenantal promises continue. The name Bethuel means "man of God," indicating a possible reverence or connection to the divine, which is fitting given his daughter's future role in the biblical narrative. Rebekah's introduction also sets the stage for the birth of Jacob and Esau, furthering the lineage that leads to the twelve tribes of Israel.<p><b>Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham&#8217;s brother Nahor.</b><br>Milcah, Nahor's wife, is mentioned as the mother of eight sons, highlighting the expansion of Nahor's family. This detail emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations, as Nahor's descendants are part of this broader narrative. Nahor, Abraham's brother, represents a parallel line to Abraham's, showing the spread of the family and the potential for alliances and interactions between their descendants. The mention of eight sons signifies a complete and prosperous family, which was a sign of blessing and favor in the ancient Near Eastern context. This genealogical detail also serves to connect Rebekah to the broader family of Abraham, reinforcing the theme of God's providence and the interconnectedness of the patriarchal narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethuel.htm">Bethuel</a></b><br>The son of Nahor and Milcah, and the father of Rebekah.
