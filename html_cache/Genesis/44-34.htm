In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the eldest son often bore the responsibility for the well-being of the family. Judah, though not the eldest, steps into this role, showing a transformation from his earlier actions in Genesis. This moment is pivotal, as it demonstrates Judah's repentance and growth, contrasting with his earlier decision to sell Joseph into slavery. The "boy" refers to Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob, who is deeply loved by their father. This love is reminiscent of Jacob's love for Joseph, highlighting the theme of favoritism and its consequences within the family.<p><b>I could not bear to see the misery that would overwhelm him.</b><br>Judah's concern for his father's emotional state underscores the importance of family honor and the well-being of the patriarch in ancient Near Eastern culture. The word "misery" indicates the profound grief Jacob would experience, reminiscent of his mourning for Joseph, whom he believed to be dead. This phrase also foreshadows the reconciliation and restoration of the family, a theme prevalent throughout the narrative. Judah's willingness to sacrifice himself for Benjamin is a type of Christ, prefiguring Jesus' sacrificial love and intercession for humanity. This act of selflessness is a turning point in the story, leading to the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity and the healing of familial rifts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of Jacob's twelve sons, who emerges as a leader among his brothers.
