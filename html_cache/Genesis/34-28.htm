In ancient Near Eastern culture, livestock such as flocks, herds, and donkeys were considered valuable assets, representing wealth and economic stability. The taking of these animals signifies a significant loss for the people of Shechem and a transfer of wealth to Jacob's family. This act of taking livestock is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where livestock is a sign of God's blessing or judgment, such as in the story of Job or the plagues of Egypt.<p><b>and everything else in the city or in the field</b><br>The phrase "everything else" suggests a thorough and indiscriminate looting of Shechem, extending beyond livestock to include all possessions and resources. This reflects the totality of the sons' retribution following the defilement of their sister Dinah. The mention of both "city" and "field" underscores the comprehensive nature of the plunder, affecting both urban and rural areas. This act of taking spoils is consistent with ancient practices of warfare and conquest, where victors would seize goods and resources from the defeated. Theologically, this event foreshadows the Israelites' later conquests in Canaan, where they are commanded to take possession of the land and its resources as part of God's promise to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon_and_levi.htm">Simeon and Levi</a></b><br>Sons of Jacob who led the attack on Shechem in response to the defilement of their sister, Dinah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A city in the land of Canaan where the events of <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a> take place.

Simeon and Levi did not merely claim reparations; they seized them. Scripture often records the victors &#8220;taking&#8221; spoils after conflict (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-14.htm">Deuteronomy 20:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>). Here, the word underscores personal vengeance masquerading as justice. While the brothers felt justified because of Shechem&#8217;s sin against Dinah, Jacob later labeled their anger &#8220;cursed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). The verse therefore sets the scene for an act that is both literally plunder and morally troubling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their flocks</b><p>Flocks&#8212;primarily sheep and goats&#8212;were a family&#8217;s movable bank account (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). By confiscating Shechem&#8217;s flocks, the brothers struck at the economic heart of the community. Earlier, Jacob himself had amassed wealth through flocks (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>). The irony is stark: the very means God used to bless Jacob now becomes the instrument his sons use to avenge dishonor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and herds</b><p>Herds refer mainly to cattle. Cattle supplied milk, meat, leather, and labor (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>). Removing the herds crippled the city&#8217;s long-term livelihood. In battles Israel later fought, the Lord sometimes permitted seizing herds (<a href="/numbers/31-9.htm">Numbers 31:9</a>), but that was under divine command. <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a> records no such directive, highlighting that the brothers acted on their own impulses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and donkeys</b><p>Donkeys were the pickup trucks of the ancient world&#8212;carriers of freight and riders of merchants (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>). By capturing them, the brothers halted trade and transport, paralyzing the region. Contrast this with the merciful provision in <a href="/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>, where a firstborn donkey could be redeemed; here, no redemption is offered&#8212;only raw confiscation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and everything else in the city</b><p>The phrase shows sweeping completeness, echoing later total-war language (&#8220;they devoted the city to destruction,&#8221; <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>). In <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>, however, the brothers stop short of total annihilation; they spare property for personal gain. Their selectivity&#8212;killing men but profiting from goods&#8212;reveals mixed motives of revenge and greed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or in the field</b><p>The plunder extended beyond city walls into the surrounding farmland. Nothing escaped (<a href="/1_samuel/30-20.htm">1 Samuel 30:20</a>). This clause emphasizes that the brothers&#8217; wrath was not momentary but methodical, reaching from urban centers to rural pastures. Complete removal left the survivors destitute, magnifying the consequence of unchecked anger (<a href="/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-28.htm">Genesis 34:28</a> describes a literal, comprehensive plundering: Simeon and Levi seized every form of wealth&#8212;flocks, cattle, donkeys, urban possessions, and rural assets. The verse records their thoroughness, revealing both the depth of their outrage over Dinah&#8217;s violation and the extent of their self-serving retaliation. While God later weaves even human anger into His redemptive plan, the text stands as a sober warning: zeal unrestrained by divine command can devastate entire communities and stain a family&#8217;s legacy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1469;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their flocks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;&#183;n&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
