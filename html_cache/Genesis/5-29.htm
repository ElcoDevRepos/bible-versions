This naming reflects the hope and expectation that Noah would bring relief to humanity. In the genealogical context of Genesis, names often carry prophetic significance, indicating the role or destiny of the individual. Noah's name foreshadows his future role in God's plan to preserve humanity through the flood.<p><b>saying, &#8220;May this one comfort us</b><br>The anticipation of comfort suggests a longing for relief from the hardships experienced since the fall of man. This phrase indicates a prophetic hope that Noah would be instrumental in alleviating the burdens brought about by sin. The concept of comfort here is not merely emotional but also practical, as Noah's life and actions would lead to a new beginning for humanity.<p><b>in the labor and toil of our hands</b><br>This phrase echoes the curse pronounced upon Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where God declared that the ground would produce thorns and thistles, and man would eat by the sweat of his brow. The labor and toil represent the daily struggles and hardships faced by humanity as a result of sin. Noah's birth is seen as a potential turning point in this ongoing struggle.<p><b>caused by the ground that the LORD has cursed.&#8221;</b><br>The curse on the ground is a direct consequence of Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. This curse is a reminder of the broken relationship between humanity and God, as well as the resulting impact on creation. The hope expressed in Noah's naming is that he would somehow mitigate the effects of this curse. This foreshadows the eventual redemption and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who is seen as the ultimate source of comfort and rest for humanity, reversing the curse through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lamech.htm">Lamech</a></b><br>The father of Noah, who named his son with a prophetic hope for relief from the curse on the ground.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The son of Lamech, whose name means "rest" or "comfort" in Hebrew, signifying his future role in God's plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who pronounced the curse on the ground due to Adam's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ground.htm">The Ground</a></b><br>Cursed by God as a result of Adam's disobedience, leading to toil and hardship for humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_curse.htm">The Curse</a></b><br>The consequence of sin that brought hardship and labor to mankind, as described in <a href="/bsb/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hope_of_redemption.htm">The Hope of Redemption</a></b><br>Lamech's naming of Noah reflects a deep-seated hope for relief from the curse, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_sin.htm">The Impact of Sin</a></b><br>The curse on the ground serves as a reminder of the pervasive impact of sin and the need for divine intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>Despite the curse, God had a plan for redemption through Noah, illustrating His sovereignty and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith.htm">The Role of Faith</a></b><br>Lamech's prophetic naming of Noah demonstrates faith in God's promises, encouraging believers to trust in God's future deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_comfort.htm">The Promise of Comfort</a></b><br>Noah's name signifies comfort, reminding us that God provides solace and hope even amidst life's hardships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_5_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 5:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_5_29_Noah_s_name_significance.htm">How does Genesis 5:29 highlight the significance of Noah's name and mission?

Lamech&#8217;s prophecy proved partially true as Noah preserved humanity through the flood and witnessed God&#8217;s pledge concerning the ground. The verse points forward to a widening pattern: God raises a person to comfort His people, culminating in Christ, who removes the curse entirely. Thus, this single sentence in the genealogy of Genesis shines as a beacon of assurance that God sees our toil and has planned our rest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">He called his name Noah.</span>--This is the first recorded instance, since the days of Eve, of a child being named at his birth, and in both cases the name ended in disappointment. Noah brought no rest, but in his days came the flood to punish human sin. We have already noticed that this longing of Lamech for comfort is in strong contrast with the arrogance of his namesake of the race of Cain. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/4-18.htm" title="And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.">Genesis 4:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">This same shall comfort us . . . of our hands.</span>--These words form a couplet in the Hebrew, and rhyme like the Arabic couplets in the Koran.<p><span class= "bld">The ground (adamah)</span> <span class= "bld">which the Lord hath cursed.</span>--It is usual to style this section Elohistic, because it so evidently takes up the narrative at <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm" title="And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.">Genesis 2:3</a>. Yet, first, the writer distinctly refers to <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17</a>, where it is Jehovah-Elohim who curses the ground; and next he uses the name Jehovah as equivalent to God, according to what we are told in <a href="/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>. Here, then, as in several other places, the idea that Genesis can be arranged in two portions, distinguished as Elohistic or Jehovistic, according to the name of God employed in them, entirely breaks down.
