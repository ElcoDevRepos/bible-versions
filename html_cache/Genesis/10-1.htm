The term "account" suggests a detailed record, which is a common feature in Genesis, as seen in the genealogies of Adam and others. This genealogy serves as a bridge between the antediluvian world and the post-flood era, highlighting the continuity of God's plan through human history.<p><b>Shem, Ham, and Japheth</b><br>These are the three sons of Noah, each representing different branches of humanity. Shem is traditionally associated with the Semitic peoples, including the Israelites, and is often linked to the line through which Abraham and ultimately Jesus Christ would come. Ham is associated with the Hamitic peoples, traditionally linked to Africa and parts of the Near East. Japheth is connected with the Indo-European peoples. The order of names may reflect their significance in the biblical narrative rather than their birth order.<p><b>who also had sons after the flood</b><br>This phrase indicates the repopulation of the earth following the flood, fulfilling God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). The mention of sons highlights the patriarchal structure of ancient societies, where lineage and inheritance were traced through male descendants. This repopulation sets the stage for the development of nations and languages, as detailed in the subsequent verses and chapters, leading to the Tower of Babel narrative in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.
