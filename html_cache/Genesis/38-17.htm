This reflects the agrarian society where livestock was a primary measure of wealth. Judah's offer indicates a customary practice of bartering and the importance of livestock in daily life. The mention of a goat also connects to other biblical narratives, such as the scapegoat in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, symbolizing atonement and sacrifice. Judah's willingness to send a goat highlights his intent to fulfill his promise, albeit in a morally questionable situation.<p><b>But she replied, "Only if you leave me something as a pledge until you send it."</b><br>The request for a pledge, or security, was a common practice to ensure the fulfillment of an agreement. In this context, Tamar's demand for a pledge underscores her awareness of the potential for deceit or non-fulfillment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of trust and the importance of keeping one's word, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>, which warns against rash pledges. The concept of a pledge also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of the Holy Spirit as a pledge or guarantee of our inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>). Tamar's insistence on a pledge reveals her strategic thinking and determination to secure her rights within the family lineage, which is crucial for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through the line of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The fourth son of Jacob and Leah, Judah is a central figure in this account.

A young goat was standard barter currency (cf. <a href="/genesis/32-14.htm">Genesis 32:14&#8211;15</a>, where Jacob assembles goats for Esau).<p>&#8226; Goats in the patriarchal age symbolized value and abundance; Judah&#8217;s promise signals that he takes Tamar&#8217;s demand seriously.<p>&#8226; The offer is immediate and tangible, yet still future-oriented&#8212;it must be delivered later, underscoring the need for trust.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses livestock as peace-offerings or restitution (<a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>). Here Judah believes a single goat will satisfy the arranged price.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judah answered.</b><p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s spoken word carries covenant weight. In their culture, a verbal promise bound the speaker (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p>&#8226; His readiness shows confidence but also a rashness that has already marked Judah&#8217;s life (<a href="/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26-27</a>; 38:1-11).<p>&#8226; By answering, he sets a moral expectation on himself: failure to send the goat will reveal deceit (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But she replied,</b><p>&#8226; Tamar immediately tests Judah&#8217;s integrity. Her response reveals foresight; she understands human unreliability (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This pivot in the dialogue shows Tamar moving from passive widow to active agent, a theme that ultimately exposes Judah&#8217;s sin and preserves the Messianic line (<a href="/genesis/38-26.htm">Genesis 38:26</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast Judah&#8217;s spontaneous offer with Tamar&#8217;s deliberate caution&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>, &#8220;The prudent see danger and take cover.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Only if you leave me something as a pledge until you send it.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; A pledge (security, collateral) safeguarded against broken promises (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Tamar requests items that can unmistakably identify Judah (<a href="/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>). By doing so she ensures justice in a culture where a woman&#8217;s testimony often lacked weight.<p>&#8226; The scene parallels God&#8217;s own covenants: He, too, provides a pledge&#8212;the Holy Spirit&#8212;as a guarantee of future fulfillment (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, Tamar&#8217;s insistence on a pledge highlights the biblical principle that faith and accountability walk together (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17</a> records a literal transaction that exposes character. Judah&#8217;s quick promise of a goat seems generous, yet Tamar wisely demands collateral, revealing Judah&#8217;s vulnerability and ensuring eventual justice. The goat points to customary payment; the pledge spotlights covenant faithfulness. Together they foreshadow God&#8217;s own pattern: an offered sacrifice accompanied by a guaranteed promise, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock</span> - literally, <span class="accented">a kid of the goats</span> (ver. 20;
