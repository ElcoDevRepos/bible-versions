The cultivation of vineyards and the production of wine were common practices in ancient Near Eastern cultures, indicating Noah's return to agricultural life. Wine in the Bible often symbolizes joy and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), but it also serves as a warning against excess (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). This incident marks the first mention of drunkenness in Scripture, illustrating the potential for misuse of God's gifts.<p><b>he became drunk</b><br>Noah's drunkenness is a significant moment, as it shows the vulnerability of even the most righteous individuals to sin. This event serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of overindulgence and losing self-control, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). It also foreshadows the moral failures of humanity post-flood, despite God's covenant with Noah.<p><b>and uncovered himself</b><br>The act of uncovering oneself is often associated with shame and dishonor in biblical texts. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, nakedness was considered a state of vulnerability and disgrace (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>). This incident with Noah parallels the shame experienced by Adam and Eve after the fall, highlighting the ongoing struggle with sin and the need for redemption.<p><b>inside his tent</b><br>The setting of this event within Noah's tent suggests a private matter that becomes public due to the actions of his son Ham. Tents were the primary dwellings of nomadic peoples, providing shelter and privacy. The breach of privacy by Ham, who later sees his father's nakedness, sets the stage for the subsequent curse on Canaan. This incident underscores the importance of respecting family boundaries and the consequences of failing to do so.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.

The verse now zooms in on a particular moment from that new beginning.<p>- Wine itself is God-given and can gladden the heart (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>), yet from the first sentence we sense a turning point: Noah moves from cultivation to consumption.<p>- Scripture often contrasts the blessing of wine with the danger of excess (<a href="/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The wording alerts us that what was meant for refreshment is about to become a stumbling block.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He became drunk</b><p>- The next clause states the consequence plainly: Noah lost self-control. Throughout the Bible, drunkenness is treated as folly and sin (<a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p>- Note the progression&#8212;drinking &#8594; drunkenness.

First Corinthians 10:12 warns, &#8220;Let him who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And uncovered himself</b><p>- The shame of nakedness first appeared after the fall (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>). Sin separates and exposes.<p>- Drunkenness impairs judgment, leading Noah to do what he would never have done sober (<a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly links inappropriate exposure with dishonor (<a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6-7</a>). For the patriarch, this act becomes the catalyst for the family drama that follows in <a href="/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22-27</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Inside his tent</b><p>- Though out of public view, sin&#8217;s impact is never isolated.

A God-given gift&#8212;wine&#8212;used without restraint leads Noah into drunkenness, shameful exposure, and family conflict. The verse stands as a timeless caution: honor God with every gift, guard your heart, and remember that even the faithful stumble when self-control is surrendered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">He was uncovered</span> is, literally, <span class= "ital">he uncovered himself. </span>It was no accident, but a wilful breach of modesty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he drank of the wine</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>; "perhaps so called from bubbling up and fermenting;" connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (Gesenius). Though the first mention of wine in Scripture, it is scarcely probable that the natural process of fermentation for so many centuries escaped the notice of the enterprising Cainites, or even of the Sethites; that, "though grapes had been in use before this, wine had not been extracted from them" (Murphy); or that Noah was unacquainted with the nature and effects of this intoxicating liquor (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Keil, Lunge). The article before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> indicates that the patriarch was "familiar with the use and treatment" of the grape (Kalisch); and Moses does not say this was the first occasion on which the patriarch tasted the fermented liquor (Calvin, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And was drunken</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (whence <span class="accented">shechar</span>, strong drink, <a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>), to drink to the full, very often signifies to make oneself drunken, or simply to be intoxicated as the result of drinking; and that which the Holy Spirit here reprobates is not the partaking of the fruit of the vine, but the drinking so as to be intoxicated thereby. Since the sin of Noah cannot be ascribed to ignorance, it is perhaps right, as well as charitable, to attribute it to ago and inadvertence. Six hundred years old at the time of the Flood, he must have been considerably beyond this when Ham saw him overtaken in his fault, since Canaan was Ham's fourth son (<a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>), and the first was not born till after the exit from the ark (<a href="/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>). But from whatever cause induced, the drunkenness of Noah was not entirely guiltless; it was sinful in itself, and led to further shame. <span class="cmt_word">And he was uncovered</span>.
