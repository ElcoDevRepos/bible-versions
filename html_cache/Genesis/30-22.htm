The concept of God "remembering" is a recurring theme in the Bible, often indicating a divine action following a period of waiting or suffering. In <a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>, God "remembered" Noah, leading to the receding of the floodwaters. Similarly, in <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>, God "remembered" His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, leading to the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt. Rachel's barrenness was a significant source of distress, as bearing children was crucial for a woman's status and security in ancient Near Eastern culture. God's remembrance here is an act of grace and fulfillment of His promises, reflecting His faithfulness and compassion.<p><b>He listened to her</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of prayer and God's responsiveness to human petitions. Rachel's plea for children is a central theme in her narrative, and this moment marks the divine response to her cries. The Bible frequently emphasizes God's attentiveness to the prayers of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states, "The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are attentive to their cry." Rachel's experience is a testament to the power of persistent prayer and God's willingness to intervene in the lives of those who seek Him earnestly.<p><b>and opened her womb,</b><br>The opening of Rachel's womb is a direct act of God, highlighting His sovereignty over life and fertility. In the biblical context, fertility was often seen as a blessing from God, while barrenness was viewed as a misfortune or even a curse. The opening of the womb is a motif found throughout Scripture, as seen in the stories of Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>), Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>), and Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-24.htm">Luke 1:24-25</a>). Each of these women experienced divine intervention that led to the birth of significant figures in biblical history. Rachel's son, Joseph, would go on to play a crucial role in the history of Israel, serving as a type of Christ in his suffering, exaltation, and role as a savior of his people. This phrase emphasizes God's control over human circumstances and His ability to bring about His purposes through miraculous means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who had been barren for many years.

The verse assures believers that the Lord&#8217;s timing is perfect, His remembrance is covenantal, His ear is attentive, and His power over life is absolute.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22-24) <span class= "bld">God remembered Rachel.</span>--Rachel's long barrenness had probably humbled and disciplined her; and, cured of her former petulance, she trusts no longer to "love-apples," but looks to God for the great blessing of children. He hearkens to her prayer, and remembers her. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm" title="And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.">1Samuel 1:19</a>.) In calling his name Joseph, there is again a play upon two words, for it may be formed from the verb used in <a href="/genesis/30-23.htm" title="And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:">Genesis 30:23</a>, and would then mean <span class= "ital">he takes away; </span>or it may signify <span class= "ital">he adds, </span>which is the meaning made prominent by Rachel. And God did add to her another son, but the boon cost her her life. As Joseph was born six or seven years before Jacob left Padan-aram, Rachel had been barren for twenty-six years. We must add that in her joy at Joseph's birth there is no trace of the ungenerous triumph over Leah so marked in her rejoicing at the birth of the sons of Bilhah; and in her trust that "Jehovah would add to her another son," she evidently had in mind the covenant promises, which a son of her own womb might now inherit. As a matter of fact, the long struggle for supremacy lay between the houses of Joseph and Judah; and Judah finally prevailed.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God remembered Rachel</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and God hearkened to her</span>, - as to Leah (ver. 17) - <span class="cmt_word">and opened her womb</span> - as he had previously done to Leah (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>).
