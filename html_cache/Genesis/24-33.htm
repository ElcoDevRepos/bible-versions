This act of setting a meal before a guest was a gesture of welcome and respect. The man referred to here is Abraham's servant, likely Eliezer, who was sent to find a wife for Isaac. The preparation of a meal indicates the host's willingness to engage in a relationship and dialogue, reflecting the cultural importance of hospitality as seen in other biblical accounts, such as Abraham's own hospitality to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>.<p><b>but he said, &#8220;I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.&#8221;</b><br>The servant's refusal to eat before speaking demonstrates his commitment to his mission and his sense of urgency. This reflects a prioritization of duty over personal comfort, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Jesus emphasizes the importance of spiritual duties over physical needs (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>). The servant's focus on his task also highlights the seriousness of his mission, which is to secure a wife for Isaac, ensuring the continuation of God's covenant with Abraham.<p><b>So Laban said, &#8220;Please speak.&#8221;</b><br>Laban's response indicates his willingness to listen and engage with the servant's message. This openness is crucial for the unfolding of God's plan, as Laban's agreement would lead to Rebekah becoming Isaac's wife. Laban's character is complex, as seen in later chapters, but here he is portrayed as hospitable and accommodating. This interaction sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, as Rebekah's marriage to Isaac is a key event in the lineage leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, traditionally believed to be Eliezer, is on a mission to find a wife for Isaac, Abraham's son.

Aware of this feeling, Abraham's servant will not partake of Laban's bread and salt until he has told his request.
