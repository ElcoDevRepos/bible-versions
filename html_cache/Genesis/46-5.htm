It represents a place of covenant and divine encounters (<a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31-33, 26</a>:23-25). Jacob's departure from Beersheba marks a pivotal moment in his life, as he leaves the Promised Land to go to Egypt. This move is significant in the unfolding of God's plan for Israel, as it sets the stage for the eventual enslavement and exodus of the Israelites, fulfilling God's earlier prophecy to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p><b>and the sons of Israel took their father Jacob</b><br>The phrase "sons of Israel" refers to Jacob's twelve sons, who are the progenitors of the twelve tribes of Israel. This highlights the unity and collective action of the family in this momentous journey. It also underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to make Jacob's descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). The involvement of all the sons signifies the importance of family and the continuation of the covenantal promise through them.<p><b>in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him</b><br>The wagons sent by Pharaoh symbolize the favor and provision of God through the ruler of Egypt. This act of kindness from Pharaoh reflects Joseph's high standing in Egypt and God's providential care for Jacob and his family. The use of wagons, a luxury at the time, indicates the honor and respect afforded to Jacob, and it also foreshadows the future relationship between Israel and Egypt, which will eventually lead to the Israelites' enslavement and deliverance.<p><b>along with their children and wives</b><br>The inclusion of children and wives emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the migration. It was not just Jacob and his sons, but the entire family unit that moved to Egypt. This reflects the importance of family continuity and the preservation of the covenant community. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to multiply Jacob's descendants, as the family grows and moves together. This movement of the entire family unit is a precursor to the larger narrative of the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt and their eventual exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the patriarch of the Israelites.

Jacob&#8217;s move signals a fresh act of faith, trusting God&#8217;s promise to make him a great nation in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God had just spoken to Jacob in visions of the night, reassuring him not to fear the journey (<a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2&#8211;4</a>).
