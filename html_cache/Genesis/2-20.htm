Naming in the ancient Near Eastern context signifies dominion and understanding. By naming the animals, Adam exercises his God-given role as steward of the earth (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). This act of naming also reflects the order and structure God intended for creation, as Adam discerns and categorizes the creatures. The mention of "livestock," "birds of the air," and "beasts of the field" encompasses the breadth of animal life, indicating the comprehensive nature of Adam's task. This mirrors the creation account where God categorizes the elements of the world (Genesis 1). The act of naming also foreshadows the importance of names throughout Scripture, where names often reveal character or destiny (e.g., Abram to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>).<p><b>But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of companionship and the need for a partner that corresponds to Adam. The term "suitable helper" (Hebrew: ezer kenegdo) implies a partner who is both complementary and equal, not inferior. This sets the stage for the creation of Eve, highlighting the relational aspect of humanity that reflects the relational nature of the Trinity. The absence of a suitable helper among the animals underscores the uniqueness of human relationships and the special creation of woman. This also prefigures the unity and partnership seen in the marriage relationship, as later described in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>, which is a type of the relationship between Christ and the Church. The search for a helper emphasizes the importance of community and relationship, foundational themes throughout the Bible, culminating in the ultimate relationship between God and humanity through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, tasked with naming the animals and seeking a suitable helper.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/livestock,_birds,_beasts_of_the_field.htm">Livestock, Birds, Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Represents the various forms of life that Adam named, highlighting his role in creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The setting where Adam resides and performs his duties, a place of initial harmony and order.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who observes Adam's need for companionship and prepares to address it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/naming_of_the_animals.htm">Naming of the Animals</a></b><br>An event that signifies Adam's authority and stewardship over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>Adam's task of naming the animals highlights the responsibility humanity has over creation.

This simple sentence describes a real, historical moment in which Adam exercises God-given authority.<p>&#8226; Naming in Scripture signals headship and stewardship. Just as <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> commissions humanity to &#8220;rule over&#8221; the creatures, Adam&#8217;s naming demonstrates that mandate in action.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6&#8211;8</a> echoes the same dignity: &#8220;You have placed everything under his feet&#8230; all sheep and oxen.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God brings each animal &#8220;to the man to see what he would name each one&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>), highlighting that Adam&#8217;s intellect and moral responsibility are already fully functioning before the Fall.<p>&#8226; By naming the &#8220;livestock&#8221; first&#8212;domesticated animals closest to human society&#8212;Scripture shows Adam beginning his task where creation most directly intersects with human life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the birds of the air</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;to the birds of the air.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Dominion extends upward. <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20</a> tells how God filled the skies, and now He hands stewardship of that realm to mankind as well.<p>&#8226; Observing and identifying bird species required Adam to look beyond immediate surroundings, reinforcing that human dominion is earth-wide, not localized.<p>&#8226; Jesus later points to birds as reminders of the Father&#8217;s ongoing care (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>). Adam&#8217;s first encounter with them would have underscored the same truth: creation is designed to declare the goodness of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to every beast of the field</b><p>Next, Adam names &#8220;every beast of the field.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This phrase covers the wild land animals introduced in <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>. Adam&#8217;s reach now spans what roams free as well as what dwells near.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a> notes that after the Flood &#8220;the fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth,&#8221; a change that highlights how much harmony originally existed when Adam named them.<p>&#8226; By cataloging every creature, Adam mirrors God&#8217;s earlier acts of ordering and separating (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>). Humanity is meant to reflect divine orderliness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But for Adam no suitable helper was found</b><p>After the grand survey, Scripture states, &#8220;But for Adam no suitable helper was found.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a> had already revealed God&#8217;s intention: &#8220;It is not good for the man to be alone.&#8221; The animal kingdom makes that need obvious.<p>&#8226; None of the creatures, though good, could supply the relational, spiritual, and covenantal companionship man required.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-8.htm">1 Corinthians 11:8-9</a> reminds us that &#8220;man did not come from woman, but woman from man&#8230; woman was created for man,&#8221; underscoring complementarity, not competition.<p>&#8226; The absence of a helper prepares the way for Eve&#8217;s creation (<a href="/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21-23</a>), showing that marriage is God&#8217;s deliberate design, anchored in creation order and affirmed by <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31</a> as a picture of Christ and the Church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/2-20.htm">Genesis 2:20</a> portrays Adam&#8217;s literal, historical task of naming every creature&#8212;a demonstration of God-delegated authority, keen intellect, and responsible stewardship. Yet the very exercise exposes that, among all creatures, only a woman fashioned by God Himself could complete the man. The verse therefore affirms both human dominion over creation and the divine institution of marriage, two truths woven into the fabric of the world from the beginning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And Adam gave names.</span>--Throughout this chapter Adam is but once mentioned as a proper name; and the regular phrase in the Hebrew is <span class= "ital">the adam, </span>that is, the man, except in the last clause of this verse. In <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a> there is a different word for man, namely, <span class= "ital">ish. </span>We must not confine this giving of names to the domestic animals, nor are we to suppose a long procession of beasts and birds passing before the man, and receiving each its title. Rather, it sets him before us as a keen observer of nature; and as he pursues his occupations in the garden, new animals and birds from time to time come under his notice, and these he studies, and observes their ways and habits, and so at length gives them appellations. Most of these titles would be imitations of their cries, or would be taken from some marked feature in their form or plumage, or mode of locomotion. Adam is thus found possessed of powers of observation and reflection upon the natural objects round him; though we may justly doubt his being capable of the metaphysical discourses put into his mouth by Milton in the <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost.</span><p><span class= "bld">But for Adam.</span>--In this one place there is no article, and our version may be right in regarding it as a proper name. Among the animals Adam found many ready to be his friends and domestic servants; and his habits of observation had probably this practical end, of taming such as might be useful. Hence the omission of all notice of reptiles and fish. But while thus he could tame many, and make them share his dwelling, he found among them no <span class= "ital">counterpart of himself, </span>capable of answering his thoughts and of holding with him rational discourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.</span> The portrait here delineated of the first man is something widely different from that of an infantile savage slowly groping his way towards the possession of articulate speech and intelligible language by imitation of the sounds of animals. Speech and language both spring full-formed, though not completely matured, from the <span class="accented">primus</span> homo of the Bible. As to the names that Adam gave the animals, with Calvin we need not doubt that they were founded on the best of reasons, though what they were it is impossible to discover, as it is not absolutely certain that Adam spoke in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</span> This was the chief reason for assembling the creatures. It was meant to reveal his loneliness. The longing for a partner was already deeply seated in his nature, and the survey of the animals, coming to him probably in pairs, could not fail to intensify that secret hunger of his soul, and perhaps evoke it into conscious operation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
