The name "Eber" is associated with the term "Hebrew," which is used to describe the descendants of Abraham. Eber's lineage is traced back to Shem, one of Noah's sons, emphasizing the continuity of God's promise through the generations.<p><b>One was named Peleg:</b><br>The name "Peleg" means "division" in Hebrew. This name is significant because it marks a pivotal moment in biblical history. Peleg is an ancestor of Abraham, and his lineage is crucial in the unfolding of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. The naming of Peleg is a reminder of the importance of names in the Bible, often reflecting significant events or characteristics.<p><b>because in his days the earth was divided:</b><br>This phrase is often interpreted as referring to the division of the peoples and languages at the Tower of Babel, as described in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>. The division of the earth could also imply a geographical or political separation. This event is a key moment in biblical history, illustrating God's intervention in human affairs and the scattering of nations. It sets the stage for the development of distinct cultures and languages, which plays a crucial role in the narrative of the Old Testament.<p><b>and his brother was named Joktan:</b><br>Joktan is the ancestor of several Arabian tribes, as listed in the following verses. His descendants are associated with the regions in the southern Arabian Peninsula. The mention of Joktan highlights the spread of humanity and the establishment of various nations and peoples. This genealogical detail underscores the diversity of human cultures and the fulfillment of God's command to "fill the earth" (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>).

But as Peleg, according to the <span class= "ital">Toldoth Shem, </span>was born only 101 years after the flood, Noah's family could scarcely have multiplied in so short a time to as many as 500 people; and Mr. Cyril Graham considers that the name refers to "the first cutting of some of those canals which are found in such numbers between the Tigris and the Euphrates."
