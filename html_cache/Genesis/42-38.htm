His response here is significant as it reflects his protective nature and deep concern for his family. This moment occurs during a severe famine, highlighting the dire circumstances that have led his sons to seek grain in Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;My son will not go down there with you</b><br>Jacob refers to Benjamin, his youngest son, whom he is reluctant to send to Egypt. This reflects Jacob's fear of losing another beloved son, as he believes Joseph, Benjamin's full brother, is dead. The phrase "go down" is geographically accurate, as Canaan is at a higher elevation than Egypt.<p><b>for his brother is dead</b><br>Jacob believes Joseph, Benjamin's brother, is dead, having been deceived by his other sons who sold Joseph into slavery. This belief has shaped Jacob's protective attitude towards Benjamin, as Joseph and Benjamin were the only sons of his favored wife, Rachel.<p><b>and he alone is left</b><br>Jacob's statement underscores his perception that Benjamin is the last remaining link to Rachel. This highlights the familial tensions and favoritism that have been a recurring theme in Jacob's life, affecting his relationships with his other sons.<p><b>If any harm comes to him on your journey</b><br>Jacob's fear for Benjamin's safety is palpable. The journey to Egypt was fraught with potential dangers, including bandits and the harsh desert environment. This concern reflects the broader biblical theme of the vulnerability of God's people in a fallen world.<p><b>you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.&#8221;</b><br>"Gray hair" symbolizes old age and wisdom, but here it also conveys Jacob's vulnerability and the depth of his grief. "Sheol" is the Hebrew term for the grave or the abode of the dead, indicating that Jacob believes the loss of Benjamin would lead to his own death from sorrow. This phrase captures the profound emotional weight of familial loss and the hope for redemption and restoration, themes that resonate throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, father of Joseph and Benjamin.

His word carries weight. Earlier he had already shown cautious leadership when famine struck (<a href="/genesis/42-1.htm">Genesis 42:1-2</a>). Here, his reply sets the stage for the tension between fear and faith that will run through the remaining Joseph narratives. Compare the serious tone of other patriarchal warnings such as Isaac&#8217;s charge to Jacob in <a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1-2</a> and Moses&#8217; sober words in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-27.htm">Deuteronomy 31:27</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My son will not go down there with you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Down there&#8221; points to Egypt, a land both of provision and perceived peril (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10-13</a>; 26:2-3).<p>&#8226; Jacob had allowed the older sons to go earlier (<a href="/genesis/42-3.htm">Genesis 42:3-4</a>) but draws a firm line regarding Benjamin.<p>This protective stance mirrors Abraham&#8217;s refusal to let Isaac accompany the servant back to Mesopotamia (<a href="/genesis/24-6.htm">Genesis 24:6-8</a>), highlighting a father&#8217;s vigilance over the covenant line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for his brother is dead</b><p>Jacob believes Joseph has perished (<a href="/genesis/37-31.htm">Genesis 37:31-35</a>).

The patriarch is not faithless; he is humanly cautious (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>).

Jacob&#8217;s refusal to release Benjamin spotlights human frailty, covenant concern, and parental love. While Jacob fears Sheol, the Lord is weaving a plan that will preserve the family and advance the promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The verse invites readers to trust God&#8217;s providence even when circumstances appear threatening and grief feels final.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">to Sheol </span>(See Note on <a href="/genesis/37-35.htm" title="And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning.

Jacob, both here and in <a href="/genesis/47-9.htm" title="And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.">Genesis 47:9</a>, speaks as one on whom sorrow had pressed very heavily. Always of a timid and affection Ate disposition, he looks onward now without hope, and sees in the future only dangers and ill-fortune. Probably by this time he had lost Leah as well as Rachel, but the blow that had struck him utterly down had evidently been the loss of Joseph, in whom Rachel had still seemed to live on for him. And therefore now he clung the more warmly to Benjamin, and it is plain that the father's deep sorrow for the loss of the petted son had softened the hearts of his brethren.
