This act is part of a larger scheme orchestrated by Rebekah to secure the blessing meant for Esau. The cultural context of the time placed immense importance on the father's blessing, which was seen as a prophetic and binding declaration over the future of the sons. Jacob's journey to his father also symbolizes the beginning of a significant transformation in his life, as he steps into a role that will define his future and the future of Israel.<p><b>and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221;</b><br>The address "My father" signifies both respect and intimacy. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, the father held a position of authority and reverence. This moment is charged with tension, as Jacob is about to deceive his father, Isaac, who is old and blind. The use of "My father" also highlights the personal nature of the blessing, which is intended to be a deeply personal and familial act.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am!&#8221; he answered.</b><br>Isaac's response, "Here I am," is a common biblical expression of readiness and attention. It echoes other significant biblical moments, such as Abraham's response to God in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>. This phrase indicates Isaac's openness and willingness to engage with his son, unaware of the deception about to unfold. It also reflects a moment of vulnerability, as Isaac is prepared to bestow a blessing that will shape the destiny of his descendants.<p><b>&#8220;Which one are you, my son?&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's question reveals his uncertainty and the beginning of his suspicion. The question underscores the theme of identity, which is central to Jacob's story. Throughout his life, Jacob struggles with issues of identity and deception, which are evident in this encounter. This moment foreshadows the future struggles Jacob will face, including his wrestling with God in <a href="/genesis/32.htm">Genesis 32</a>, where his identity is ultimately transformed. Isaac's question also highlights the importance of the firstborn's blessing, as he seeks to confirm the identity of the son who will receive it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The father of Esau and Jacob, Isaac is an aging patriarch who is preparing to bless his sons.

Throughout Genesis, God clarifies who belongs to His promise&#8212;Abram versus Lot (<a href="/bsb/genesis/13.htm">Genesis 13</a>), Isaac versus Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19-21</a>), and now Jacob versus Esau (<a href="/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the question echoes forward: &#8220;Who do you say I am?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-15.htm">Matthew 16:15</a>). Identity with the covenant family demands truth, and Jacob&#8217;s forthcoming lie highlights humanity&#8217;s need for redemption (<a href="/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-18.htm">Genesis 27:18</a> captures a pivotal exchange: Jacob approaches, addresses, receives a welcoming response, and then faces a probing question.
