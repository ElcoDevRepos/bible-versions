His authority over the land of Egypt was part of God's providential plan to save his family and many others from famine.

This mirrors how God sometimes allows difficult circumstances to bring about spiritual growth and repentance in believers (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>).

Egypt, being a powerful and resource-rich nation, would have been wary of foreign threats. This accusation forced the brothers to confront their past and their treatment of Joseph, leading to a deeper understanding of their own guilt and need for reconciliation.
