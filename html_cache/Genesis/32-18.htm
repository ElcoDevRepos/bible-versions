It reflects the careful planning and strategy Jacob employs in his approach to Esau, highlighting the importance of communication and preparation in resolving conflicts. This instruction is part of a larger plan to appease Esau, whom Jacob fears due to their past conflict over the birthright and blessing.<p><b>&#8216;They belong to your servant Jacob.</b><br>Jacob refers to himself as Esau's servant, which is significant given their history. This phrase demonstrates humility and submission, a stark contrast to Jacob's earlier actions when he deceived Esau. The use of "servant" is a cultural expression of respect and an attempt to mend their strained relationship. It also reflects the biblical theme of reconciliation and the importance of humility in relationships.<p><b>They are a gift,</b><br>The concept of a gift in ancient Near Eastern culture was often used to secure favor or reconciliation. Gifts were a common practice to show respect or to seek peace. This act of giving is symbolic of Jacob's desire to make amends and restore peace with Esau. It also prefigures the biblical principle of giving as a means of reconciliation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>.<p><b>sent to my lord Esau.</b><br>Referring to Esau as "my lord" is another expression of respect and submission. This phrase acknowledges Esau's position and authority, which Jacob had previously undermined. The use of "lord" is significant in the context of their relationship, as it shows Jacob's recognition of Esau's status and his own willingness to submit. This is a reversal of the earlier prophecy in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where the older would serve the younger, highlighting the complexity of their relationship.<p><b>And behold, Jacob is behind us.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase serves as a reassurance to Esau that Jacob is not far behind, indicating his willingness to meet Esau face-to-face. It shows Jacob's intention to personally reconcile with Esau, rather than merely sending gifts. The mention of Jacob being "behind" also suggests a strategic placement, allowing Esau to first receive the gifts and potentially soften his heart before meeting Jacob. This reflects the biblical theme of reconciliation and the courage required to face past wrongs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.
