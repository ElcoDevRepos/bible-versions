This period of twenty years is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing a complete cycle of waiting or preparation. Jacob's time with Laban was marked by hard work and perseverance, reflecting the trials and growth he experienced. This duration also connects to the broader narrative of Jacob's life, including his initial flight from Esau and his eventual return to Canaan, fulfilling God's promise to him.<p><b>Your sheep and goats have not miscarried,</b><br>Jacob emphasizes his diligent care for Laban's livestock, which did not suffer miscarriages under his watch. This detail underscores Jacob's integrity and the blessing of God upon his work. In the ancient Near East, livestock was a primary measure of wealth, and successful breeding was crucial. The absence of miscarriages can be seen as a sign of divine favor, similar to the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, where the fruit of the womb and livestock are blessed.<p><b>nor have I eaten the rams of your flock.</b><br>Jacob asserts his honesty and restraint by not taking what was not his, even when he had the opportunity. In the cultural context, shepherds were often allowed to consume some of the flock, but Jacob chose not to, highlighting his integrity. This behavior aligns with the biblical principle of stewardship and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which speaks of the righteous caring for their animals. Jacob's actions foreshadow the sacrificial nature of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is speaking to Laban, recounting his faithful service over twenty years.

Compare Jacob&#8217;s earlier willingness to serve seven years for Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-20.htm">Genesis 29:20</a>) and the subsequent seven years he stayed on (<a href="/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores endurance under difficult conditions; Jacob later says Laban &#8220;changed my wages ten times&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>). Yet Jacob remained, reflecting the call to faithful labor even when circumstances are unfair (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence sustained Jacob during this period, paralleling the Lord&#8217;s assurance to Moses, &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>).

This prefigures the principle later taught by Paul: &#8220;Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Such integrity aligns with the standard of faithful stewardship Jesus describes: &#8220;Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much&#8221; (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-38.htm">Genesis 31:38</a> reveals Jacob&#8217;s twenty-year record of loyal service, supernatural blessing, and uncompromising integrity. His endurance in hardship, meticulous care for Laban&#8217;s flock, and refusal to exploit what was not his all point to a life lived under God&#8217;s watchful eye. The verse encourages believers to serve faithfully, trust God for fruitfulness, and uphold honesty&#8212;confident that the Lord sees and rewards steadfast obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">been with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
