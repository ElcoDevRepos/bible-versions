Mesha is believed to be a region in the Arabian Peninsula, though its exact location is uncertain. This area is significant as it represents the early settlements of the Semitic peoples, who played a crucial role in biblical history. The mention of territory suggests a defined area of influence and control, which is important in understanding the spread of nations post-Flood.<p><b>to Sephar</b><br>Sephar is thought to be a location in the southern Arabian Peninsula, possibly near the modern-day Dhofar region in Oman. This area was known for its incense trade, which was a valuable commodity in ancient times. The mention of Sephar helps to delineate the extent of Joktan's descendants' influence and highlights the importance of trade routes in the ancient world. The connection to trade can be seen as a precursor to the economic systems that would later develop in the region.<p><b>in the eastern hill country</b><br>The eastern hill country refers to the mountainous regions of the Arabian Peninsula. This terrain would have provided natural protection and resources for the inhabitants. The mention of the hill country emphasizes the diversity of the land that Joktan's descendants occupied, from fertile plains to rugged mountains. This diversity is reflective of the varied environments that the descendants of Noah's sons would inhabit, fulfilling the command to "fill the earth" (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). The eastern location also suggests a movement away from the central areas of Mesopotamia, indicating the spread of peoples and cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mesha.htm">Mesha</a></b><br>A location mentioned as the starting point of the territory described in <a href="/genesis/10-30.htm">Genesis 10:30</a>.

<a href="/bsb/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a> is often called &#8220;The Table of Nations,&#8221; laying out the literal lineage of Noah&#8217;s sons after the Flood (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-19.htm">Genesis 9:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 30 sits in the paragraph about Joktan, son of Eber, whose thirteen sons spread into the Arabian Peninsula (<a href="/genesis/10-26.htm">Genesis 10:26-29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-20.htm">1 Chronicles 1:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The clause &#8220;Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country&#8221; marks the God-directed boundaries of these descendants, just as He previously fixed borders for Canaan (<a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>) and later for Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Geographical Markers</b><p>&#8226; Mesha &#8211; likely the northwestern starting point, aligning with later references to regions near southwestern Arabia (cf. <a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>, mentioning Arabian tribes in Solomon&#8217;s day).<p>&#8226; Sephar &#8211; understood as a southeastern locale on the Arabian seaboard, often linked with modern &#7778;afr or the Dhofar highlands of Oman.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Eastern hill country&#8221; &#8211; highlights that Joktan&#8217;s clan moved eastward from Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a>) into mountainous terrain, fulfilling God&#8217;s command to &#8220;fill the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Taken literally, the phrase sketches a swath of land stretching hundreds of miles, anticipating later caravan routes visited by Job&#8217;s Sabeans (<a href="/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>) and the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Significance for Joktan&#8217;s Descendants</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/psalms/72-15.htm">Psalm 72:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By noting precise borders, Scripture preserves the historical reality of distinct peoples, countering any mythological reading (<a href="/isaiah/19-23.htm">Isaiah 19:23-25</a> portrays real nations).<p>&#8226; The spread &#8220;from Mesha to Sephar&#8221; situates these tribes between Israel&#8217;s future neighbors: northwest of them lay Edom and Midian; to the south lay the Red Sea and Indian Ocean trade routes (<a href="/genesis/25-12.htm">Genesis 25:12-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Theological Implications</b><p>&#8226; God remains the sovereign &#8220;Boundary-Setter&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>), allocating land even to nations outside the covenant line.<p>&#8226; The detail underscores the literal fulfillment of God&#8217;s post-Flood blessing: &#8220;be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The ordered listing anticipates the promise to Abraham that &#8220;all the families of the earth&#8221; would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).

This boundary confirms God&#8217;s post-Flood mandate to populate the earth, displays His sovereign assignment of lands, and situates real peoples who will later intersect the covenant story.
