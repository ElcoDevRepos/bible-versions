This area was known for its pastures and trade routes. The brothers' ability to see Joseph from afar suggests the open landscape typical of the region. Joseph's distinctive coat, a symbol of his father's favoritism, likely made him recognizable from a distance. This moment foreshadows the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Joseph's journey to his brothers sets in motion events that will lead to the fulfillment of his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>).<p><b>and before he arrived</b><br>The anticipation of Joseph's arrival indicates the brothers' premeditated thoughts and emotions. Their actions were not impulsive but rather a culmination of deep-seated jealousy and resentment. This moment highlights the human tendency to harbor grudges and the destructive power of envy, which is warned against in scriptures such as <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>.<p><b>they plotted to kill him</b><br>The brothers' conspiracy to kill Joseph reflects the severity of their animosity. This act of plotting is reminiscent of Cain's murder of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>), showcasing the recurring theme of sibling rivalry and violence in Genesis. The brothers' plan also serves as a type of Christ, as Joseph, the beloved son, is rejected and betrayed by his own, paralleling Jesus' rejection by His people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). This plot, however, is ultimately thwarted by God's sovereign plan, which uses human evil to bring about His purposes, as seen in Joseph's eventual rise to power in Egypt and the preservation of his family during famine (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, known for his dreams that foretold his future rise to power.

Their ability to recognize him &#8220;in the distance&#8221; reminds us how familiar they were with his appearance&#8212;perhaps his distinctive coat still marked him out (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing Joseph should have stirred familial affection, yet it triggered resentment that had been simmering since his dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes the significance of what people see from afar: the father spotting the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), Balaam viewing Israel from a distance (<a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>). Here, sight becomes the spark for sin.<p>&#8226; The moment calls believers to examine first impressions: unchecked envy can ignite quickly (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and before he arrived</b><p>&#8226; There is a brief window between sight and arrival&#8212;a span filled with opportunity either to welcome or to scheme.<p>&#8226; This pause exposes how sin takes root in the heart before any action is taken, echoing Jesus&#8217; warning that anger precedes murder (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; James traces the same trajectory: &#8220;Desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>). The brothers&#8217; minds race ahead to violence before a word is exchanged.<p>&#8226; The phrase also highlights Joseph&#8217;s vulnerability; he is alone, unaware, and still trusting, much like David delivering provisions to his brothers before facing Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they plotted to kill him</b><p>&#8226; The conspiracy is deliberate. &#8220;Plotted&#8221; mirrors the premeditation of Cain against Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>) and foreshadows later betrayals of the righteous, such as the leaders&#8217; plan to kill Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Hatred within a covenant family is especially tragic. <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10&#8211;11</a> warns against joining violence; <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a> equates murderous intent with murder itself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/7-9.htm">Acts 7:9</a> notes, &#8220;The patriarchs&#8230; sold Joseph into Egypt,&#8221; spotlighting this verse as the moment their hearts crossed the line from jealousy to intended homicide.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign hand is not absent; what they mean for evil will become the very means of Joseph&#8217;s rise and Israel&#8217;s preservation (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joseph&#8217;s brothers glimpse him, mull over murderous thoughts, and hatch a deadly plan&#8212;all before he reaches them. The verse exposes how envy, left unchecked, can sprint from sight to scheme. It challenges us to guard our hearts in the earliest moments of resentment, trusting God to redeem even the darkest intentions for His saving purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they saw him afar off, even</span> (or, and) <span class="cmt_word">before he came near unto them, they</span> (literally, and <span class="accented">they</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>conspired against him</span> (or, dealt with him fraudulently) <span class="cmt_word">to slay him</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/37-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now [Joseph&#8217;s brothers] saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yir&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
