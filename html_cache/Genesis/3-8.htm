The "voice of the LORD God" suggests a direct communication, emphasizing God's desire for fellowship with Adam and Eve. This moment occurs after the fall, highlighting the shift from innocence to awareness of sin. The term "LORD God" combines the covenant name Yahweh with Elohim, underscoring both His personal and sovereign nature.<p><b>walking in the garden in the breeze of the day</b><br>The imagery of God "walking" suggests His immanence and accessibility. The "breeze of the day" likely refers to the cool part of the day, possibly late afternoon or early evening, a time when people would typically rest and reflect. This setting contrasts with the tension of the narrative, as it was a time meant for communion, now marred by sin.<p><b>and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God</b><br>Adam and Eve's attempt to hide signifies the immediate impact of sin, which is separation from God. This act of hiding reflects guilt and shame, emotions that were absent before the fall. Theologically, it illustrates the human tendency to flee from God when confronted with sin, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in Jonah's flight from God's command.<p><b>among the trees of the garden</b><br>The garden, initially a place of life and abundance, becomes a place of concealment and fear. The trees, once symbols of provision and beauty, are now used as a means to hide from God. This setting foreshadows the need for redemption and restoration, themes that are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is depicted as walking in the garden, indicating a personal and relational aspect of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man (Adam)</a></b><br>The first human created by God, who is now hiding due to his disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Eve)</a></b><br>The first woman, who, alongside Adam, is hiding from God after eating the forbidden fruit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The perfect dwelling place created by God for Adam and Eve, symbolizing peace and communion with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breeze_of_the_day.htm">The Breeze of the Day</a></b><br>This phrase suggests a specific time when God would commune with Adam and Eve, indicating a routine fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to separation from God and a desire to hide from His presence.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s pursuing heart, mankind&#8217;s immediate alienation, and the futility of self-concealment. Even here, the stage is set for redemption, as the same God who walked in Eden will one day walk among us in Christ to restore what was lost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden.</span>--The matter-of-fact school of commentators understand by this that there was a thunderstorm, and the guilty pair hearing for the first time the uproar of nature, hid themselves in terror, and interpreted the mighty peals as meaning their condemnation. Really it is in admirable keeping with the whole narrative; and Jehovah appears here as the owner of the Paradise, and as taking in it His daily exercise; for the verb is in the reflexive conjugation, and means "walking for pleasure." The time is "the cool (literally, <span class= "ital">the wind</span>) of the day," the hour in a hot climate when the evening breeze sets in, and men, rising from their noontide slumber, go forth for labour or recreation. In this description the primary lesson is that hitherto man had lived in close communication with God. His intellect was undeveloped; his mental powers still slumbered; but nevertheless there was a deep spiritual sympathy between him and his Maker. It is the nobler side of Adam's relationship to God before the fall.<p><span class= "bld">Hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God.</span>--This does not imply a visible appearance, for the whole narrative is anthropomorphic. The Fathers, however, saw in these descriptions the proof of a previous incarnation of the Divine Son (see Note on <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>). Next, we find in their conduct an attempt to escape from the further result of sin. The first result was shame, from which man endeavoured to free himself by covering his person; the second was fear, and this man would cure by departing still farther from God. But the voice of Jehovah reaches him, and with rebuke and punishment gives also healing and hope.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they heard the voice of the Lord God</span>.
