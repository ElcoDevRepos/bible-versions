In the context of <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, God had just promised Abram numerous descendants and land. Abram's belief is significant because it occurs before the fulfillment of these promises, demonstrating trust in God's word. This act of faith is foundational in the biblical narrative and is later referenced in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6</a>, where Paul uses Abram's faith as a model for Christian belief. Abram's faith is not based on visible evidence but on the assurance of God's promise, illustrating the essence of faith as described in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>.<p><b>and it was credited to him</b><br>The term "credited" is an accounting term, indicating that something is reckoned or counted. In the cultural and historical context, this implies a legal or formal acknowledgment of a status or condition. This concept of crediting righteousness is pivotal in understanding the doctrine of justification by faith, which is a cornerstone of Christian theology. It suggests that righteousness is not earned by works but is granted by God through faith. This principle is further elaborated in the New Testament, where it is applied to all believers, showing that righteousness before God is a gift, not a result of human effort.<p><b>as righteousness</b><br>Righteousness in this context refers to a right standing before God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, righteousness was often associated with fulfilling obligations in relationships, whether with God or with others. Abram's faith is seen as fulfilling his relational obligation to trust God, and thus God considers him righteous. This sets a precedent for the biblical theme that righteousness is based on faith rather than adherence to the law, a theme that is central to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. The concept of righteousness through faith is also prophetic, pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect righteousness and offers it to believers through faith in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>A key patriarch in the Bible, Abram is called by God to leave his homeland and is promised to be the father of a great nation.
