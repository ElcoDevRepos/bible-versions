The setting of the sun and the onset of darkness symbolize a transition from the ordinary to the extraordinary, often marking moments of divine intervention in biblical narratives. Darkness can also represent the unknown or the mysterious, preparing the reader for a revelation from God. In the broader biblical context, darkness is sometimes associated with God's presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>, where Moses approaches the thick darkness where God was.<p><b>behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared</b><br>The smoking firepot and flaming torch are symbolic representations of God's presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, fire and smoke were common symbols of the divine, often used in covenant-making ceremonies. The imagery here is reminiscent of God's presence at Mount Sinai, where He appeared in fire and smoke (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). The firepot and torch signify God's holiness, purity, and guidance. This theophany underscores the seriousness and sacredness of the covenant being established with Abram.<p><b>and passed between the halves of the carcasses</b><br>This action is part of an ancient covenant ritual known as a "covenant cutting," where animals were split in half, and the parties involved would walk between the pieces. This act signified a binding agreement, with the implication that breaking the covenant would result in a fate similar to that of the animals. In this context, God alone passes between the halves, indicating that He is unilaterally committing to the promises made to Abram. This foreshadows the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where God takes the initiative to fulfill His promises to humanity. The imagery of sacrifice and covenant here points to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who establishes a new and everlasting covenant through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is the recipient of God's covenant.
