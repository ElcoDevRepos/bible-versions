The concept of divine choice is central to the narrative of the Old Testament, where God selects individuals and nations for specific purposes. Abraham's selection is foundational for the establishment of Israel as God's chosen people. This choice is not based on Abraham's merit but on God's grace and purpose, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>, where God explains His choice of Israel.<p><b>so that he will command his children and his household after him</b><br>Abraham's role as a patriarch involves instructing his family in the ways of God. This reflects the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where the family unit was central, and the patriarch held significant authority and responsibility. The emphasis on teaching future generations is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach God's commandments to their children.<p><b>to keep the way of the LORD</b><br>The "way of the LORD" refers to living according to God's commandments and statutes. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience is a response to God's grace. The concept of "the way" is further developed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as "the way" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), indicating that following Him is the fulfillment of living in God's way.<p><b>by doing what is right and just</b><br>Righteousness and justice are central themes in the Bible, reflecting God's character. Abraham is called to model these attributes, which are essential for maintaining a covenant relationship with God. The prophets frequently call Israel back to righteousness and justice, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. These qualities are also embodied in Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfills God's standards of righteousness and justice.<p><b>in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has promised.</b><br>This phrase highlights the conditional aspect of God's promises, which often require human cooperation through obedience. God's promises to Abraham include making him a great nation and blessing all nations through him (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of these promises is found in Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham, through whom all nations are blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

And this purpose was, that from Abraham should spring a nation whose institutions were to be fraught with Divine truth, whose prophets were to be the means of revealing God's will to man, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, the Messiah should come. What more fitting than that one appointed to fill so noble a calling should also be raised to the rank of a prophet, and be permitted to share in the Divine counsels?
