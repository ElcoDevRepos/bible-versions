This scene sets the stage for a pivotal moment in their relationship. Cooking stew suggests a settled, pastoral life, which aligns with Jacob's character as a "quiet man, dwelling in tents" (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>). The act of cooking can symbolize preparation and foresight, traits that Jacob exhibits throughout his life. This moment foreshadows the significant exchange that will occur, highlighting Jacob's cunning nature.<p><b>Esau came in from the field</b><br>Esau, the elder twin, is characterized by his skills as a hunter and his connection to the outdoors. His return from the field indicates his active, labor-intensive lifestyle. The field represents the world and its pursuits, which can be seen as a metaphor for Esau's focus on immediate, physical needs over spiritual or long-term considerations. This moment underscores the contrast between Esau's impulsive nature and Jacob's strategic thinking. The field also connects to the broader biblical theme of labor and toil, reminiscent of the curse in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>.<p><b>and was famished</b><br>Esau's physical hunger is a critical element in this narrative, as it drives the subsequent exchange of his birthright for a meal. This hunger symbolizes a deeper spiritual emptiness and lack of discernment. In biblical terms, famished can represent a state of spiritual need or desperation, as seen in other scriptures where physical hunger parallels spiritual longing (e.g., <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>). Esau's prioritization of immediate gratification over his birthright reflects a broader biblical warning against valuing temporal desires over eternal blessings, as later emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, known for his cunning and desire for the birthright.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, a skilled hunter who is impulsive and driven by immediate needs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/birthright.htm">Birthright</a></b><br>A significant inheritance and blessing traditionally given to the firstborn son, including leadership of the family and a double portion of the inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lentil_stew.htm">Lentil Stew</a></b><br>The meal Jacob prepared, which Esau desired, leading to the exchange of his birthright.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/field.htm">Field</a></b><br>The place where Esau was coming from, likely tired and hungry from hunting.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_spiritual_inheritance.htm">Value of Spiritual Inheritance</a></b><br>The birthright represents spiritual blessings and responsibilities.

Coming home one day weary, and fainting with hunger, he found Jacob preparing a pottage of lentils. No sooner did the savoury smell reach him than he cried out in haste, "Let me swallow, I pray, of the red, this red." The verb expresses extreme eagerness, and he adds no noun whatever, but points to the steaming dish. And Jacob, seeing his brother's greediness and ravenous hunger, refuses to give him food until he has parted with the high and sacred prerogative which made him the inheritor of the Divine promise.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore was his name called Edom.</span>--Esau may have been called Edom, that is, <span class= "ital">Rufus, </span>the red one, before, but after this act it ceased to be a mere allusive by name, and became his ordinary appellation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob sod pottage</span>: - literally, <span class="accented">cooked something cooked</span>;
