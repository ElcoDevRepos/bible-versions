Kenan, also spelled Cainan, is part of the antediluvian patriarchs, a group of individuals who lived before the Great Flood. The genealogies in Genesis serve to connect the creation narrative to the story of Noah and the flood, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan through specific chosen individuals. Kenan's name is significant in Hebrew, meaning "possession" or "sorrow," which may reflect the human condition post-Fall. This lineage is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in <a href="/luke/3-37.htm">Luke 3:37</a>, highlighting the importance of these early figures in the biblical narrative.<p><b>Enosh lived 815 years</b><br>The long lifespans recorded in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> are a subject of much discussion. These extended ages may symbolize the vitality and blessing of the early human race, living closer to the perfection of creation. Enosh's lifespan, like others in this genealogy, underscores the gradual decline in human longevity post-Flood, as seen in later genealogies. The name Enosh means "man" or "mortal," reflecting the frailty and transience of human life, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a> and <a href="/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that the genealogies in Genesis are selective, focusing on the line through which God's covenant promises are fulfilled. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests a broader population than the specific line mentioned, which is important for understanding the spread of humanity across the earth. This detail also highlights the biblical theme of fruitfulness and multiplication, as commanded in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. The presence of other children ensures the continuation of human society and the fulfillment of God's command to fill the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enosh.htm">Enosh</a></b><br>The grandson of Adam and the son of Seth.

God keeps the redemptive line intact, a thread later affirmed in <a href="/luke/3-37.htm">Luke 3:37</a> where both Enosh and Kenan appear in Jesus&#8217; genealogy.<p>- The text reminds us that God is personally involved with each generation. Just as <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4&#8211;7</a> urges fathers to pass on faith, Enosh&#8217;s life illustrates the relay of truth from one era to the next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Enosh lived 815 years</b><p>- Scripture presents this figure as literal. Before the flood, extended life spans were common (see <a href="/genesis/5-8.htm">Genesis 5:8, 5</a>:11, 5:17).<p>- These centuries allowed overlapping lifetimes so that first-hand knowledge of God&#8217;s works could be shared directly, preserving doctrinal purity (contrast that with the abbreviated life expectancy described in <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> after sin&#8217;s cumulative effects).<p>- Second Peter 3:8 reminds us that God stands outside time; His purposes unfold patiently, and the lengthy days of the patriarchs reflect His long-suffering grace before judgment arrived in <a href="/bsb/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6&#8211;7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><p>- The phrase shows that the genealogy is selective, not exhaustive. While Kenan advances the messianic line, countless unnamed children also descended from Enosh, fulfilling the command to &#8220;be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p>- By noting &#8220;other sons and daughters,&#8221; Moses underscores the rapid population growth that made a global flood (<a href="/bsb/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>) morally necessary and socially impactful.<p>- <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a> later echoes this truth: from one man God made every nation. Humanity&#8217;s unity and diversity both trace back to these early families.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/5-10.htm">Genesis 5:10</a> records a real father, a literal 815-year lifespan, and a growing family.
