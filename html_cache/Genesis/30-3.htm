This practice is also seen with Sarah and Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>. Maidservants were often considered part of the household and could be given to the husband to produce heirs.<p><b>Sleep with her,</b><br>The act of a husband sleeping with a maidservant to produce offspring was a socially accepted solution to infertility in the patriarchal society. This reflects the importance placed on lineage and inheritance, as well as the desperation felt by women like Rachel to fulfill their roles as mothers.<p><b>that she may bear children for me,</b><br>Rachel's desire for children through Bilhah highlights the deep personal and societal pressure to produce offspring. Children were seen as a blessing and a sign of divine favor, and a woman's status was often tied to her ability to bear children.<p><b>so that through her I too can build a family.&#8221;</b><br>Rachel's statement underscores the concept of surrogacy in the ancient world, where children born to a maidservant were legally considered the children of the wife. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God working through human actions and decisions, even those that deviate from His original design for marriage. The narrative also foreshadows the complex family dynamics and sibling rivalries that will arise, particularly between the sons of Leah and Rachel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who is barren and desperate to have children.

Earlier, in <a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>, she pleaded with Jacob, &#8220;Give me children, or I will die!&#8221; Her words now echo Sarah&#8217;s suggestion to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>, where desperation led to Hagar&#8217;s involvement. In both moments, the wives act out of real anguish over barrenness, yet God remains sovereign over every womb (<a href="/psalms/113-9.htm">Psalm 113:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Here is my maidservant Bilhah.</b><p>Bilhah was already part of the household, given to Rachel by Laban when Rachel married Jacob (<a href="/genesis/29-29.htm">Genesis 29:29</a>). In the cultural setting, a maidservant could serve as a surrogate, and any child she bore would legally belong to her mistress. The practice, though never commanded, is recorded factually&#8212;Scripture faithfully narrates people&#8217;s choices while later showing God&#8217;s gracious plan working even through human weakness (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>Key reminders:<p>&#8226; Possession of servants was common (<a href="/genesis/24-59.htm">Genesis 24:59</a>), though not always handled rightly.<p>&#8226; The verse records what happened; it does not endorse every custom as ideal (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a> warns future kings against multiplying wives).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sleep with her,</b><p>Rachel tells Jacob plainly what action she expects. Similar wording appears when Sarai tells Abram, &#8220;Go, please, sleep with my maidservant&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>). While Jacob could have refused, he consents, and Scripture reveals both the responsibility of the man (<a href="/genesis/30-4.htm">Genesis 30:4</a>) and the complexity that polygamy introduces&#8212;rivalry, jealousy, and household strife (<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>). Yet even amid disorder, God&#8217;s covenant promise of offspring to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob presses forward (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that she may bear children for me,</b><p>The stated goal is children. In ancient times, childlessness carried social stigma and threatened a family&#8217;s future. Scripture treats children as a blessing: &#8220;Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). Rachel&#8217;s words confess that reproductive ability ultimately lies outside human control; God later &#8220;remembered Rachel&#8221; and opened her own womb (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that through her I too can build a family.</b><p>Rachel longs to &#8220;build&#8221; (literally, to be built up) through Bilhah&#8217;s offspring, seeking a share in Jacob&#8217;s lineage. Scripture often uses construction language for family growth: <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a> blesses Boaz to &#8220;build up the house of Israel,&#8221; and <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a> notes God &#8220;built up&#8221; households for the midwives who feared Him. By Bilhah, Rachel will receive Dan and Naphtali (<a href="/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6&#8211;8</a>), tribes permanently engraved on Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/revelation/7-6.htm">Revelation 7:6</a>). God weaves even imperfect human strategies into His larger, perfect plan (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3</a> records Rachel&#8217;s decision to give Bilhah to Jacob as a surrogate. Her words reveal deep yearning, cultural customs, and human impatience, yet God still advances His covenant. The verse testifies that:<p>&#8226; Human schemes cannot thwart divine sovereignty.<p>&#8226; Children are a gift God alone ultimately grants.<p>&#8226; Even flawed decisions become threads in God&#8217;s redemptive tapestry, culminating in the people and promises that lead to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Behold my maid Bilhah.</span>--Rachel had little excuse for this action; for there was no religious hope involved, as when Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/16-2.htm" title="And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing: I pray you, go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.">Genesis 16:2</a>), but solely vexation at her own barrenness, and envy of her sister. All that can be said in her defence is, that the custom existed, and, perhaps, because it was distasteful to the wife, was looked upon as meritorious (<a href="/genesis/30-18.htm" title="And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.">Genesis 30:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">She shall bear upon my knees.</span>--So in <a href="/genesis/1-23.htm" title="And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.">Genesis 1:23</a>, it is said, in the Hebrew, that "the children of Machir were born upon Joseph's knees," not <span class= "ital">borne, </span>as in our margin. It appears that there was a custom of placing the new-born child upon the knees, first of the father, who, by accepting it. acknowledged the infant as his own; and secondly, upon those of the mother. In this case, as Bilhah's children were regarded as legally born of Rachel, they would be placed upon Rachel's knees. Probably, too, the children of Machir, by being placed upon Joseph's knees, were in some way adopted by him.<p><span class= "bld">That I may also have children by her.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">be built by her. </span>(See Note on <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm" title="And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing: I pray you, go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.
