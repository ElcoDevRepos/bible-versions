This practice, while seemingly superstitious, reflects the ancient belief in sympathetic magic, where visual stimuli were thought to influence physical outcomes. The peeled branches may symbolize Jacob's cunning and resourcefulness, as he uses natural means to achieve his ends. This act also demonstrates his understanding of animal husbandry, as he attempts to influence the breeding process.<p><b>in front of the flocks coming in to drink.</b><br>The placement of the branches in front of the flocks as they come to drink is significant. Watering troughs were communal places where animals gathered, making it an ideal location for Jacob's plan. This setting underscores the importance of water sources in pastoral life, as they were essential for the survival and health of the flocks. The strategic positioning of the branches suggests an intentional effort to ensure that the animals are exposed to the visual stimuli at a critical time.<p><b>So when the flocks were in heat and came to drink,</b><br>The timing of the flocks being in heat is crucial to Jacob's plan. The phrase indicates a natural breeding cycle, which Jacob seeks to influence. This reflects an understanding of animal behavior and reproduction, as well as the importance of timing in agricultural practices. The connection between the animals' natural instincts and Jacob's intervention highlights the interplay between divine providence and human agency. This moment can also be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bless Jacob, as his efforts lead to the multiplication of his wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and a key patriarch in the Bible.
