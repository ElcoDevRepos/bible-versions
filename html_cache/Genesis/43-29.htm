This moment is significant as Benjamin is the only other son of Rachel, Joseph's beloved mother. The emotional weight of this reunion is profound, as Joseph's last memories of his family were filled with betrayal and separation. The sight of Benjamin likely stirred deep emotions, reminding Joseph of his past and his mother's love.<p><b>his own mother&#8217;s son</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unique bond between Joseph and Benjamin, as they were the only two sons of Rachel, Jacob's favored wife. This connection is crucial in understanding Joseph's special affection for Benjamin, distinguishing him from his other brothers. Rachel's death during Benjamin's birth adds a layer of poignancy to their relationship, as Benjamin represents the last living link to their mother.<p><b>he asked, &#8220;Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's inquiry serves as a confirmation of Benjamin's identity. The brothers had previously mentioned Benjamin to Joseph, unaware of his true identity. This question also reflects Joseph's careful and strategic approach in dealing with his brothers, as he seeks to verify their honesty and intentions. It highlights the tension and suspense in the narrative, as Joseph's true identity remains hidden from his brothers.<p><b>Then he declared, &#8220;May God be gracious to you, my son.&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's blessing upon Benjamin is both a personal and spiritual gesture. By invoking God's grace, Joseph expresses a heartfelt wish for Benjamin's well-being, reflecting his deep love and concern. This blessing also serves as a subtle indication of Joseph's continued faith in God, despite his years in Egypt. The use of "my son" is a term of endearment, underscoring the familial bond and Joseph's protective feelings towards Benjamin. This moment foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and restoration of Joseph's relationship with his brothers, aligning with the broader biblical theme of forgiveness and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to power.
