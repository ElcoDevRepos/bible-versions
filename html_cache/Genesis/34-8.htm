The Hivites were among the inhabitants of the land that God promised to the descendants of Abraham. This interaction takes place in the city of Shechem, which is significant in biblical history as a place of covenant and conflict. Hamor's approach to Jacob and his sons indicates a customary practice of negotiation for marriage, reflecting the patriarchal and tribal society of the time.<p><b>&#8220;My son Shechem longs for your daughter.</b><br>Shechem's desire for Dinah, Jacob's daughter, is expressed here. The word "longs" suggests a deep desire or affection, though the context of the preceding verses indicates that Shechem's actions were dishonorable. This reflects the complex nature of human relationships and the consequences of actions outside of God's covenantal boundaries. The narrative highlights the tension between personal desire and communal ethics.<p><b>Please give her to him as his wife.</b><br>Hamor's request is a formal proposal for marriage, which was a common practice to resolve disputes or form alliances between families or tribes. In the ancient Near Eastern context, marriages often served political or economic purposes, beyond personal relationships. This request also underscores the cultural norms of the time, where women were often seen as part of familial transactions. The plea for Dinah to become Shechem's wife contrasts with the covenantal values of the Israelites, who were called to be separate from the surrounding nations. This situation foreshadows the ongoing struggle for the Israelites to maintain their distinct identity amidst surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince.

This reveals his awareness that the brothers&#8212;not Jacob&#8212;hold the emotional leverage after Dinah&#8217;s violation.<p>&#8226; Hamor is opening a formal negotiation, much like Abraham did with the Hittites over Sarah&#8217;s burial site (<a href="/genesis/23-3.htm">Genesis 23:3-6</a>). Yet, while Abraham sought a burial place in faith, Hamor is seeking to cover sin with a pragmatic alliance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a> notes, &#8220;The first to state his case seems right until another comes and cross-examines him.&#8221; Hamor speaks first, hoping to shape the narrative before the brothers can demand justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My son Shechem longs for your daughter</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Longs&#8221; points to intense desire, but the preceding story shows it is desire that already overstepped God&#8217;s moral boundary (<a href="/genesis/34-1.htm">Genesis 34:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare Amnon&#8217;s so-called &#8220;love&#8221; for Tamar that quickly turned to hatred after he violated her (<a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1-15</a>). Desire apart from obedience corrodes true affection.<p>&#8226; True love &#8220;does not dishonor others&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>), yet Shechem dishonored Dinah by taking her before marriage.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> reminds us that unchecked desire &#8220;gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.&#8221; Shechem&#8217;s longing is already bearing rotten fruit: violence, deceit, and looming bloodshed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please give her to him as his wife</b><p>&#8226; Hamor appeals for a legal resolution&#8212;marriage&#8212;to legitimize the illegitimate.<p>&#8226; The phrase mirrors earlier patriarchal negotiations for brides (<a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50-51</a>; 29:18-19), but here it is used to mask sin rather than celebrate covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Intermarriage with Canaanites had been strongly discouraged (<a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1</a>; later codified in <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>). Hamor&#8217;s offer therefore tempts Jacob&#8217;s family to compromise their distinct calling.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> warns, &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers,&#8221; a principle foreshadowed in this very scene.<p>&#8226; Beneath Hamor&#8217;s polite request lies an agenda: secure economic and social integration (<a href="/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21-23</a>), turning a moral offense into a political merger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-8.htm">Genesis 34:8</a> presents Hamor&#8217;s polished attempt to transform his son&#8217;s sin into an alliance with Jacob&#8217;s family. By flattering the brothers, glossing over Shechem&#8217;s wrongdoing, and proposing marriage, Hamor seeks to legitimize lust and secure advantage. The verse contrasts human diplomacy with God&#8217;s moral order, reminding us that true love honors God&#8217;s standards, protects the vulnerable, and refuses to trade righteousness for convenience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hamor communed</span> (literally, <span class="accented">spake</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole family, or Jacob and his sons), saying, <span class="cmt_word">The soul of my son Shechem longeth for</span> - the root (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>) signifies to join together, intrans., to be joined together, hence to cleave to another in love (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7, 10, 15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11</a>); of similar import to the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>) employed in ver. 3, which means to be devotedly attached to any one, as, <span class="accented">e.g., to God</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>), to a king (<a href="/2_samuel/20-2.htm">2 Samuel 20:2</a>), to a wife (<a href="/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">your daughter</span>.

The absence of any apology for Shechem's atrocious outrage against Dinah need not be regarded as indicating some measure of consent on the part of Dinah, but may be explained on the supposition that Hamor's proposal was considered by himself as a practical admission of his son's guilt. <span class="cmt_word">And make ye marriages with us</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">contract affinity with us by marriage</span>, the verb <span class="accented">chathan</span> being spoken of the father-in-law (<span class="accented">chothen</span>), who makes the alliance (<span class="accented">vide</span> Furst, 'Lex.,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>) <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>and give your daughters unto us</span>, - from this it has been inferred that Jacob had other daughters besides Dinah, which is not improbable (<a href="/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>), but the words may not imply more than that Humor thought he had - <span class="cmt_word">and take our daughters unto you.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (as an inducement to form this alliance) <span class="cmt_word">ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
