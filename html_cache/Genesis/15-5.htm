The act of taking Abram outside suggests a change in perspective, moving from the confines of a tent to the vastness of the open sky. This physical movement symbolizes a shift from limited human understanding to the expansive possibilities of God's promises. In biblical context, God often uses physical actions to illustrate spiritual truths, as seen in other instances like Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-4</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Now look to the heavens</b><br>The heavens are frequently used in Scripture to represent God's majesty and the vastness of His creation (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>). By directing Abram's gaze upward, God is inviting him to consider the infinite nature of His power and promises. This act of looking to the heavens is a call to faith, encouraging Abram to trust in what he cannot yet see, much like the call to walk by faith and not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>and count the stars, if you are able.&#8221;</b><br>The challenge to count the stars emphasizes the innumerable nature of Abram's future descendants. In the ancient Near East, stars were often associated with divine beings or the divine order, and their countless number was a symbol of abundance and blessing. This imagery is echoed in other biblical promises of numerous descendants, such as the sand on the seashore (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). The impossibility of counting the stars underscores the miraculous nature of God's promise.<p><b>Then He told him, &#8220;So shall your offspring be.&#8221;</b><br>This promise is a pivotal moment in the Abrahamic covenant, establishing Abram as the father of a great nation. It is a reaffirmation of God's earlier promise in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> and is foundational for the narrative of Israel's history. The term "offspring" not only refers to Abram's immediate descendants but also prophetically points to the coming of Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abram, through whom all nations would be blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>). This promise is fulfilled both physically, in the nation of Israel, and spiritually, in the multitude of believers who are considered children of Abraham by faith (<a href="/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is later renamed Abraham. He is a key patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God. At this point in Genesis, Abram is childless and concerned about his legacy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God who speaks directly to Abram, promising him descendants as numerous as the stars.

With his senses dormant, but alive to every spiritual impression, Abram feels himself led forth from the tent into the open space around, and is there commanded to count the stars. As a matter of fact, the stars visible to the naked eye are not very numerous, but they have ever been a received metaphor for an infinite multitude, probably because, as men gaze, they perpetually see the faint radiance of more and more distant constellations. Thus they cannot be counted, and Abram's seed was to be countless, because of the vastness of its number.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> (Jehovah, or "the Word of the Lord") <span class="cmt_word">brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them</span> (a proof that Abram's vision was not a dream): <span class="cmt_word">and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be</span>.
