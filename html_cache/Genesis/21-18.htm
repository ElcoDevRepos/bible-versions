In the biblical context, it signifies a divine intervention where God is instructing Hagar to rise from her despair. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God commands individuals to rise, such as when He tells Joshua to "get up" after Israel's defeat at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-10.htm">Joshua 7:10</a>). It emphasizes God's active role in human affairs and His ability to change circumstances.<p><b>Lift up the boy</b><br>The boy referred to here is Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. This phrase indicates a physical and emotional act of support and care. In the cultural context of the time, a mother lifting up her child symbolizes protection and nurturing. It also foreshadows God's promise to sustain and bless Ishmael, despite his and Hagar's current predicament in the wilderness.<p><b>And take him by the hand</b><br>Taking someone by the hand is a gesture of guidance and reassurance. In biblical symbolism, it represents God's guidance and presence. This act signifies Hagar's role in leading Ishmael towards his future, under God's promise. It parallels other biblical narratives where God leads His people by the hand, such as in <a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm">Isaiah 41:13</a>, where God promises to hold the right hand of His people.<p><b>For I will make him into a great nation</b><br>This promise is a reiteration of God's earlier covenant with Abraham regarding Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>). It highlights God's faithfulness to His promises and His sovereign plan for all nations. Historically, Ishmael is considered the ancestor of many Arab peoples, fulfilling this prophecy. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's blessing extending beyond Israel, as seen in the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Testament (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian servant of Sarah, Abraham's wife, and the mother of Ishmael.
