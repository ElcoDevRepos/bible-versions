The speaker is one of the angels sent by God to execute judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah. The angel's response shows divine willingness to listen to human intercession, reflecting God's mercy and readiness to spare even a small remnant for the sake of the righteous. This echoes Abraham's earlier intercession for Sodom in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, where he pleads for the city if righteous people can be found.<p><b>&#8220;I will grant this request as well,</b><br>The granting of the request highlights the power of intercessory prayer and God's responsiveness to it. Lot, Abraham's nephew, had pleaded for the safety of a small town, Zoar, as a refuge. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s willingness to relent from sending calamity if there is genuine repentance or a plea for mercy, as seen in the story of Nineveh in <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>.<p><b>and will not demolish the town you indicate.</b><br>The town referred to is Zoar, a small city near Sodom and Gomorrah. Its sparing signifies God's grace and the importance of even a single righteous person's influence. Geographically, Zoar was located in the plain of Jordan, an area known for its fertility and strategic location. Historically, this event underscores the severity of Sodom and Gomorrah's sin, as their destruction serves as a warning against wickedness. Theologically, this act of sparing Zoar can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides refuge and salvation from impending judgment for those who seek it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to execute judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah, and to rescue Lot and his family.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Abraham's nephew, who lived in Sodom.
