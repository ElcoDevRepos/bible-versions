In this context, it marks the time after the men of Shechem were circumcised, a painful procedure that left them vulnerable. The number three is frequently seen in Scripture, such as Jonah's three days in the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>), indicating a divine orchestration of events.<p><b>while they were still in pain</b><br>The men of Shechem were incapacitated due to the pain of circumcision, a covenant sign given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). This physical weakness made them defenseless, highlighting the strategic and premeditated nature of Simeon and Levi's actions. The pain also underscores the deceitful nature of the agreement made by Jacob's sons with Hamor and Shechem, exploiting a sacred rite for vengeance.<p><b>two of Jacob&#8217;s sons (Dinah&#8217;s brothers Simeon and Levi)</b><br>Simeon and Levi, as full brothers of Dinah, were particularly incensed by her defilement. Their actions reflect a deep familial loyalty but also a propensity for violence that later affects their tribal inheritances (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). This incident foreshadows the future dispersion of Levi, who becomes the priestly tribe, and Simeon's eventual absorption into Judah.<p><b>took their swords</b><br>The use of swords indicates a premeditated act of violence. In biblical times, swords were common weapons of war and personal defense. The act of taking up swords contrasts with the peaceful intentions that should accompany a covenant sign like circumcision, highlighting the betrayal and moral complexity of their actions.<p><b>went into the unsuspecting city</b><br>The city of Shechem was unsuspecting due to the recent covenant of peace and the physical incapacitation of its men. This element of surprise emphasizes the treachery of Simeon and Levi's actions. Shechem, a significant city in biblical history, later becomes a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>), contrasting its role here as a site of massacre.<p><b>and slaughtered every male</b><br>The complete slaughter of every male in Shechem is an act of retribution for Dinah's defilement. This mirrors other instances of divine judgment in Scripture, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). However, unlike those acts of divine justice, this massacre is driven by human anger and vengeance, raising questions about justice and morality. The severity of their actions leads to Jacob's rebuke and foreshadows the future consequences for their tribes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon_and_levi.htm">Simeon and Levi</a></b><br>Sons of Jacob and Leah, and brothers of Dinah.

And it seems that these two were the leaders in the plot, having probably excluded Reuben from it, as a man of feeble character and opposed to bloodshed (<a href="/genesis/37-22.htm" title="And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand on him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.">Genesis 37:22</a>); and Judah, as one too honourable to take part in so nefarious a transaction. Long afterwards Jacob speaks of it in terms of the strongest reprobation (<a href="/context/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). In executing their cruel deed, they would command the services of the more active and fierce portion of Jacob's servants; but they must have been not boys, but men of ripe manhood, before they could have had influence or power enough for so terrible an exploit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">in their being in pain</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> (LXX.). Inflammation and fever commonly set in on the third day, which was for that reason regarded as the critical day - <span class="cmt_word">that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> sons of the same mother, Leah), <span class="cmt_word">took each man his sword,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and came upon the city</span> - accompanied by their servants (Keil), or their father's men (Murphy), but this is doubtful (Lange). That the other sons of Jacob and brethren of Dinah did not pursue their thirst for vengeance to the same extremity as Simeon and Levi seems apparent from ver. 27; yet it is quite possible that they joined with Simeon and Levi in the assault upon the city (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary') which they made - boldly, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either they themselves feeling confident of success because of the sickness which lay upon the inhabitants (Ainsworth, Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, etc.), or, while the city was lulled into security in consequence of the treaty (Onkelos, Josephus, Keil, Lange), or perhaps referring only to the fact that they encountered no opposition, and came in safety (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) to the city (LXX., Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and slew all the males</span>.
