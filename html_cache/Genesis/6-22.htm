This phrase underscores the importance of complete obedience to God's instructions, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Noah's actions prefigure the obedience of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>). Noah's faith is later commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>, where he is listed among the heroes of faith.<p><b>precisely as God had commanded him.</b><br>The precision with which Noah followed God's commands reflects the meticulous nature of divine instructions, similar to the detailed laws given to Moses for the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-31). This obedience ensured the preservation of life through the Flood, symbolizing salvation through adherence to God's plan. The Ark itself is a type of Christ, providing refuge and salvation from judgment, just as Jesus offers salvation from sin and eternal death (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>).

It signals that what follows is the natural response to God&#8217;s clear revelation.<p>- Scripture often uses such connectors to move from divine instruction to human action (see <a href="/exodus/12-28.htm">Exodus 12:28</a>; <a href="/luke/5-6.htm">Luke 5:6</a>).<p>- The flow reminds us that obedience is not random enthusiasm but a direct answer to what God has already spoken (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Noah</b><p>- God&#8217;s Word singles out Noah by name, underscoring personal responsibility. Salvation and obedience are never crowd projects; they start with an individual who trusts God (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>).<p>- <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a> lists Noah with Daniel and Job as models of righteousness, proving that his life left a legacy far beyond the flood story.<p>- Second Peter 2:5 calls him &#8220;a preacher of righteousness,&#8221; showing that his obedience was public as well as private.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did everything</b><p>- The phrase leaves no room for partial compliance. Like <a href="/joshua/11-15.htm">Joshua 11:15</a> or <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, it describes comprehensive obedience.<p>- Obedience that pleases God is whole-hearted, not selective. Jesus echoed this standard: &#8220;Whoever has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>).<p>- Noah&#8217;s thoroughness stands in stark contrast to the widespread corruption of his generation (<a href="/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>precisely</b><p>- Precision matters when the stakes are eternal. God had given exact measurements for the ark (<a href="/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15-16</a>); Noah matched them detail for detail.<p>- The tabernacle pattern was treated the same way centuries later: &#8220;You must make everything according to the pattern I show you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>).<p>- <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> applies the lesson to us: whatever we do, we are to work at it &#8220;with all our heart, as working for the Lord.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as God had commanded him</b><p>- The standard for Noah&#8217;s actions was not personal preference, popular opinion, or even religious tradition&#8212;it was the direct command of God.<p>- <a href="/genesis/7-5.htm">Genesis 7:5</a> repeats the verdict: &#8220;And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him,&#8221; stressing that his obedience was continuous, not a one-time event.<p>- Jesus modeled and taught the same principle: &#8220;I have kept My Father&#8217;s commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>), and &#8220;His commands are not burdensome&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a> presents Noah as a man who responded to God&#8217;s revealed will with total, exact, personal obedience. The verse links divine command to human action, highlights individual responsibility, celebrates comprehensive and precise compliance, and grounds it all in God&#8217;s authoritative word. For every believer, Noah&#8217;s example still calls us to hear, trust, and obey the Lord in everything&#8212;no shortcuts, no delays, no excuses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus did Noah; according to all that God</span> (Elohim; in <a href="/genesis/7-5.htm">Genesis 7:5</a> it is Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">commanded</span> (with respect to the building of the ark, the receiving of the animals, the collecting of provisions) <span class="cmt_word">him, so did he.</span> <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/6-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Noah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1425;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5146.htm">Strong's 5146: </a> </span><span class="str2">Noah -- 'rest', patriarch who survived the flood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">everything</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1440;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">precisely as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;iw&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">OT Law: Genesis 6:22 Thus Noah did (Gen.
