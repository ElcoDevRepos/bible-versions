The steward here is a key figure in Joseph's household, responsible for managing affairs and serving as an intermediary between Joseph and his brothers. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Egyptian society, where stewards often held significant authority. The brothers' approach to the steward indicates their awareness of protocol and their need to address concerns about the money found in their sacks from their previous visit.<p><b>and spoke to him</b><br>The act of speaking to the steward demonstrates the brothers' anxiety and desire to clear up any misunderstandings regarding the money. In ancient Near Eastern culture, communication with a steward would be a formal affair, as stewards were trusted representatives of their masters. This interaction highlights the brothers' humility and their attempt to ensure goodwill before meeting Joseph.<p><b>at the entrance to the house</b><br>The entrance to Joseph's house symbolizes a threshold between the outside world and the inner workings of Egyptian authority. In biblical narratives, entrances often signify moments of transition or decision. The brothers' conversation at the entrance suggests a moment of anticipation and potential change, as they prepare to face Joseph once more. This setting also underscores the theme of hospitality and the customs surrounding it in ancient times, where guests would be received and their intentions assessed before being allowed further into the home.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who have returned to Egypt to buy grain during the famine.
