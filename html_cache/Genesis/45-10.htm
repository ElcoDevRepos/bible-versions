It was well-suited for grazing and agriculture, making it an ideal place for Jacob's family, who were shepherds. This area provided the Israelites with the resources they needed to thrive during the famine. Theologically, Goshen represents a place of provision and protection, as God orchestrated events to bring Jacob's family to a place where they could grow into a great nation. This settlement also foreshadows the eventual Exodus, as Goshen becomes the starting point for their journey back to the Promised Land.<p><b>and be near me</b><br>Joseph's desire for his family to be near him highlights the restoration of familial relationships and the importance of unity. This closeness allowed Joseph to provide for them during the famine and ensured their safety. It also reflects the biblical theme of reconciliation, as Joseph forgave his brothers for their past wrongs. This nearness can be seen as a type of Christ, who desires closeness with His followers and offers forgiveness and reconciliation.<p><b>you and your children and grandchildren</b><br>The mention of multiple generations emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the importance of family and the transmission of faith and blessings through generations. This generational aspect is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's promises and covenants are often extended to descendants, highlighting the enduring nature of His faithfulness.<p><b>your flocks and herds</b><br>The inclusion of flocks and herds indicates the wealth and livelihood of Jacob's family. In ancient Near Eastern culture, livestock was a primary measure of wealth and essential for survival. This provision ensured that Jacob's family could maintain their way of life and continue to prosper. It also signifies God's provision, as He not only cares for the spiritual needs of His people but also their physical and material needs.<p><b>and everything you own</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the migration to Egypt. Jacob's family was to bring all their possessions, signifying a complete transition and commitment to their new life in Goshen. It reflects the biblical principle of trusting in God's plan and provision, leaving behind the old life for the new. This mirrors the call to believers to leave behind their past and fully commit to following God's leading.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

And here the Israelites were constantly joined by large numbers of Semitic immigrants, who were enrolled in their "tafs," and swelled the rapidly increasing number of their dependants.
