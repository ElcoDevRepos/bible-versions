Altars in the Old Testament were places of sacrifice and communion with God, often marking significant encounters with the divine. This act reflects Jacob's obedience to God's command to return to Bethel (<a href="/genesis/35.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>) and his desire to honor God for His faithfulness. Altars were central to the patriarchal worship practices, serving as tangible reminders of God's presence and promises.<p><b>and he called that place El-bethel</b><br>The name "El-bethel" means "God of Bethel." This naming underscores the importance of the location as a place where God had previously revealed Himself to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). Naming places after divine encounters was a common practice, serving as a memorial for future generations. It highlights the personal relationship between Jacob and God, emphasizing God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob</b><br>This phrase refers to Jacob's earlier encounter with God at Bethel, where he dreamt of a ladder reaching to heaven and received God's promises (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-22</a>). The revelation was a pivotal moment in Jacob's life, marking the beginning of his personal relationship with God. It signifies God's initiative in revealing Himself to humanity and His ongoing guidance and protection over Jacob's life.<p><b>as he fled from his brother</b><br>This context refers to Jacob's flight from Esau, who sought to kill him after Jacob deceived him out of his birthright and blessing (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41-45</a>). The mention of this flight highlights God's protection and providence during a time of fear and uncertainty for Jacob. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to fulfill His purposes despite human conflict and sin. This narrative also foreshadows the reconciliation between Jacob and Esau, illustrating themes of forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who built the altar at El-bethel.

Now, years later, God meets him again after reconciling with Esau (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>); the memory of divine mercy brackets Jacob&#8217;s entire exile.<p>&#8226; Scripture often reminds believers of past deliverance to fuel present faith: Israel&#8217;s Exodus (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>) and David&#8217;s rescue from lions and bears before facing Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a> shows Jacob intentionally memorializing God&#8217;s faithfulness.
