In ancient Egyptian households, stewards were often responsible for managing the master's affairs, indicating Joseph's high level of trust in him. The act of overtaking suggests urgency and authority, as the steward is sent to intercept Joseph's brothers. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the unfolding drama of reconciliation and testing. The steward's actions are part of Joseph's larger plan to test his brothers' integrity and repentance.<p><b>he relayed these words to them</b><br>The words relayed by the steward are a direct command from Joseph, reflecting his authority and the gravity of the situation. This moment is a test of the brothers' honesty and unity, as they are accused of stealing Joseph's silver cup. The steward's message is a catalyst for the brothers' introspection and eventual confession. This scenario echoes earlier biblical themes of testing and revelation, such as God's testing of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.
