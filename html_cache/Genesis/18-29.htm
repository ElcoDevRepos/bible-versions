This dialogue reflects the intimate relationship between Abraham and God, emphasizing the privilege of direct communication with the Divine. The persistence of Abraham in speaking to God demonstrates the importance of perseverance in prayer, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Suppose forty are found there?&#8221;</b><br>Abraham's negotiation with God over the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah shows his deep concern for the righteous within the city. The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or judgment in the Bible, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and the forty years of Israel's wandering in the desert (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). This plea underscores the principle that God is willing to spare judgment for the sake of the righteous, a theme that resonates with the concept of a remnant throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>).<p><b>He answered, &#8220;On account of the forty, I will not do it.&#8221;</b><br>God's response reveals His justice and mercy, willing to withhold judgment if even a small number of righteous people are present. This reflects God's character as described in <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, where He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires repentance. The dialogue foreshadows the ultimate act of mercy through Jesus Christ, who, as the one righteous person, provides salvation for many (<a href="/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18-19</a>). This passage also illustrates the biblical principle that the presence of the righteous can have a preserving effect on society, akin to the role of salt as described in <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
