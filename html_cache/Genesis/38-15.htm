This event occurs after he has left his brothers and settled in the region of Adullam. The context of this passage is significant as it highlights Judah's departure from his family and the resulting moral and spiritual decline. This moment is pivotal in the story of Judah and Tamar, which ultimately leads to the lineage of King David and, prophetically, to Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><b>he thought she was a prostitute</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern culture, prostitution was not uncommon, and women who engaged in it often did so out of economic necessity. The Hebrew term used here can refer to a common prostitute or a cultic prostitute, the latter being associated with pagan religious practices. Judah's assumption reflects the moral and social norms of the time, where such encounters were not unheard of, especially in Canaanite society. This assumption also reveals Judah's own moral state and the influence of the surrounding Canaanite culture.<p><b>because she had covered her face</b><br>Covering the face was a practice that could signify various things in ancient times, including mourning, modesty, or, as in this case, disguise. Tamar's act of covering her face was strategic, allowing her to conceal her identity and fulfill her plan to secure her rights as a widow in Judah's family. This act of covering is significant in the narrative, as it sets the stage for the unfolding events and highlights themes of deception and recognition, which are recurrent in the Genesis narratives. The covering of the face also serves as a literary device, creating dramatic irony as the reader knows Tamar's identity while Judah does not.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a central figure in this account.
