Binding sheaves was a typical activity during harvest time, indicating a time of productivity and provision. The field represents the world or the sphere of human activity. In biblical symbolism, fields often denote places of labor and divine provision (<a href="/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>). The act of binding sheaves can also symbolize gathering and preparation, hinting at future events where Joseph's role in gathering and providing for his family becomes crucial during the famine in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56-57</a>).<p><b>and suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright</b><br>Joseph's sheaf rising and standing upright symbolizes his future elevation and authority over his brothers. This imagery foreshadows Joseph's rise to power in Egypt, where he becomes second only to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>). The suddenness of the sheaf's rising suggests divine intervention and the unexpected nature of God's plans. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also unexpectedly exalted and given authority (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>while your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to mine.</b><br>The act of the brothers' sheaves bowing down to Joseph's sheaf prefigures the fulfillment of Joseph's dreams when his brothers come to Egypt and bow before him, seeking grain during the famine (<a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>). This imagery of bowing signifies submission and acknowledgment of authority. It also reflects the theme of God's sovereignty and the reversal of human expectations, as the younger brother is exalted over the older ones. This theme is echoed in the life of Jesus, who, though rejected by His own, is ultimately recognized as Lord (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who receives dreams from God that foretell his future rise to prominence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who become envious and hostile towards Joseph due to his dreams and their father's favoritism.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents the setting of Joseph's dream, symbolizing the world or the place of labor and harvest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheaves_of_grain.htm">Sheaves of Grain</a></b><br>Symbolic elements in Joseph's dream representing the brothers and their future subservience to Joseph.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Joseph, indicating God's plan for his life and the future dynamics within his family.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_dreams.htm">God's Sovereignty in Dreams</a></b><br>Joseph's dream illustrates how God communicates His plans and purposes, often in ways that are not immediately understood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_humility_and_patience.htm">The Role of Humility and Patience</a></b><br>Joseph's journey from dream to reality required humility and patience, teaching us to trust God's timing and process.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_dynamics_and_god's_plan.htm">Family Dynamics and God's Plan</a></b><br>Despite familial strife and jealousy, God's purposes prevail, reminding us that He can work through difficult relationships for His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Joseph's life encourages believers to remain faithful and steadfast, even when circumstances seem contrary to God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_forgiveness.htm">The Importance of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Joseph's eventual reconciliation with his brothers highlights the power of forgiveness and restoration in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_37_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 37:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joseph_s_dream_future_leader_hint.htm">How does Joseph's dream in Genesis 37:7 foreshadow his future leadership role?
