In the ancient Near Eastern context, such actions were common in warfare, where the victors would take spoils as a sign of dominance. This act of taking possessions reflects the totality of the retribution against the Shechemites, following the defilement of Dinah. The taking of possessions also signifies a transfer of wealth and resources, which was a significant aspect of ancient conflicts.<p><b>and women and children</b><br>The mention of women and children highlights the comprehensive nature of the conquest. In ancient times, capturing women and children was a way to ensure the subjugation of a defeated people, often leading to their assimilation or enslavement. This action underscores the severity of the brothers' response to the violation of their sister. It also reflects the patriarchal and tribal society of the time, where family honor was paramount, and retribution could extend to entire communities.<p><b>and they plundered everything in their houses</b><br>The act of plundering everything in the houses indicates a thorough and systematic stripping of the Shechemites' resources. This phrase emphasizes the complete devastation brought upon the city, leaving nothing of value behind. It serves as a narrative device to illustrate the extent of the brothers' anger and the consequences of Shechem's actions. This plundering can be seen as a precursor to later biblical events where cities are devoted to destruction, such as the conquest of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>.

This action fulfilled their intent to punish the city for violating Dinah (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere shows possessions being seized as spoils of war (<a href="/numbers/31-9.htm">Numbers 31:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-20.htm">1 Samuel 30:20</a>), underscoring that the text records a real historical plundering.<p>&#8226; The verse highlights the totality of the loss: livestock, goods, tools, and wealth left the city in the hands of Jacob&#8217;s sons.<p>&#8226; By taking &#8220;all,&#8221; the brothers left Shechem economically ruined, paralleling later episodes where conquerors strip a place bare (<a href="/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and women and children</b><p>In addition to property, the brothers seized the most vulnerable residents.<p>&#8226;
