The location is traditionally identified as Mount Moriah, which later becomes the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). This connection underscores the significance of the site in biblical history and prophecy, as it becomes a central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites.<p><b>Abraham built the altar there</b><br>Building an altar was a common practice for worship and sacrifice in the ancient Near East. Abraham's action signifies his readiness to worship God through obedience, even in the face of a difficult command. Altars in the Old Testament often symbolize a place of encounter with God, marking significant events in the lives of the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 13</a>:18).<p><b>and arranged the wood</b><br>The careful arrangement of the wood indicates preparation for a burnt offering, a type of sacrifice that involves complete consumption by fire. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the fulfillment of the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<p><b>He bound his son Isaac</b><br>The binding of Isaac, known as the Akedah in Jewish tradition, is a profound act of faith and submission. It prefigures the binding of Jesus, who willingly submitted to the will of the Father (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>). Isaac's willingness to be bound also reflects his trust in Abraham and, by extension, in God's plan.<p><b>and placed him on the altar, atop the wood</b><br>This action symbolizes the ultimate test of faith for Abraham, as he prepares to sacrifice his promised son. It parallels the New Testament narrative of God offering His only Son, Jesus, as a sacrifice for humanity's sins (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The imagery of Isaac on the altar points to the substitutionary atonement of Christ, who takes the place of sinners on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

sovereignty shines through: the spot was not chosen by Abraham but by God Himself, echoing how the Lord later chose Mount Moriah for the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s immediate obedience demonstrates faith without hesitation, reminiscent of Noah building the ark &#8220;exactly as God commanded&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This location underscores God&#8217;s foresight; centuries later, Jesus would be crucified in this same region, fulfilling the pattern of substitution (<a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood</b><p>&#8226; Building an altar involved effort and intentionality; Abraham&#8217;s actions show worship that costs something, paralleling David&#8217;s refusal to offer sacrifices that cost him nothing (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The careful arrangement of wood reflects ordered worship, anticipating the Levitical sacrificial system where priests &#8220;arranged the wood on the fire&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s personal involvement&#8212;no servants assisting&#8212;highlights that genuine devotion cannot be delegated (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He bound his son Isaac</b><p>&#8226; Isaac, likely a strong youth, submits willingly, foreshadowing Christ who

required for sacrifice; nothing is held back, matching Paul&#8217;s call to be &#8220;crucified with Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment tests both

redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s act affirms that God&#8217;s promises, including the covenant line through Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>), are secure even when

Abraham follows God to the exact place, builds an altar with care, binds his willing son Isaac, and lays him on the wood&#8212;every detail pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The verse teaches that authentic faith trusts God&#8217;s word fully, worships Him reverently, and anticipates His redemptive provision even when the path seems impossible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Abraham . . . bound Isaac</span>.--Jewish commentators agree that this was done with Isaac's consent, nor could it well have been otherwise.
