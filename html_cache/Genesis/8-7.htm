The raven, an unclean bird according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>), is sent out first. Ravens are known for their scavenging nature, which may symbolize the ongoing presence of death and decay outside the ark. The choice of a raven, rather than a dove initially, may reflect the incomplete state of the earth's restoration. This act of sending out the raven can be seen as a test to determine the condition of the earth, as ravens can survive on carrion and would not necessarily return if they found food.<p><b>It kept flying back and forth</b><br>The phrase suggests a continuous action, indicating that the raven did not find a place to settle. This behavior reflects the ongoing desolation of the earth post-flood. The raven's flight back and forth can symbolize the restlessness and lack of peace in a world still under judgment. In a broader biblical context, this restlessness can be contrasted with the peace and rest found in God, as seen in the symbolism of the dove later in the chapter.<p><b>until the waters had dried up from the earth.</b><br>This phrase marks the transition from judgment to restoration. The drying of the waters signifies God's mercy and the beginning of a new creation. Theologically, it parallels the creation narrative where God separates the waters to create dry land (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). The drying up of the waters can also be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing cleansing and renewal. In prophetic terms, it foreshadows the ultimate restoration of creation, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where a new heaven and a new earth are established, free from the chaos of the sea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.
