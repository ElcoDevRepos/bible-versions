The shedding of blood refers to murder, an act that violates the divine order. The context is post-flood, where God is re-establishing His covenant with Noah and setting forth laws for humanity. This principle is foundational for the establishment of human justice systems and reflects the seriousness of taking a life, as seen in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p><b>by man his blood will be shed;</b><br>This introduces the concept of human responsibility in executing justice. It implies the establishment of human governance and the authority to administer capital punishment. This reflects the idea of retributive justice, which is echoed in the law of "an eye for an eye" (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). It underscores the role of human institutions in maintaining order and justice, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>).<p><b>for in His own image God has made mankind.</b><br>This phrase highlights the theological basis for the sanctity of life: humans are made in the image of God (Imago Dei). This concept, first introduced in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, affirms the inherent dignity and worth of every person. It serves as a reminder of humanity's unique role in creation and the moral responsibilities that come with it. The image of God in humanity is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, pointing to the ultimate restoration of this image through Jesus Christ (<a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes the covenant with Noah and humanity, emphasizing the sanctity of human life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The recipient of God's covenant, representing humanity post-flood, tasked with repopulating and stewarding the earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Created in the image of God, highlighting the inherent value and dignity of human life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flood.htm">The Flood</a></b><br>A significant event preceding this command, where God judged the earth for its violence and corruption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise and set of instructions given to Noah, establishing a new order for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_human_life.htm">Sanctity of Human Life</a></b><br>Human life is sacred because it is made in the image of God.
