The term "had relations" is a euphemism for sexual intercourse, highlighting the intimate union between husband and wife as ordained by God in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. This act fulfills God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The marital relationship between Adam and Eve sets a precedent for the sanctity of marriage and family in biblical teaching.<p><b>and she conceived and gave birth to Cain</b><br>Eve's conception and the birth of Cain mark the beginning of human history outside the Garden of Eden. Cain's name is significant; it sounds like the Hebrew word for "acquired" or "gotten," reflecting Eve's acknowledgment of God's role in the process of life. This event introduces the theme of sibling rivalry and sin's consequences, as Cain later becomes the first murderer. The birth of Cain also foreshadows the ongoing struggle between good and evil, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,&#8221; she said</b><br>Eve's statement recognizes God's sovereignty and assistance in the process of childbirth. Her acknowledgment of the LORD (Yahweh) indicates a personal relationship with God, despite the fall. This phrase can be seen as an expression of faith and gratitude. The reference to "a man" may also hint at the anticipation of the promised seed in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, though Cain ultimately does not fulfill this role. This expectation of a deliverer is a recurring theme, culminating in the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, husband to Eve, and father to Cain and Abel.

To tillage and a pastoral life they added metallurgy and music; and the knowledge not only of copper and its uses, but even of iron (<a href="/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>), must have given them a command over the resources of nature so great as to have vastly diminished the curse of labour, and made their lives easy and luxurious.<p><span class= "bld">I have gotten a man from the Lord.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">who is Jehovah. </span>It is inconceivable that <span class= "ital">eth </span>should have here a different meaning from that which it has in <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>. It there gives emphasis to the object of the verb: "God created <span class= "ital">eth </span>the heaven and <span class= "ital">eth </span>the earth," that is, <span class= "ital">even the heaven and even the earth. </span>So also here, "I have gotten a man <span class= "ital">eth </span>Jehovah." <span class= "ital">even Jehovah. </span>The objection that this implies too advanced a knowledge of Messianic ideas is unfounded. It is we who read backward, and put our ideas into the words of the narrative. These words were intended to lead on to those ideas, but they were at present only as the germ, or as the filament in the acorn which contains the oak-tree. If there is one thing certain, it is that religious knowledge was given gradually, and that the significance of the name Jehovah was revealed by slow degrees. (See on <a href="/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>.) Eve attached no notion of divinity to the name; still less did she foresee that by the superstition of the Jews the title Lord would be substituted for it. We distinctly know that Jehovah was not even the patriarchal name of the Deity (<a href="/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a>), and still less could it have been God's title in Paradise. But Eve had received the promise that her seed should crush the head of her enemy, and to this promise her words referred, and the title in her mouth meant probably no more than "the coming One." Apparently, too, it was out of Eve's words that this most significant title of the covenant God arose. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>on names <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>and <span class= "ital">Jehovah-Elohim, </span>at end of this book.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Exiled from Eden, o'er, canopied by grace, animated by hope, assured of the Divine forgiveness, and filled with a sweet peace, the first pair enter on their life experience of labor and sorrow, and the human race begins its onward course of development in sight of the mystic cherubim and flaming sword. <span class="cmt_word">And Adam knew Eve, his wife</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "recognized her nature and uses" (Alford; cf. <a href="/numbers/31-17.htm">Numbers 31:17</a>). The act here mentioned is recorded not to indicate that paradise was "non nuptiis, sed virginitate destinatum" (Jerome), but to show that while Adam was formed from the soil, and Eve from a rib taken from his side, the other members of the race were to be produced "neque ex terra neque quovis alio mode, sed ex conjunctione maris et foeminse" (Rungius). <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived</span>. The Divine blessing (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), which in its operation had been suspended during the period of innocence, while yet it was undetermined whether the race should develop as a holy or a fallen seed, now begins to take effect (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bare Cain</span>. <span class="accented">Acquisition</span> or <span class="accented">Possession</span>, <span class="accented">from kanah</span>, to acquire (Gesenius).

Tayler Lewis falls back upon the primitive idea of the root, to create, to procreate, generate, of which he cites as examples <a href="/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, and takes the derivative to signify the <span class="accented">seed</span>, explaining Eve's exclamation <span class="accented">kanithi kain as</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">genui genitum</span> or <span class="accented">generationem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And said, I have gotten a man from the Lord</span>. The popular interpretation, regarding <span class="accented">kani-thi</span> as the emphatic word in the sentence, understands Eve to say that her child was a thing achieved, an acquisition gained, either from the Lord (Onkelos, Calvin) or by means of, with the help of, the Lord (LXX., Vulgate, Jerome, Dathe, Keil), or for the Lord (Syriac). If, however, the emphatic term is Jehovah, then <span class="accented">eth</span> with Makkeph following will be the sign of the accusative, and the sense will be, "I have gotten a man - Jehovah" (Jonathon, Luther, Baumgarten, Lewis); to which, perhaps, the chief objections are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it appears to anticipate the development of the Messianic idea, and credits Eve with too mature Christological conceptions (Lange), though if Enoch in the seventh generation recognized Jehovah as the coming One, why might not Eve have done so in the first?
