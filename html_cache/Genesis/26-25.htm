Altars were often constructed at significant locations where God revealed Himself or provided guidance. This act by Isaac echoes the actions of his father, Abraham, who also built altars to the Lord (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 13</a>:18). It demonstrates Isaac's commitment to maintaining the faith and practices of his forefathers. The altar signifies a place of sacrifice and communion with God, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<p><b>and called on the name of the LORD</b><br>Calling on the name of the LORD indicates a personal relationship and communication with God. It reflects a deep trust and reliance on God's promises and faithfulness. This phrase is reminiscent of earlier patriarchs, such as Abraham and Noah, who also called upon the Lord (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 4</a>:26). It signifies worship, prayer, and the invocation of God's presence and blessing. This act of calling on the Lord is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of calling on the name of Jesus for salvation (<a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>, <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p><b>and he pitched his tent there</b><br>Pitching a tent symbolizes a temporary dwelling and a nomadic lifestyle, which was typical for the patriarchs. It reflects the transient nature of life on earth and the anticipation of a permanent home, as later emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>. This act also signifies Isaac's intention to settle in the land God promised to his descendants, showing obedience and trust in God's covenant. The tent can be seen as a type of the tabernacle, a temporary dwelling place for God's presence among His people.<p><b>His servants also dug a well there</b><br>Wells were vital for survival in the arid regions of the Near East, providing necessary water for people and livestock. Digging a well signifies establishing a permanent presence in the land and God's provision for Isaac and his household. Wells often became points of contention, as seen earlier in <a href="/genesis/26.htm">Genesis 26</a>, symbolizing the struggle for resources and God's faithfulness in providing for His people. The well can also be seen as a type of the living water that Jesus offers, as mentioned in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, pointing to spiritual sustenance and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of the Israelite nation.
