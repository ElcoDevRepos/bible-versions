The narrative of <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a> is set within the larger story of Joseph, providing a contrast between Judah's moral failings and Joseph's righteousness. The birth of twins is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing conflict or competition, as seen with Jacob and Esau.<p><b>with the scarlet thread around his wrist</b><br>The scarlet thread was tied around Zerah's wrist by the midwife to mark him as the firstborn, as he initially put out his hand before Perez was born. The use of a scarlet thread is symbolic and appears elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the story of Rahab (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18</a>), where it signifies protection and redemption. The color scarlet often represents sin and redemption (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p><b>and he was named Zerah</b><br>The name Zerah means "brightness" or "dawning," which can symbolize hope or a new beginning. In the genealogical records, Zerah's descendants are mentioned among the tribes of Judah (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-4.htm">1 Chronicles 2:4, 6</a>). The naming of Zerah, despite not being the firstborn, highlights the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing leaders and fulfilling His promises, as seen in the lineage of Christ through Perez (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerah.htm">Zerah</a></b><br>The second son of Judah and Tamar, who was born with a scarlet thread tied around his hand.
