At this point in Genesis, Isaac is elderly and nearly blind. The context of this passage is the blessing of the firstborn, a significant event in ancient Near Eastern culture, where the father would bestow a special blessing on his eldest son. Isaac's intention was to bless Esau, his firstborn, but through Rebekah's intervention, Jacob is in Esau's place. This moment is pivotal in the unfolding of God's covenant promises, as it leads to Jacob receiving the blessing that would traditionally belong to Esau.<p><b>&#8220;Please come near</b><br>The request for proximity is significant in the context of Isaac's blindness. He relies on his other senses to identify his son. This moment is filled with tension, as Jacob, disguised as Esau, approaches his father. The act of coming near also symbolizes the intimacy and personal nature of the blessing being given. In biblical times, physical closeness was often associated with the transmission of blessings and covenants.<p><b>and kiss me, my son.&#8221;</b><br>A kiss in ancient cultures was a common gesture of affection and respect, often used in familial relationships. It was also a sign of submission and loyalty. In this context, the kiss serves as a means for Isaac to confirm the identity of his son through touch and smell, as he later remarks on the scent of Jacob's garments, which were Esau's. This act of deception by Jacob is a critical moment in the narrative, as it leads to him receiving the blessing meant for Esau. The kiss can also be seen as a type of betrayal, reminiscent of Judas' kiss to Jesus in the New Testament, highlighting themes of deception and the fulfillment of divine purposes through human actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.
