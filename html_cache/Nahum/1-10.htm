Thorns in biblical literature often symbolize sin, difficulty, and divine judgment (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>). The imagery of being entangled with thorns indicates the Assyrians' impending doom, as they are caught in their own wickedness and unable to escape God's judgment. Historically, the Assyrians were known for their cruelty and oppression, and this prophecy foretells their downfall as a result of their actions.<p><b>and consumed like the drink of a drunkard&#8212;</b><br>The comparison to a drunkard's drink implies a state of vulnerability and lack of control. In biblical times, drunkenness was often associated with moral and spiritual decay (<a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-35</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>). This imagery suggests that the Assyrians will be overwhelmed and destroyed in a manner similar to how alcohol overtakes a drunkard, leading to their downfall. The consumption here indicates total destruction, as the Assyrians will be unable to resist the divine judgment that is coming upon them.<p><b>like stubble that is fully dry.</b><br>Stubble, the dry remains of harvested grain, is highly flammable and easily consumed by fire. This metaphor emphasizes the complete and swift destruction that awaits the Assyrians. In biblical context, stubble often represents something that is worthless and destined for destruction (<a href="/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>, <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). The imagery of dry stubble highlights the inevitability and thoroughness of God's judgment. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of divine retribution against those who oppose God's will, underscoring the certainty of the Assyrians' fate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet who delivered God's message of judgment against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, known for its cruelty and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of the Assyrian Empire, notorious for its wickedness and eventual destruction as prophesied by Nahum.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrians.htm">Assyrians</a></b><br>The people of Nineveh, representing the enemies of Israel and symbolizing those who oppose God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thorns.htm">Thorns</a></b><br>Symbolic of entanglement and difficulty, representing the inescapable judgment that will ensnare the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/drunkard.htm">Drunkard</a></b><br>A metaphor for those who are oblivious to their impending doom, consumed by their own excesses and sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Inevitability of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>Just as thorns entangle and stubble is easily consumed, God's judgment is certain and inescapable for those who oppose Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_spiritual_intoxication.htm">The Dangers of Spiritual Intoxication</a></b><br>Like a drunkard unaware of his peril, those who indulge in sin become oblivious to their spiritual danger.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_spiritual_sobriety.htm">The Call to Spiritual Sobriety</a></b><br>Believers are urged to remain vigilant and sober-minded, avoiding the entanglements of sin and the distractions of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The fall of Nineveh serves as a reminder that no nation or power is beyond God's control and judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_the_righteous.htm">Hope for the Righteous</a></b><br>While the wicked face destruction, those who trust in the Lord can find refuge and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Nahum_1_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Nahum 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nahum_1_10_God_s_power_vs_enemies_plans.htm">How does Nahum 1:10 illustrate God's power over His enemies' plans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_do_thorns_symbolize_for_the_wicked.htm">What does "entangled among thorns" symbolize about the fate of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Nahum_1_10_Hope_for_believers_today.htm">How can Nahum 1:10 encourage believers facing opposition today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Nahum_1_10_vs_Psalm_37_20_wicked_s_fate.htm">Compare Nahum 1:10 with Psalm 37:20 regarding the fate of the wicked.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Nahum_1_10_s_impact_on_trust_in_God.htm">How should Nahum 1:10 influence our trust in God's justice and protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_Nahum_1_10_elements.htm">What does Nahum 1:10 symbolize with "entangled thorns" and "drunken drinkers"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Nahum_1_10_God_s_judgment_on_Nineveh.htm">How does Nahum 1:10 reflect God's judgment on Nineveh?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Events_matching_Nahum_1_10_prophecy.htm">What historical events align with the prophecy in Nahum 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_nahum_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Nahum 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/endure_hardship_like_christ's_soldier.htm">How can you endure hardship like a soldier of Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_isaiah_47_14_prophecy.htm">Isaiah 47:14 -

The verse assures God&#8217;s people that no oppressor, however formidable, can outmaneuver or outlast the Almighty. His justice is certain, thorough, and perfectly timed, and those who trust Him can rest in that unshakable truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nahum/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">For while.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">For they shall be even as bundles of thorn fagots, and even while steeped in their drink they shall be burnt up like stubble fully dry.</span> Dry thorn cuttings were commonly used as fuel. (See <a href="/psalms/58-9.htm" title="Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.">Psalm 58:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-12.htm" title="They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.">Psalm 118:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm" title="For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>.) The verse compares the victims of Jehovah's wrath, first, to a compact bundle of thorn fagots; secondly, to a material equally combustible, the dry straw and stubble of the threshing-floor. With regard to the words "while steeped in their drink," it may be remarked that in the final siege of Nineveh a great defeat of its forces was effected by a surprise while the king and his captains were sunk in revelry (Diod. Sic. ii. 26). Benhadad, king of Syria, and Belshazzar, king of Babylon, were overcome under similar circumstances (<a href="/1_kings/1-16.htm" title="And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What would you?">1Kings 1:16</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/5-1.htm" title="Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.">Daniel 5:1-30</a>). Feasting and revelry may have gone on in Sennacherib's camp at the moment when the sudden visitation of the "angel of the Lord" was impending; but on this point we have no information. The introduction of this detail adds to the metaphor a certain grim humour. Soaked in wine though the enemy be, he shall surely burn like driest fuel in the day of Jehovah's fiery wrath. The opening clause of the verse is beset with difficulties, both grammatical and lexical. Kleinert renders "For in thorns they shall be entangled," &c.; Ewald and Hitzig, "For even though they be compact as a wickerwork of thorns," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While they be folden together as thorns.</span> The clause is conditional: "Though they be interwined as thorns." Though the Assyrians present an impenetrable front, which seems to defy attack. (For the comparison of a hostile army to briers and thorns, see <a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>; Henderson.) <span class="cmt_word">And while they are drunken as drunkards</span>; <span class="accented">and though they be drunken with their drink</span>, regarding themselves as invincible, and drenched with wine, and given up to luxury and excess. There may be an allusion to the legend current concerning the destruction of Nineveh. Diodorus (2:26) relates that, after the enemy had been thrice repulsed, the King of Nineveh was so elated that he gave himself up to festivity, and allowed all his army to indulge in the utmost licence, and that it was while they were occupied in drunkenness and feasting they were surprised by the Medes under Cyaxares, and their city taken. An account of such a feast, accompanied with sketehes from the monuments, is given in Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Discoveries,' p. 187, etc. We may compare the fate of Belshazzar (<a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry;</span> like worthless refuse, fit only for burning (<a href="/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>).
