In the historical context, Assyria was known for its powerful and organized military structure, with nobles often serving as commanders or high-ranking officials. The summoning of nobles suggests urgency and the need for leadership in the face of impending danger. This reflects the broader theme of divine judgment against Nineveh, as prophesied by Nahum, where even the mightiest leaders are rendered powerless.<p><b>they stumble as they advance.</b><br>The imagery of stumbling conveys chaos and disarray among the Assyrian forces. This could symbolize the confusion and panic that ensues when God's judgment is upon a nation. The stumbling of the nobles, despite their status and experience, highlights the futility of human efforts against divine will. This can be connected to other biblical instances where God causes confusion among enemy ranks, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a> during the pursuit of the Israelites by the Egyptians.<p><b>They race to its wall;</b><br>The urgency in racing to the wall suggests a defensive maneuver, indicating that the city is under siege. In ancient warfare, city walls were crucial for protection, and defending them was a priority. This reflects the historical context of Nineveh's fall, where the city's defenses were ultimately breached. The phrase underscores the desperation and haste of the Assyrian forces as they attempt to protect their stronghold.<p><b>the protective shield is set in place.</b><br>The setting of the protective shield refers to the use of large shields or mantlets in ancient warfare to protect soldiers from enemy attacks, particularly during sieges. This detail highlights the defensive preparations taken by the Assyrians. However, despite these efforts, the prophecy foretells their downfall, emphasizing the theme of inevitable divine judgment. The protective shield, while a symbol of human defense, is ultimately ineffective against God's decreed destruction of Nineveh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/he.htm">He (The Assyrian King)</a></b><br>The verse refers to the Assyrian king, likely Sennacherib or one of his successors, who is summoning his nobles in a time of crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nobles.htm">Nobles</a></b><br>These are the high-ranking officials or military leaders of Assyria, who are called to action in defense of the city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall.htm">The Wall</a></b><br>Represents the fortifications of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, which is under threat of attack.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/protective_shield.htm">Protective Shield</a></b><br>A defensive measure used in ancient warfare, possibly referring to a large shield or a formation used to protect the city from invaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stumbling.htm">Stumbling</a></b><br>This action indicates a sense of urgency and disarray among the Assyrian forces, suggesting a lack of preparedness or divine intervention against them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_on_pride.htm">Divine Judgment on Pride</a></b><br>The stumbling of the nobles signifies God's judgment on the pride and arrogance of Assyria.

The Assyrian king bethinks him of his stoutest warriors, but they <span class= "ital">stumble in their paths</span> in nervous perplexity. Men ran to the city wall, but against it the besiegers have already erected their storming-shed--a proceeding which ought to have been prevented by the discharge of stones and other missiles from the walls. The storming-shed protected the battering-rams. Of the representations of these preserved in the monuments of Nineveh, Professor Rawlinson thus writes: "All of them were covered with a framework, which was of osier wood, felt, or skins, for the better protection of those who worked the implement. . . . Some appear to have been stationary, others provided with wheels. . . . Again, sometimes combined with the ram and its framework was a movable tower containing soldiers, who at once fought the enemy on a level, and protected the engine from their attacks (<span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> i. 470).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The prophet turns to the Ninevites and their preparations for defence. <span class="cmt_word">He shall recount his worthies;</span> <span class="accented">he remembers his nobles.</span> The King of Nineveh calls to mind the mighty captains who have often led his armies to victory, and sends them to defend the walls (comp. <a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>).

They see the besiegers bringing up their mantelets and towers. As used by the Assyrians, the machine called "the covering" is either a wooden tower or a wicker mantelet in which was suspended a battering ram. It stood on four or six wheels, and the larger sort had archers posted in the various stories, both to annoy the enemy and to defend the engine. The rams were provided with lance headed extremities, and must have rather picked at and loosened the courses of bricks of which the walls were composed than battered them down (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 160, 234, 243, etc. Layard, 'Nineveh,' ch. 5. p. 376, etc., figs. 57, 58).
