The concept of God being "slow to anger" is echoed in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God reveals His character to Moses. This patience is not to be mistaken for indifference; rather, it is an opportunity for repentance. God's "great power" is evident throughout Scripture, from the creation narrative in Genesis to the miracles of Jesus in the New Testament. His power is both creative and destructive, capable of bringing life and executing judgment.<p><b>the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.</b><br>This assures that divine justice will prevail. While God is patient, He is also just, and His justice demands accountability. This is consistent with the biblical theme that sin has consequences, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The phrase underscores the certainty of judgment for the unrepentant, aligning with the prophetic messages throughout the Old Testament, such as in Isaiah and Jeremiah, where nations and individuals are held accountable for their actions.<p><b>His path is in the whirlwind and storm,</b><br>This imagery conveys God's sovereignty over nature and His use of it as an instrument of judgment. The whirlwind and storm symbolize God's powerful and sometimes unpredictable interventions in human affairs. This is reminiscent of God's appearance to Job in the whirlwind (<a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38:1</a>), where He demonstrates His control over creation. The natural elements serve as a metaphor for God's overwhelming presence and His ability to disrupt the status quo to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.</b><br>This phrase poetically illustrates God's majesty and transcendence. The clouds, often associated with divine presence (as in the pillar of cloud in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), signify His glory and the mystery surrounding Him. The imagery of clouds as "dust" suggests that even the grandest elements of nature are but a small part of His creation, emphasizing His supremacy. This can be connected to the New Testament depiction of Jesus' return in the clouds (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>), symbolizing divine authority and fulfillment of prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's character and actions. Yahweh is depicted as both patient and powerful, embodying justice and authority over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message. Nahum's prophecy is primarily directed against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, which was known for its wickedness and oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The city that is the focus of Nahum's prophecy. It was a major city in the Assyrian Empire, known for its cruelty and idolatry, and is ultimately subject to God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/whirlwind_and_storm.htm">Whirlwind and Storm</a></b><br>Natural phenomena used metaphorically to describe God's power and presence. These elements signify God's ability to control and use creation to fulfill His purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/clouds.htm">Clouds</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's majesty and transcendence.

He does not erupt at the first sign of rebellion, but gives time for repentance. As <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and truth.&#8221;<p>- Jonah discovered this quality when Nineveh repented (<a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), and Peter repeats it for our age, &#8220;The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise&#8230; but is patient with you&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>- His forbearance is not approval of sin; it is opportunity. <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> warns that despising this kindness stores up wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Great in power</b><p>- Patience is never weakness.

The clouds are the dust of his feet, Large and grand as the clouds look to us, they are to God but as the dust raised by the feet in walking. As an illustration of this statement (though, of course, the fact was utterly unknown to Nahum), it has been remarked that recent scientific discovery asserts that clouds owe their beauty, and even their very existence, to the presence of dust particles in the atmosphere.
