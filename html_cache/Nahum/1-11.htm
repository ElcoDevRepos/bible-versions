It was a city of immense wealth and influence, but also notorious for its cruelty and idolatry. The mention of Nineveh here is significant as it represents the heart of Assyrian power and opposition to God. Historically, Nineveh was a center of pagan worship and a symbol of human pride and rebellion against God. The city had previously repented at the preaching of Jonah, but by Nahum's time, it had returned to its wicked ways.<p><b>comes forth a plotter of evil against the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates that from Nineveh, there arises an individual or group that actively devises plans against God. The Assyrians were known for their military campaigns and oppressive tactics, often seen as direct challenges to God's sovereignty. This plotting of evil can be understood as both literal military aggression and spiritual rebellion. The Assyrians had a history of attacking God's people, as seen in their siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah (2 Kings 18-19).<p><b>a counselor of wickedness</b><br>The term "counselor" suggests someone in a position of authority or influence, providing guidance that leads to evil actions. This could refer to Assyrian leaders or advisors who encouraged policies and actions contrary to God's will. The wickedness here is not just moral corruption but also encompasses the broader defiance against God's plans and purposes. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of the futility of human wisdom when it opposes divine wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>, "There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its great power and also its wickedness.
