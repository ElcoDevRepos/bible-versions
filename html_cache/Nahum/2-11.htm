The lion symbolizes power and ferocity, common imagery in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Assyria was a formidable empire, often compared to a lion due to its military prowess and conquests. The rhetorical question implies the impending downfall of this once mighty empire, suggesting that its secure "lair" will be no more.<p><b>or the feeding ground of the young lions</b><br>The "feeding ground" represents the territories and wealth that Assyria plundered and controlled. The "young lions" symbolize the Assyrian rulers and warriors who benefited from the empire's conquests. This imagery highlights the prosperity and security Assyria enjoyed at the expense of other nations. The question suggests that this prosperity will soon vanish, as divine judgment approaches.<p><b>where the lion and lioness prowled with their cubs</b><br>The "lion and lioness" symbolize the king and queen of Assyria, while the "cubs" represent their offspring or the next generation of rulers. This imagery conveys a sense of familial strength and continuity in leadership. However, the prophecy indicates that this royal lineage will be disrupted, and their dominion will cease. The Assyrian royal family, once secure and unchallenged, will face destruction.<p><b>with nothing to frighten them away?</b><br>This phrase underscores the previous security and fearlessness of the Assyrian empire. Historically, Assyria was a dominant force, often unchallenged by neighboring nations. The rhetorical question implies a dramatic change, as the once fearless empire will now face divine retribution. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God judges and humbles proud empires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its power and cruelty.
