In the context of Nahum, the flood is symbolic of God's wrath and judgment against Nineveh. Historically, Nineveh was situated near the Tigris River, and the city was vulnerable to flooding. This imagery may also allude to the literal flooding that contributed to Nineveh's downfall. The flood represents God's ability to bring about His purposes through natural means. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>, where God uses a flood to judge the earth, and in <a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>, where the days of Noah are compared to the coming of the Son of Man.<p><b>He will make an end of Nineveh</b><br>Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its great power and cruelty. The prophecy of its end was significant because Assyria was a dominant force in the ancient Near East. The fall of Nineveh in 612 BC fulfilled this prophecy, as the city was destroyed by a coalition of Babylonians, Medes, and others. This demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to bring down even the mightiest empires. The destruction of Nineveh serves as a warning to all nations that oppose God and His people.<p><b>and pursue His enemies into darkness</b><br>The imagery of darkness signifies judgment, confusion, and the absence of God's presence. Pursuing enemies into darkness implies a complete and inescapable judgment. This phrase highlights God's active role in seeking out and punishing those who oppose Him. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a righteous judge who will not allow wickedness to go unpunished. This concept is seen throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11-12</a>, where darkness cannot hide from God, and in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>, where those who do evil hate the light and do not come to it. The ultimate fulfillment of God's judgment against His enemies is seen in the final judgment described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet who delivered God's message of judgment against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of the Assyrian Empire, known for its wickedness and cruelty, which God declared would be destroyed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who judges nations and protects His people, demonstrating His power and justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrians.htm">Assyrians</a></b><br>The people of Nineveh, known for their oppressive and violent ways, who are the recipients of God's impending judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/overwhelming_flood.htm">Overwhelming Flood</a></b><br>A metaphorical or literal representation of God's judgment, signifying complete destruction and the inescapability of His wrath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their destinies.

But it is better rendered, He <span class="accented">shall pursue his enemies into darkness</span>, so that they disappear from the earth. If this is the meaning of the clause, it resembles the termination of many Assyrian inscriptions which record the defeat of a hostile chieftain: "and no one has seen any trace of him since." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nahum/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But with an overflowing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">flood,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1496;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#353;e&#183;&#7789;ep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7858.htm">Strong's 7858: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flood -- a deluge</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He will make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3617.htm">Strong's 3617: </a> </span><span class="str2">Completion, complete destruction, consumption, annihilation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[of Nineveh]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4725.htm">Strong's 4725: </a> </span><span class="str2">A standing, a spot, a condition</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and pursue</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1507;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;rad&#183;dep&#772;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7291.htm">Strong's 7291: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pursue, chase, persecute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His enemies</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_341.htm">Strong's 341: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hating, an adversary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into darkness.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2822.htm">Strong's 2822: </a> </span><span class="str2">The dark, darkness, misery, destruction, death, ignorance, sorrow, wickedness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">OT Prophets: Nahum 1:8 But with an overflowing flood he will (Nah.
