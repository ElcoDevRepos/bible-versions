The city was strategically located on the Tigris River, contributing to its prosperity and making it a center of trade and culture. Historically, Nineveh was a symbol of Assyrian dominance, having been a formidable force in the ancient Near East. The imagery of a "pool of water" suggests stability and abundance, reflecting the city's long-standing prominence and security.<p><b>but now it is draining away</b><br>This phrase signifies the impending downfall and desolation of Nineveh. The once stable and prosperous city is now experiencing a rapid decline, akin to water draining from a pool. This imagery conveys the idea of loss and emptiness, as the city's resources, power, and people are being depleted. The prophecy foretells the end of Nineveh's dominance, aligning with the historical event of its destruction by the Babylonians and Medes in 612 BC. This serves as a fulfillment of divine judgment against the city for its wickedness and cruelty, as previously prophesied by Nahum.<p><b>&#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; they cry</b><br>The cry to "Stop! Stop!" reflects the desperation and panic of Nineveh's inhabitants as they witness the city's downfall. It indicates a futile attempt to halt the inevitable destruction and chaos. This cry can be seen as a metaphor for the resistance against God's judgment, highlighting the helplessness of those who oppose His will. The repetition emphasizes the urgency and fear experienced by the people as their once-great city collapses around them.<p><b>but no one turns back</b><br>Despite the cries for help and the desire to stop the destruction, there is no response or reversal of the situation. This phrase underscores the inevitability of Nineveh's fate and the completeness of God's judgment. It also reflects the idea that the people are unable or unwilling to repent and turn back to God, resulting in their ultimate downfall. This can be connected to other biblical themes of judgment and repentance, where the refusal to heed divine warnings leads to destruction, as seen in the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah or the warnings given to Israel and Judah by the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its great power and wealth, but also for its wickedness and cruelty.

A panic thereupon seizes the inhabitants. If the present text be maintained, the rendering of the Authorised Version will stand. We may then suppose the heterogeneous population of Nineveh to be compared to "countless drops, full, untroubled, with no ebb or flow, fenced in from the days that she hath been, yet even therefore stagnant and corrupted; not 'a fountain of living waters'" (Pusey). But this appears to us a farfetched comparison.<p>The pregnant terseness of the last part of the verse will give the English reader a good idea of Nahum's style and the difficulties therewith connected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The prophet compares the past and present condition of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water;</span> <span class="accented">and</span> (or, <span class="accented">though</span>) <span class="accented">Nineveh hath been like a pool of water all her days.</span> Others, altering the points in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate, translate, "But as for Nineveh, her waters are like a pool of water."
