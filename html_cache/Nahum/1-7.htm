The goodness of the LORD is a foundational attribute, seen in His creation (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>) and His dealings with humanity. In the context of Nahum, this declaration contrasts with the judgment pronounced on Nineveh, highlighting that God's actions are rooted in His righteous nature. The goodness of God is also a source of comfort and assurance for believers, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, which invites people to "taste and see that the LORD is good."<p><b>a stronghold in the day of distress</b><br>The imagery of God as a stronghold conveys protection and security. In ancient times, a stronghold was a fortified place offering refuge from enemies. This metaphor is used throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>) to describe God's protective power. The "day of distress" refers to times of trouble or adversity, which were common in the turbulent history of Israel and Judah. This assurance of divine protection is a recurring theme, providing hope and stability for those facing trials.<p><b>He cares for those who trust in Him</b><br>This phrase underscores the personal relationship between God and His people. The Hebrew word for "cares" can also be translated as "knows," indicating an intimate, covenantal relationship. Trust in God is a key aspect of faith, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which encourages believers to trust in the LORD with all their heart. This trust is not passive but involves active reliance on God's character and promises. The assurance that God cares for those who trust in Him is a source of comfort and encouragement, affirming that He is attentive to the needs and struggles of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet who delivered God's message of judgment against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, known for its wickedness and oppression of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, characterized by His goodness and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The city that Nahum prophesied against, representing the enemies of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people of God who are assured of His protection and care amidst their distress.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_distress.htm">Day of Distress</a></b><br>A time of trouble or calamity, often experienced by God's people due to external threats or divine discipline.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_goodness.htm">God's Goodness</a></b><br>Recognize that God's nature is inherently good, and His actions towards us are always for our benefit.<br><br>Trust in His goodness even when circumstances seem unfavorable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_a_stronghold.htm">God as a Stronghold</a></b><br>In times of distress, seek refuge in God, who is a reliable and unshakeable fortress.<br><br>Develop a habit of turning to God first in times of trouble rather than relying solely on human solutions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_and_care.htm">Trust and Care</a></b><br>Understand that God's care is conditional upon our trust in Him.
