In the ancient Near East, idol worship was prevalent, and these images represented various deities. The smashing of these images signifies God's judgment against idolatry, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This act of destruction is reminiscent of the actions of faithful leaders like Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-20</a>), who eradicated idol worship to restore true worship of Yahweh.<p><b>all her wages will be burned in the fire,</b><br>The "wages" here symbolize the wealth and offerings accumulated through idolatrous practices, often linked to temple prostitution. Burning these wages indicates a complete purging of the corrupt gains associated with idol worship. This imagery aligns with the purification processes described in the Law, where fire is used to cleanse and purify (<a href="/numbers/31-23.htm">Numbers 31:23</a>).<p><b>and I will destroy all her idols.</b><br>The destruction of idols underscores God's intolerance for idolatry and His desire for exclusive worship. This echoes the first two commandments given to Israel (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, where false gods will be eradicated, as seen in prophetic visions like those in <a href="/isaiah/2-18.htm">Isaiah 2:18</a>.<p><b>Since she collected the wages of a prostitute,</b><br>This metaphor highlights the spiritual adultery of Israel, likening their idolatry to prostitution. The prophets frequently used this imagery to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15-34</a>). The "wages" refer to the material benefits gained from alliances with pagan nations and their gods, which were seen as acts of betrayal against Yahweh.<p><b>they will be used again on a prostitute.</b><br>This phrase suggests a cycle of judgment where the ill-gotten gains from idolatry will be returned to their source. It implies that the wealth accumulated through unfaithfulness will ultimately be squandered or used in further acts of spiritual infidelity. This reflects the principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>) and serves as a warning of the futility and consequences of idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

Idolatry is viewed as spiritual fornication, and the offerings made to the idol temples are reckoned to be harlot gifts. Hosea speaks in the same way (<a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 8, 12</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31</a>). There may be allusion to the shameful practices consecrated with the name of religion, the proceeds of which went to the support of idolatry (see Baruch 6:43; Herod., 1:199; Strabo, 16:1). <span class="cmt_word">Idols</span>; more costly images, made probably of or plated with precious metals. <span class="cmt_word">For she gathered it;</span> rather, them, the images and idols, from the offerings made by idolaters, spiritual fornicators, hence called <span class="cmt_word">the hire of an harlot. They shall return to the hire of an harlot.</span> The treasures obtained by idolatry shall go to another idolatrous people, viz. the Assyrians; the dedicated offerings in the temples at Samaria shall be carried off to Nineveh to adorn the temples there (comp. <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a>). The sentence seems to be a kind of proverbial saying, like the Latin, <span class="accented">Male parta, male dilabuntur.</span> Sehegg compares the German, <span class="accented">Wie gewonnen, so zerronnen</span>, and <span class="accented">Unrect Gut that sein Gut</span>. The judgment on Samaria was executed by the Assyrians. Three times in his short reign of less than six years did Shalmaneser IV. invade Israel. Shortly after his accession, having reason to suspect the fidelity of Hoshea, he "came up against him" (<a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>), and so overawed him by the exhibition of his superior power that the King of Israel submitted without a struggle, "became his servants and gave him presents," or rendered him tribute. But Hoshea's allegiance was not yet secured. Encouraged by the enterprise and success of the Ethiopian monarch So, or Shebek, who had defeated and slain the Egyptian king, and established himself firmly on the throne of Upper Egypt, Hoshea, in reliance on Egyptian aid, again threw off the yoke of Assyria, and refused the customary tribute. His punishment was speedy and sharp. Shalmaneser had no difficulty in making himself master of his person, "shut him up and bound him in prison." On a fresh act of rebellion, of what nature we are not informed, Shalmaneser made his third attack. This time he was everywhere resisted, and ended by laying siege to Samaria itself. Before this city his forces were detained for more than two years; nor was it till <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, when apparently his own reign had come to an end, that Samaria was taken, his successor Sargon claiming the conquest as appertaining to his first year (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2. ch. 9.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
