The name "Jacob" refers to the nation of Israel, descended from Jacob, also known as Israel. This gathering is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing restoration and unity. It echoes the promises found in <a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>, where God assures the return of His people from exile. The certainty of the gathering is underscored by the word "surely," indicating divine determination.<p><b>I will collect the remnant of Israel.</b><br>The term "remnant" refers to the faithful portion of Israel that survives judgment and exile. This concept is significant throughout the Old Testament, highlighting God's grace and the preservation of a faithful group despite widespread apostasy. The remnant theology is seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12-13</a>. It points to God's ongoing plan for redemption and the future hope of restoration. The remnant is often seen as a type of the church, the faithful community preserved by God.<p><b>I will bring them together like sheep in a pen,</b><br>The imagery of sheep in a pen suggests protection and care. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sheep were valuable assets, and shepherds were responsible for their safety. This metaphor portrays God as the Good Shepherd, a theme that resonates with <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd. The pen represents a place of security and provision, indicating God's protective oversight of His people.<p><b>like a flock in the midst of its pasture&#8212;</b><br>This phrase continues the pastoral imagery, emphasizing abundance and sustenance. A pasture is a place where sheep find nourishment, symbolizing spiritual provision and peace. The imagery connects to <a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14-15</a>, where God promises to feed His flock in rich pastures. It also foreshadows the eschatological peace and prosperity promised in the Messianic age, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>.<p><b>a noisy throng.</b><br>The description of a "noisy throng" suggests vitality and life. It indicates a large, vibrant community, contrasting with the previous state of desolation and exile. This noise can be seen as a joyful expression of the gathered community, celebrating their restoration. The imagery aligns with the joyful gatherings described in <a href="/zechariah/8-4.htm">Zechariah 8:4-5</a> and <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>, where the redeemed worship God in unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, the descendants of Jacob, who was later named Israel.

God has not forgotten any branch of Jacob&#8217;s family tree (<a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Micah has just pronounced judgment, the gathering promise shows judgment is never God&#8217;s last word for His people (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This pledge looks ahead to both the post-exilic return from Babylon (<a href="/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3-4</a>) and the ultimate regathering under Messiah when Israel looks &#8220;on Me, the One they have pierced&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will collect the remnant of Israel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The remnant&#8221; highlights a purified core refined through discipline (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s saving work often proceeds by preserving a faithful minority, then expanding blessing outward (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Collecting the remnant promises restoration of identity and purpose&#8212;Israel will again dwell as &#8220;a kingdom of priests&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in the darkest eras, the Lord keeps track of His own; no faithful heart is overlooked (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will bring them together like sheep in a pen</b><p>&#8226; The shepherd imagery conveys protection, order, and tender oversight (<a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12-13</a>; <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;pen&#8221; (fold) offers safety from predators and a place to rest&#8212;exactly what weary exiles craved.<p>&#8226; Unity is emphasized: scattered sheep become one flock under one Shepherd (<a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;bring&#8221; reminds us that restoration is God-initiated; the sheep do not find their way home alone (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a flock in the midst of its pasture&#8212;a noisy throng</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;In the midst of its pasture&#8221; pictures abundant provision.

The verse anchors Israel&#8217;s hope and, by extension, assures all God&#8217;s people that His redemptive plans are unstoppable, personal, and overflowing with joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12, 13) <span class= "bld">I will surely assemble</span> . . .--With a characteristic abruptness Micah turns from the height of sin and punishment to the height of the deliverance--from Ebal to Gerizim. Israel and the remnant shall be gathered together as a goodly flock in the luxuriant pastures of Idumaean Bozrah. The Breaker shall go before them as their Saviour and Deliverer, yea, even Jehovah at their head.

Some commentators, indeed, regard this and the following verso as the language of the false prophets; others, as a denunciation of punishment, not a promise of deliverance; others, as a late interpolation. But the style is entirely Micah's (comp. <a href="/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6, 7</a>), the promise is a true one, and such like sudden transitions are common in the prophetical books (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>; <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>); so that we need not resort to the hypothesis that some connecting link has dropped out of the text, or that the clause is misplaced; and we are fully justified in considering the paragraph as inserted here in its right position, and as predictive of the restoration of the Jews after captivity. Micah would seem to imply - I am not, indeed, as one of the false prophets who promise you earthly good without regard to your moral fitness for receiving God's bounty; neither am I one who has no message but of woe and calamity; I, too, predict salvation and happiness for a remnant of you after you have been tried by defeat and exile. <span class="cmt_word">I will surely assemble.</span> This presupposes dispersion among the heathen, such as is foretold in <a href="/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>, etc.; Micah 2:4, etc. <span class="cmt_word">O Jacob, all of thee.</span> The promise extends to the whole nation, whether called Jacob or Israel, as <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <span class="cmt_word">but still only a remnant,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that portion of the nation which should make a good use of adversity, and turn to the Lord with sincere repentance (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, etc.; <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>,. etc.). Some see in the term "remnant" an allusion to the people that were left in the northern kingdom after the fall of Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">As the sheep of Bozrah.</span> There were two or more towns so named - one in Sidon, for which see note on Amos 1:12; and another, <span class="accented">hod. Buzrah</span>, on the south border of the Hauran. This is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>, as one of the cities of Moab, a district celebrated for its flocks (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>); hence "sheep of Bozrah" may have become a proverbial saying. Many commentators take <span class="accented">Botsrah as</span> an appellative, meaning "fold," in agreement with the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quasi gregem in ovili</span>, and Chaldee, as well as Aquila and Symmachus. The parallelism in the following words seems to favour this view. The LXX. reads differently, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "in trouble." Thus, too, the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">As the flock in the midst of their fold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as a flock in the midst of its pasture</span>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall make great noise,</span> etc. Like a numerous flock bleating in its fold, so shall the returned Israelites be, prosperous and happy, celebrating their salvation with praise and exultation (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall leap forth from among men," which St. Jerome explains as meaning that the repentant Israelites shall rise above worldly things and aspire to heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1465;&#1448;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather for, any purpose, to receive, take away, remove</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gather</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1505;&#1465;&#1436;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather for, any purpose, to receive, take away, remove</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all of you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(kul&#183;l&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
