In biblical context, this can be seen as a reference to a shepherd leading his flock, a common metaphor for leadership in ancient Israel. The imagery of breaking open a way implies overcoming obstacles, reminiscent of God parting the Red Sea for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This also foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), who leads His people to salvation.<p><b>they will break through the gate, and go out by it.</b><br>The gate symbolizes a point of transition or liberation. Historically, city gates were places of both protection and vulnerability. Breaking through the gate indicates a movement from captivity to freedom, echoing the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. This can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual liberation, where believers break free from the bondage of sin through Christ (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<p><b>Their King will pass through before them,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the presence of a royal leader guiding the people. In the Old Testament, God is often depicted as the King of Israel (<a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8-10</a>). The prophecy here points to a future messianic King, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who leads His people with authority and power (<a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). The King going before them signifies divine leadership and protection.<p><b>the LORD as their leader.</b><br>This final phrase identifies the leader as the LORD Himself, underscoring the divine nature of the guidance and deliverance. In the context of Micah, this reassures the people of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God as the ultimate leader and shepherd of His people (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is recognized as the Lord who leads His followers (<a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>), fulfilling this prophetic vision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_breaker.htm">The Breaker</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a leader or deliverer who opens the way for the people.

This echoes Israel&#8217;s literal exodus from slavery (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>) and foreshadows future national restoration (<a href="/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assures active participation: God&#8217;s flock isn&#8217;t merely spectators; they move in the victory He provides&#8212;like the triumphant march in <a href="/bsb/psalms/114.htm">Psalm 114</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10</a> shows a similar miracle when an iron gate &#8220;opened by itself&#8221; for Peter, illustrating how God&#8217;s power removes barriers for faithful followers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their King will pass through before them</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people enjoy royal escort. The mention of &#8220;King&#8221; points to the promised descendant of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> pictures this King arriving in humility yet with authority, fulfilled in Jesus&#8217; Palm Sunday entry (<a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a> depicts Him returning as conquering King, again leading His own. The Micah promise therefore spans both His first coming and His future reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD as their leader</b><p>&#8226; Micah seals the identity of the King: He is none other than YHWH Himself. This affirms Christ&#8217;s deity (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33-36</a> records the ark of the covenant moving &#8220;in advance&#8221; of Israel; here the LORD personally leads, guaranteeing success.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7-10</a> celebrates God marching before His people; <a href="/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a> assures the same unfailing leadership in days to come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a> promises a divine &#8220;breaker&#8221; who destroys every barrier, invites His people to follow, leads them out in freedom, and goes ahead as both King and LORD. The verse looks back to Israel&#8217;s historic deliverances, points forward to Christ&#8217;s redemptive work, and anticipates His future, visible reign. Believers can rest in the certainty that the One who opens the way also shepherds them all the way home.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The breaker.</span>--"This Breaker is, by the confession of the Jews, the title of the Messias. . . .

The passage is clearly Messianic, and can neither be considered an interpolation nor tortured into a declaration of the siege and ruin of Samaria or Jerusalem. "One that breaketh" is a liberator, a leader that overcomes all obstacles which oppose Israel's return. There may be an allusion in the first instance to a human leader, such as Zerubbabel, in analogy with Moses and Joshua in old time, but the real conqueror intended is generally regarded as Messiah. The Breaker up is supposed to be a title of the Messiah well known to the Jews (see Pusey; and Pearson, 'Exposition of the Creed,' art. 7, note y). This interpretation is rejected by Professor Driver (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April 1887), who considers the "breaker up" to be "either a leader or a detachment of men, whose duty it was to break up walls or other obstacles opposing the progress of an army." But is not this to introduce an agency unknown to these times? Was there any special body of men trained and maintained for this particular duty? This "breaker up," according to Dr. Driver's conception, "advances before them, breaking through the gates of the prison in which the people are confined; they follow, marching forth triumphantly through this open way; their king, with Jehovah at his side (<a href="/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>), heads the victorious procession (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">They have broken up;</span> <span class="accented">broken forth</span>, or <span class="accented">through.</span> The captives cooperate with their leader. <span class="cmt_word">Have passed through the gate,</span> etc. The prophet speaks of a solemn, regular removal, like the Exodus from Egypt, which no human power can oppose. <span class="cmt_word">Their king.</span> The same as Jehovah in the next clause (<a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>). He shall lead the host, as he headed the Israelites when they left the house of bondage (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The prediction may look forward to the final gathering of Israel, which St. Paul seems to contemplate when he writes, "And so all Israel shall be saved" (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One who breaks open the way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1509;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#333;&#183;r&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
