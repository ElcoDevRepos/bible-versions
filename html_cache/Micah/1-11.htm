The call to "depart in shameful nakedness" signifies defeat and humiliation, a common fate for those conquered in ancient times. Nakedness in the Bible often symbolizes shame and exposure (<a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>). The judgment upon Shaphir reflects the broader theme of divine retribution for sin, as the people are stripped of their dignity and security.<p><b>The dwellers of Zaanan will not come out.</b><br>Zaanan, likely identified with the town of Zenan mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-37.htm">Joshua 15:37</a>, means "going out." The irony here is that the inhabitants, whose town name suggests movement, are unable to leave due to fear or siege. This reflects the paralysis and helplessness that comes with divine judgment. The refusal or inability to "come out" signifies a lack of deliverance and the inescapability of God's decrees.<p><b>Beth-ezel is in mourning;</b><br>Beth-ezel, meaning "house of nearness" or "house of removal," is depicted as mourning. Mourning in the biblical context often involves wearing sackcloth, ashes, and lamentation (<a href="/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>). The mourning of Beth-ezel indicates a deep sense of loss and grief, possibly due to the destruction or the loss of its protective role for neighboring towns. This mourning is a direct consequence of the judgment pronounced by God.<p><b>its support is taken from you.</b><br>The phrase "its support is taken from you" suggests that Beth-ezel, once a place of refuge or assistance, can no longer provide aid or protection. This loss of support underscores the theme of isolation and vulnerability in the face of divine judgment. The removal of support can be seen as a metaphor for the withdrawal of God's favor and protection, leaving the people exposed to the consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaphir.htm">Shaphir</a></b><br>A town whose name means "beautiful" or "pleasant" in Hebrew.

The command &#8220;Depart&#8221; is a prophetic announcement of exile; judgment is already set in motion (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-8.htm">2 Chronicles 29:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Shameful nakedness&#8221; speaks of utter disgrace, stripping away every pretense of security (<a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Shaphir was known for pleasant surroundings, yet its beauty cannot shield it from God&#8217;s righteous wrath&#8212;sin cancels every earthly advantage (<a href="/hosea/2-3.htm">Hosea 2:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s people had been warned that covenant disobedience would end in public humiliation; Micah shows that warning becoming reality (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The dwellers of Zaanan will not come out</b><p>&#8226; Zaanan, once a place that &#8220;went out&#8221; to meet travelers, is now paralyzed by fear; siege and terror keep its people behind barred doors (<a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal to &#8220;come out&#8221; contrasts sharply with faith-filled obedience that trusts God&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores how sin enslaves: instead of marching forward in the Lord&#8217;s strength, the town is immobilized, echoing Israel&#8217;s earlier moments of cowardice (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Beth-ezel is in mourning;

&#8220;Its support is taken&#8221; pictures a shelter ripped away, leaving Judah exposed to invading armies (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-5.htm">Lamentations 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; When those who should stand firm collapse under judgment, the entire community feels the loss; human alliances crumble when God removes His protective hand (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a> layers three vivid snapshots of coming judgment. Shaphir will march out stripped of dignity; Zaanan will cower in fear, unable to act; Beth-ezel will fail as a place of help. Each town&#8217;s name, once a boast, becomes an irony under God&#8217;s discipline. The verse drives home one central truth: sin always results in humiliation, fear, and loss, while only steadfast obedience keeps a people clothed, courageous, and secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Saphir . . .

St. Jerome, in despair of explaining these Greek renderings, says here, "Multum Hebraicum a LXX. interpretatione discordat, et tantis tam mea quam illorum translatio difficultatibus involuta est, ut si quando indiguimus Spiritus Dei (semper autem in exponendis Scripturis sanctis illius indigemus adventu), nunc vel maxime eum adesse cupiamus." <span class="cmt_word">Zaanan</span> is supposed to be the same as Zenan, mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-37.htm">Joshua 15:37</a>. The meaning of the name is doubtful. It is taken to signify "abounding in flocks" or "going out." <span class="cmt_word">Came not forth;</span> or, <span class="accented">is not come forth.</span> The paronomasia seems to lie rather in sound than sense, and is variously explained, "The inhabitants of Flock town went not forth with their flocks."

Beth-ezel is explained, "House at one's side." "Neighbour town;" so the prophet would say, "Neighbour town is no neighbour to you," affords you no help. But various other explanations are given. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Lamentation makes its sure abode at Beth-ezel from your calamity." This may, perhaps, be supported by the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "She shall receive of you the stroke of anguish." Dr. Cheyne connects the whole verse with one idea, "Zaanan would willingly take to flight, but the sound of the mourning at Beth-ezel (which might mean, "the house, or place, at one's side') fills them with despair." Taking Beth-ezel to mean "House of root," others would interpret, on account of the public sorrow, "The 'house of root' affords no firm home for you." Others, again," The lamentation of 'The near House' will not stop near it, but pass on to other places." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-ezel</span> is probably the <span class="accented">Azal</span> of <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, the <span class="accented">beth</span> being dropped, as is often the case.
