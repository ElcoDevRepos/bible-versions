In the prophetic tradition, such declarations are direct communications from God, underscoring the importance of the message that follows. This is a common formula used by prophets to assert that their words are not their own but are from God, as seen throughout the books of the prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>As for the prophets who lead My people astray:</b><br>The prophets being addressed are false prophets, those who claim to speak for God but instead mislead the people. In the historical context of Micah, many prophets were swayed by personal gain or political pressure, leading the people away from true worship and justice. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, where false prophets are condemned for their deceit.<p><b>who proclaim peace while they chew with their teeth:</b><br>This phrase suggests that these prophets offer messages of peace and prosperity when they are being fed or bribed. The imagery of "chewing with their teeth" implies that their prophecies are motivated by personal gain rather than divine truth. This reflects a broader biblical theme where false prophets are criticized for telling people what they want to hear, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>.<p><b>but declare war against one who puts nothing in their mouths:</b><br>In contrast to their messages of peace for those who provide for them, these prophets threaten or curse those who do not offer them gifts or sustenance. This behavior highlights their corruption and the transactional nature of their so-called prophecies. The condemnation of such practices is consistent with the biblical call for justice and integrity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>, which warn against greed and the love of money.<br><br>Overall, this verse serves as a critique of the religious leaders of Micah's time, calling out their hypocrisy and corruption. It underscores the importance of true prophecy, which is not swayed by personal gain but is faithful to God's message. This theme is relevant throughout the Bible, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of true prophecy in Jesus Christ, who is the faithful and true witness (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea.

The phrase reminds us that true prophecy begins with listening to God, not men (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As for the prophets</b><p>The spotlight turns to those who should have been spiritual guardians. Instead, they had become a separate class with their own agenda, much like the false prophets condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-3</a>. God singles them out because leadership corruption spreads quickly to the people (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who lead My people astray</b><p>Their core crime is deception. By twisting God&#8217;s word they divert the nation from covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>). Jesus later warns of blind guides whose followers &#8220;fall into a pit&#8221; with them (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>). Spiritual misdirection is never harmless; it endangers souls, families, and nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who proclaim peace while they chew with their teeth</b><p>Picture prophets feasting at the expense of those they flatter. When their bellies are full, their message is soothing: &#8220;Everything&#8217;s fine&#8212;no judgment ahead&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10-11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;peace&#8221; they announce is conditional on personal gain.<p>&#8226; Their appetite dictates their sermon, turning ministry into a marketplace (<a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; True peace comes only through repentance and obedience (<a href="/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but declare war against one who puts nothing in their mouths</b><p>Refuse to feed them and their tone shifts from comfort to curse. Like the sons of Eli who seized the best meat by force (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>), these prophets weaponize their words for profit (<a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>-12).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Declare war&#8221; exposes their heart: they are not neutral but hostile toward any who disrupt their income stream.<p>&#8226; Their threats manipulate God&#8217;s people through fear rather than truth (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast reveals a simple test: prophets motivated by greed will bless those who pay and condemn those who don&#8217;t, while true servants speak God&#8217;s word regardless of personal cost (<a href="/1_kings/22-13.htm">1 Kings 22:13-14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a> condemns prophets who turn ministry into a business transaction. They preach &#8220;peace&#8221; when rewarded and pronounce &#8220;war&#8221; when deprived, leading God&#8217;s people into deadly deception. The verse calls believers to discern teaching by its faithfulness to God&#8217;s unchanging word, not by the charisma or personal benefit of the messenger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">That bite with their teeth.</span>--The concluding statement that the false prophets declare war against those who do not put into their mouth indicates the meaning of the former expression, namely, "they say peace to those who feed and bribe them." The Hebrew word, <span class= "ital">nashak,</span> which is rendered "bite," is strictly applied to serpents, to "an adder in the path," and is therefore especially appropriate to the false and lying nature of the prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> ? &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Sins of the false prophets who led the people astray.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the prophets</span> (<a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>). These are the lying prophets of whom Jeremiah complains (<a href="/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace.</span> Very many commentators take the phrase, "bite with the teeth," to mean "eat," so that the clause signifies that the prophets when bribed with food predict peace and happiness to people. The antithesis of the following clause seems to require this explanation, which is further supported by the Chaldee. But it is quite unprecedented to find the word translated "bite" (<span class="accented">nashakh</span>) in the sense of "eat," or as it is taken here, "to have something to eat;" wherever it occurs it means "to bite like a serpent," to wound (see <a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8, 9</a>; <a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>). The parallelism of the succeeding member does not compel us to put a forced interpretation upon the word. These venal seers do vital harm, inflict gravest injury, when they proclaim peace where there is no peace; by such false comfort they are really infusing poison and death. <span class="cmt_word">He that putteth not into their mouths.</span> If any one does not bribe them, and so stop their evil mouths. <span class="cmt_word">They even prepare war against him.</span> The Hebrew expression is, "they consecrate" or "sanctify war." There may be allusion to the religious rites accompanying a declaration of war (<a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>); but Micah seems to mean that, if the customary bribes are withheld, these prophets announce war and calamity as inevitable; they proclaim them in God's name, as speaking with his sanction and under his Inspiration (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>;
