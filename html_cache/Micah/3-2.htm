The inversion of moral values&#8212;hating good and loving evil&#8212;reflects a deep spiritual decay. This is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, where woe is pronounced on those who call evil good and good evil. The leaders' actions are contrary to God's nature, who is inherently good (<a href="/psalms/100-5.htm">Psalm 100:5</a>). This moral inversion is a sign of judgment, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28-32</a>, where God gives people over to a depraved mind when they reject His truth.<p><b>You tear the skin from my people</b><br>This metaphorical language illustrates the extreme exploitation and oppression by the leaders. The imagery of tearing skin suggests brutality and a lack of compassion, akin to a predator devouring its prey. This reflects the leaders' abuse of power, as they were supposed to protect and serve the people (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). The phrase also echoes the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where leaders are expected to shepherd rather than harm (<a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>).<p><b>and strip the flesh from their bones.</b><br>Continuing the metaphor, this phrase emphasizes the complete and ruthless exploitation of the people. The leaders' actions are likened to butchery, stripping away all that is vital and leaving nothing behind. This can be seen as a violation of the covenantal law, which calls for justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The imagery also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and destruction that will come upon these leaders for their actions (<a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>). In a typological sense, this contrasts with Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), offering protection and life rather than destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, active during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, who spoke against the corruption and injustice in Judah and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_israel.htm">Leaders of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Micah's rebuke, including rulers, priests, and prophets who were leading the people astray through their unjust practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often the focus of prophetic messages due to their departure from God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and authority who speaks through Micah, expressing His displeasure with the leaders' actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The common people of Israel and Judah who suffer under the unjust practices of their leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_clarity.htm">Moral Clarity</a></b><br>As believers, we must discern and uphold what is good according to God's standards, rejecting the inversion of moral values prevalent in society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_accountability.htm">Leadership Accountability</a></b><br>Those in positions of authority, whether in the church or society, are called to lead with justice and integrity, serving rather than exploiting those under their care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_oppressed.htm">Compassion for the Oppressed</a></b><br>We are called to be advocates for the vulnerable and oppressed, ensuring that our actions and policies reflect God's heart for justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Recognizing areas where we have loved evil and hated good, we must repent and seek God's forgiveness, allowing Him to transform our hearts and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Prophets like Micah remind us of the importance of speaking truth to power and calling out injustice, even when it is unpopular or risky.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Micah_3_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Micah 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Micah_3_2_Leaders_good_vs_evil_actions.htm">How does Micah 3:2 describe the leaders' actions towards good and evil?

There is no neutral ground&#8212;loving evil automatically means hating good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You tear the skin from My people</b><p>The prophet switches to graphic imagery to uncover the cruelty behind the policies.<p>&#8226; Like a butcher flaying an animal, these authorities were &#8220;devouring widows&#8217; houses&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-47.htm">Luke 20:47</a>) and stripping vulnerable citizens of land and livelihood (<a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3&#8211;4</a> indicts shepherds who &#8220;eat the fat, wear the wool, but you do not feed the flock,&#8221; paralleling Micah&#8217;s charge that leaders are exploiting rather than protecting.<p>The metaphor conveys literal oppression: unjust taxes, seizure of property, and court decisions bought with bribes. God calls the victims &#8220;My people,&#8221; underscoring His personal ownership and the seriousness of the offense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and strip the flesh from their bones</b><p>The picture intensifies to expose total exploitation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a> asks, &#8220;Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour My people as they eat bread,&#8221; reinforcing the portrayal of relentless consumption.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4&#8211;6</a> describes merchants who &#8220;trample the needy&#8221; and &#8220;buy the poor for a pair of sandals,&#8221; showing how economic abuse can feel like flesh being ripped away.<p>By piling up the images, Micah reveals a progression:<p>- Hatred of good &#8594; evil actions &#8594; systemic brutality that leaves nothing intact.<p>The leaders&#8217; greed was so entrenched that the people were left spiritually, materially, and emotionally skinned alive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a> condemns leaders whose hearts have turned upside down&#8212;loving evil and hating good&#8212;and whose policies consume the very people they were called to serve. The vivid language unmasks the vicious nature of sin: it begins with misplaced affections, moves into oppressive deeds, and ends in total devastation. God sees, calls the oppressed &#8220;My people,&#8221; and promises both justice for the perpetrators and care for the victims.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2, 3) <span class= "bld">Who hate the good.</span>--The judges, instead of fulfilling the obligations of their office, whereby they should be "for the people to God-ward," perpetrated the most flagrant cruelty upon them. Micah compares it to the process of preparing food, in which every part of the animal, even to the bones, is utilised. So the judges robbed the people until there was nothing left to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The good...the evil;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> goodness and wickedness.

We have the same figurative expression for merciless extortion and pillage. Ezekiel makes a similar complaint (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). Cheyne sees in this and the following verse a possible allusion to cannibalism as at least known to the Israelites by hearsay or tradition. There is a passage in Wisdom (12:5) which somewhat countenances the idea that the Canaanites were guilty of this enormity, but it is probably only a rhetorical exaggeration of the writer. In the present passage the terms seem to be simply metaphors taken from the preparation of meat for human food. Such an allusion is natural in the mouth of one who had just been speaking of Israel as a flock (<a href="/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You hate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1445;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#333;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8130.htm">Strong's 8130: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">good</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and love</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
