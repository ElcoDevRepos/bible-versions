In the context of Micah, the prophet speaks of a time when those who oppose God's people will witness God's intervention. This reflects a common biblical theme where God ultimately reveals His power and justice to the nations (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>).<p><b>and will be covered with shame&#8212;</b><br>Shame in the biblical context often signifies a loss of honor and status. Enemies of God's people, who once mocked and oppressed them, will experience disgrace. This is reminiscent of the fate of the enemies of Israel throughout the Old Testament, such as the Egyptians during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25-27</a>).<p><b>she who said to me, &#8220;Where is the LORD your God?&#8221;</b><br>This taunt reflects a common challenge faced by the Israelites, questioning God's presence and power during times of distress (<a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>, <a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>). It underscores the mockery and doubt that God's people endure from unbelievers, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.<p><b>My eyes will see her;</b><br>The speaker anticipates witnessing the downfall of their adversaries. This personal vindication is a promise of God's justice, where the faithful will see the reversal of fortunes. It echoes the assurance found in <a href="/psalms/91-8.htm">Psalm 91:8</a>, where the righteous observe the punishment of the wicked.<p><b>at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets.</b><br>This imagery of being trampled like mud signifies utter defeat and humiliation. It is a vivid depiction of the complete overthrow of those who oppose God and His people. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a> and <a href="/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>, where enemies are likened to being crushed underfoot, symbolizing God's ultimate victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.
