This term emphasizes their covenant relationship with God, reminding them of their heritage and responsibilities. The prophets often used "house of Jacob" to call the people back to faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-4.htm">Jeremiah 2:4</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the people's perception of God's character. The Spirit of the LORD is often associated with patience, mercy, and long-suffering, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. The question implies that the people have misunderstood God's nature, suggesting that their actions, rather than God's character, are the cause of their troubles. This reflects a common prophetic theme where the people's sins lead to their suffering, not God's impatience.<p><b>Are these the things He does?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase questions whether the current circumstances align with God's usual actions. It implies that the people's experiences of judgment and hardship are not typical of God's dealings with those who are faithful. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>, where it is stated that God does not willingly bring affliction. The rhetorical nature of the question suggests that the people should reflect on their actions and relationship with God.<p><b>Do not My words bring good to him who walks uprightly?</b><br>This statement affirms the consistent biblical principle that obedience to God's word results in blessing and favor. It contrasts the experiences of the righteous with those of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of living according to God's commandments, promising that those who do so will experience His goodness.

Somewhat similarly Orelli, "Is this the speech of the house of Jacob?" viz. - Should Jehovah be impatient (as these threats declare him to be)? or were these his doings? The following clause is Jehovah's answer to the objection. <span class="cmt_word">Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?</span> or, <span class="accented">shortened</span>. Is he less long suffering than Jehovah of heretofore? Will you accuse Jehovah of impatience?
