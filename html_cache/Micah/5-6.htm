Assyria was known for its military might and had previously conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The prophecy suggests a reversal of fortunes, where the oppressors become the oppressed. The "sword" symbolizes military strength and divine judgment. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of God's ultimate justice and deliverance for His people, reminiscent of other biblical victories where God intervened on behalf of Israel.<p><b>and the land of Nimrod with the blade drawn</b><br>Nimrod, a figure associated with the founding of several ancient cities, including Babylon, represents human rebellion against God. The "land of Nimrod" likely refers to regions under Assyrian control, emphasizing the extent of the prophesied victory. The "blade drawn" signifies readiness for battle and divine intervention. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of God using His people to execute judgment on nations that oppose His will, as seen in the stories of Joshua and the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>So He will deliver us when Assyria invades our land</b><br>This assurance of deliverance highlights God's protective role over Israel. Historically, Assyria posed a significant threat, having already devastated the Northern Kingdom. The promise of deliverance is consistent with God's covenantal faithfulness, as seen in other scriptures where God rescues His people from seemingly insurmountable threats, such as the Exodus from Egypt. This deliverance can also be seen as a type of Christ, who delivers believers from spiritual oppression.<p><b>and marches into our borders</b><br>The phrase underscores the imminent threat posed by Assyria, emphasizing the urgency and seriousness of the situation. The imagery of an invading army highlights the vulnerability of Israel without divine intervention. This scenario is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God protected His people from foreign invaders, such as during the reign of King Hezekiah when God miraculously saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to protect and preserve His people against all odds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire in the ancient Near East, known for its military might and conquests.
