The focus is on those who "devise iniquity," indicating a premeditated and intentional planning of wrongdoing. The imagery of plotting "on their beds" suggests that these individuals are consumed by their schemes even in their private moments, highlighting the depth of their moral corruption. This reflects a broader biblical theme where the heart and mind are the sources of sin (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel was one where leaders and influential figures often abused their power for personal gain, a theme echoed in other prophetic books like Amos and Isaiah. The phrase also serves as a warning against complacency in sin, as it is not merely the act but the intent that is condemned.<p><b>At morning&#8217;s light they accomplish it</b><br>The transition from night to morning signifies the movement from planning to action. The phrase "at morning&#8217;s light" suggests a deliberate and calculated execution of their plans, indicating that these individuals are not acting impulsively but with intent and purpose. In the ancient Near Eastern context, morning was often the time for legal and business activities, implying that these acts of iniquity are carried out in the public sphere, affecting the community at large. This reflects the biblical principle that sin, though conceived in secret, often manifests openly (<a href="/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>). The prophetic literature frequently condemns the leaders of Israel for their public injustices, as seen in the actions of figures like King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.<p><b>because the power is in their hands.</b><br>This phrase highlights the abuse of power and authority. The individuals in question have the means and opportunity to carry out their evil plans, underscoring a theme of social injustice prevalent in the prophetic writings. The phrase suggests a societal structure where power is concentrated in the hands of a few, often leading to exploitation and oppression of the vulnerable, a situation condemned by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. Theologically, this reflects the fallen nature of humanity and the corrupting influence of power, as seen in the narrative of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The misuse of power contrasts with the biblical ideal of leadership exemplified by Jesus Christ, who used His authority to serve and uplift others (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

Wrongdoing isn&#8217;t merely an outward slip; it starts in the mind (<a href="/proverbs/23-7.htm">Proverbs 23:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is literally true, the warning is just as real for anyone today who knowingly schemes against others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and plot evil on their beds!</b><p>Sin doesn&#8217;t sleep. In the stillness of night these schemers rehearse their next move, much like <a href="/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>: &#8220;Even on his bed he plots iniquity; he sets himself on a path that is not good.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase paints a picture of ongoing meditation on sin instead of God&#8217;s word (compare <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Darkness often masks wrongdoing (<a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14&#8211;15</a>), yet God &#8220;sees the darkness as light&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>). Nothing escapes His notice.<p>&#8226; Every believer is urged to surrender nighttime thoughts to the Lord, guarding against bitterness, lust, or greed that can grow unchecked (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At morning&#8217;s light they accomplish it</b><p>What was secretly planned at night becomes public action at dawn. The first opportunity is seized (<a href="/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, &#8220;For they cannot sleep unless they do evil&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Sin is fertile: once conceived, it presses for birth (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Morning&#8217;s light&#8212;meant for fresh mercies (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>)&#8212;is here misused for fresh wickedness.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores human responsibility. No external force makes these people sin; they choose it, then carry it out.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the power is in their hands.</b><p>The perpetrators hold societal clout. Authority, wealth, or influence lets them execute their schemes unchecked (<a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Power, a gift from God (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>), becomes a weapon when severed from righteousness.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns leaders not to exploit the vulnerable (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God promises to overturn such injustice: &#8220;Woe to those who make unjust laws&#8230; to deprive the oppressed of justice&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a> exposes sin that starts in the mind, festers in secret, erupts in action, and is emboldened by unchecked power.

As the word <span class="accented">el</span> may be taken to mean "God" as well as "power," some render here, "For their hand is their god," comparing the boast of Mezentius in Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:773 - <p><span class="accented">"Dextra mihi Deus et telum quod missile libro."</span> The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Quoniam contra Deum est manus eorum</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Because they lifted not up their hands unto God."
