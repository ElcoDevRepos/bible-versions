The use of "both hands" suggests a complete and deliberate commitment to wrongdoing, indicating that evil actions are not accidental but intentional and practiced. This reflects the broader theme of human depravity found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where humanity's wickedness is described as great on the earth. The imagery of hands being skilled at evil can also be seen as a reversal of the biblical ideal of using one's hands for righteous work, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31</a>.<p><b>the prince and the judge demand a bribe.</b><br>This part of the verse points to systemic corruption within the leadership and judicial systems. Princes and judges, who are supposed to uphold justice and righteousness, are instead exploiting their positions for personal gain. This echoes the warnings against bribery found in <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, where leaders are instructed to judge fairly and not pervert justice. The demand for bribes indicates a society where justice is not accessible to the poor and marginalized, a theme that is frequently addressed by the prophets, including Isaiah and Amos.<p><b>When the powerful utters his evil desire,</b><br>The "powerful" refers to those in positions of authority and influence, whose words and desires can shape societal norms and actions. This phrase suggests that the powerful are not only complicit in evil but are also initiators of it. Their desires are not aligned with God's will, contrasting with the biblical call for leaders to be shepherds of the people, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>. The influence of the powerful in promoting evil can be compared to the influence of the Pharisees in the New Testament, who are criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy and leading others astray (Matthew 23).<p><b>they all conspire together.</b><br>This indicates a collective agreement and collaboration in wrongdoing among the leaders and influential figures. The conspiracy suggests a deliberate and organized effort to perpetuate injustice, similar to the conspiracies against the prophets and Jesus Himself, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a> and <a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>. This collective action against righteousness highlights the need for divine intervention and justice, a theme that runs throughout the prophetic books and is ultimately fulfilled in the coming of Christ, who brings true justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.

This clause and the rest of the verse are very obscure Cheyne supposes the text to be corrupt. Henderson renders, "For evil their hands are well prepared;" so virtually Hitzig, Pusey, and the Septuagint. Caspari agrees rather with the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Malum manuum suarum dicunt bonum</span>)," Hands are (busy) upon evil to make (it seem) good," which looks to that extremity of iniquity when men "call evil good, and good evil" (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The general meaning is that they are ready enough to do evil, and, as the next clause says, can be bribed to do anything. <span class="cmt_word">The prince asketh;</span> makes some nefarious demand of the judge, some perversion of justice at his hands, as in the case of Naboth (<a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The judge asketh</span> (<span class="accented">is ready</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for a reward.</span> The judge is willing to do what the prince wishes, if he is bribed for it.

And they entangle the good more than briars, and the righteous more than a thorn hedge."
