The shame they experience is a result of their realization of God's supremacy and their own powerlessness. This echoes the prophetic theme found in <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, where it is declared that all who have raged against God will come to Him and be put to shame. The imagery of nations being ashamed is also seen in the context of God's deliverance of Israel, as in <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>, where the surrounding nations tremble at the display of God's power.<p><b>Deprived of all their might</b><br>This phrase suggests a stripping away of the power and influence that these nations once held. Historically, this can be seen in the downfall of empires that opposed Israel, such as Assyria and Babylon. Theologically, it reflects the biblical principle that human strength is nothing compared to divine power, as seen in <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>, where it is stated that a king is not saved by his great army. This also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of all earthly powers at the return of Christ, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>.<p><b>They will put their hands over their mouths</b><br>This gesture is one of astonishment and silence, often associated with awe or fear. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, covering one's mouth was a sign of submission or acknowledgment of a higher authority. <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4-5</a> illustrates this when Job, confronted by God's majesty, places his hand over his mouth in humility. This act signifies the nations' recognition of God's authority and their inability to respond or challenge His actions.<p><b>And their ears will become deaf</b><br>The deafness of the nations symbolizes their inability to comprehend or respond to God's judgment. This can be seen as a form of divine retribution, where those who refused to listen to God's word are now unable to hear. <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> speaks of a similar judgment, where the people's hearts are hardened, and their ears are made dull. This deafness also highlights the futility of relying on human wisdom and understanding in the face of divine revelation, as emphasized in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</a>, where God makes the wisdom of the world foolish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding nations of Israel and Judah, often seen as adversaries or oppressors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often the recipients of prophetic messages.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The event where God reveals His power and justice, leading to the humbling of nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>The faithful few who remain true to God amidst widespread disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>Despite their power, nations are subject to God's authority and will ultimately recognize His supremacy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humbling_of_human_pride.htm">The Humbling of Human Pride</a></b><br>Human power and pride are temporary;

The feeling is the same as in <a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a>, where enemies are &#8220;suddenly put to shame.&#8221;<p>Key thought: The very people who once shamed God&#8217;s people will feel that same disgrace when truth is revealed (<a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>deprived of all their might</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;
