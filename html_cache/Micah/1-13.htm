The command to "harness your chariot horses" suggests urgency and preparation for impending judgment or attack. Historically, Lachish was a fortified city, often involved in military campaigns, as seen in the Assyrian conquest under Sennacherib. The city's reliance on military might rather than on God is implied here, highlighting a theme of misplaced trust. This phrase serves as a warning to prepare for divine judgment, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion,</b><br>Lachish is identified as the starting point of sin for Jerusalem, the "Daughter of Zion." This suggests that the idolatrous practices or political alliances of Lachish influenced the capital city. Historically, Lachish may have been a conduit for the introduction of foreign gods and practices into Judah, leading to spiritual corruption. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that sin often spreads from one community to another, emphasizing the need for vigilance and purity among God's people.<p><b>for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</b><br>The transgressions of Israel, likely referring to idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness, were present in Lachish. This indicates that the city adopted the sinful practices of the northern kingdom, which had already fallen to Assyria due to its disobedience. The phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments, as seen throughout the prophetic literature. It also highlights the interconnectedness of the people of God, where the sins of one group can affect the entire community, a theme echoed in the New Testament's call for the church to maintain holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

Lachish, a fortified city of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>), trusted in its impressive stables and chariot force (cf. <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>; 31:1). God&#8217;s command is not encouragement but irony: hitch up the horses because judgment is galloping toward you. Lachish had once proudly resisted Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>), yet the Lord now exposes the futility of military security (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). The verse reminds us, as literally true today as then, that worldly strength cannot shield a nation or a believer when God calls for accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion</b><p>Micah points to Lachish as &#8220;the beginning of sin&#8221; for Jerusalem, the &#8220;Daughter of Zion&#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>b). The city served as a cultural gateway between Judah and the idolatrous practices of the northern kingdom and surrounding nations. Through Lachish&#8217;s trade, diplomacy, and military alliances, foreign gods and ungodly values flowed southward until Jerusalem herself stumbled (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>). Just as Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calves became &#8220;a sin&#8221; that ensnared Israel (<a href="/1_kings/12-30.htm">1 Kings 12:30</a>), Lachish&#8217;s compromise opened the floodgates in Judah. Sin rarely storms the citadel first; it slips in through an open gate, and the Lord records that first crack in the wall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the transgressions of Israel were found in you</b><p>The concluding clause grounds Micah&#8217;s charge: &#8220;for the transgressions of Israel were found in you&#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>c). The northern kingdom&#8217;s rebellion&#8212;idolatry, injustice, reliance on foreign powers (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6&#8211;8</a>)&#8212;had taken root in Lachish. God sees no regional boundaries; when the same sins appear in Judah, He labels them &#8220;Israel&#8217;s&#8221; transgressions, underscoring their common covenant and shared guilt (<a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>). Spiritual infection spreads by contact, and Lachish had become a Petri dish for the very offenses that led to Samaria&#8217;s fall (<a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5&#8211;7</a>). The mirror held to Lachish warns every believer: tolerated sin anywhere soon becomes transgression everywhere (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a> warns that trust in human strength invites divine correction, that compromise in one strategic place can corrupt an entire people, and that God traces sin to its point of entry. Lachish hitched its horses but could not outrun judgment. So must we guard the gateways of our lives, letting no &#8220;beginning of sin&#8221; take root, remembering that the Lord who literally judged Lachish will faithfully hold us to the same holy standard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Bind the chariot to the swift beast</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> make haste to escape with thy goods. Lachish was the most important of the cities enumerated. It was fortified by Rehoboam, and was sought as a refuge by Amaziah from the conspiracy formed against him in Jerusalem. After the capture of the Holy City by Nebuchadnezzar, Lachish alone remained, with Azekah, of the defenced cities of Judah. It appears, from its position as a border city, to have been the channel for introducing into the kingdom of Judah the idolatry set up by Jeroboam in Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lachish</span>.

A connection between Jerusalem and Lachish is found in the case of Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>), but nothing bearing on religion is mentioned.
