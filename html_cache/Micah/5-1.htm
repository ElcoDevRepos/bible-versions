The term "daughter of troops" suggests a city accustomed to warfare, possibly indicating its military strength or the frequent conflicts it faces. The call to "mobilize your troops" reflects an urgent need for defense, highlighting the imminent threat of invasion. Historically, Jerusalem faced numerous sieges, notably by the Assyrians and later the Babylonians. This call to arms underscores the city's vulnerability despite its military preparations.<p><b>for a siege is laid against us!</b><br>The prophecy foresees a siege, a common military tactic in ancient times where an enemy surrounds a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This specific siege likely refers to the Assyrian threat under King Sennacherib or the later Babylonian siege. The phrase captures the dire situation facing Israel, emphasizing the inevitability of conflict and the need for divine intervention. The historical context of sieges in the ancient Near East involved prolonged periods of hardship, starvation, and eventual conquest.<p><b>With a rod they will strike the cheek of the judge of Israel.</b><br>Striking the cheek with a rod symbolizes humiliation and defeat. The "judge of Israel" refers to the nation's leader, possibly King Hezekiah during the Assyrian threat or another ruler during subsequent invasions. This act of striking signifies not just physical assault but also a deep insult to the authority and dignity of Israel's leadership. In a broader prophetic sense, this humiliation foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who was also struck and humiliated before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>). The imagery of the rod connects to the idea of discipline and judgment, themes prevalent throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_troops.htm">Daughter of Troops</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the people of Jerusalem or Judah, depicted as a vulnerable city under siege.

Micah&#8217;s audience would sense both immediate and future fulfillment.<p>&#8226; Jesus later warns of another siege (<a href="/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a>), showing that rebellion against God brings cycles of judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With a rod they will strike the cheek of the judge of Israel</b><p>The climax is humiliation: the nation&#8217;s leader&#8212;&#8220;judge&#8221; or ruler&#8212;will be dishonored publicly.<p>&#8226; Zedekiah&#8217;s capture and abuse by Babylon fits this (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the verse also foreshadows the greater Ruler who is struck before He reigns.

Jerusalem is addressed, as in <a href="/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9, 11</a>, not the invading army. The prophet returns to the view of the misery and humiliation expressed in that passage. <span class="cmt_word">Gather thyself in troops;</span> or, <span class="accented">thou shalt gather thyself, etc.</span> Jerusalem must collect its armies to defend itself from the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">O daughter of troops.</span> Jerusalem is thus named from the number of soldiers collected within her walls, from whence marauding expeditions were wont to set forth. Pusey considers that she is so called from the acts of violence, robbery, and bloodshed which are done within her (<a href="/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>; <a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>).

To smite upon the cheek is the grossest insult (comp. <a href="/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="/luke/22-64.htm">Luke 22:64</a>) When Zion is thus besieged, and its rulers suffer the utmost contumely, its condition must look hopeless, Such a state of things was realized in the treatment of Zedekiah (<a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.), and in many subsequent sieges of Jerusalem. But the underlying idea is that Israel shall suffer dire distress at the hands of her enemies until Messiah comes, and she herself turns to the Lord.
