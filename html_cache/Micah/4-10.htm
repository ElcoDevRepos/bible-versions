The imagery of labor is often used in the Bible to depict a period of pain that ultimately leads to a new beginning or deliverance (<a href="/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17-18</a>, <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>). The Daughter of Zion represents the people of Jerusalem, emphasizing their vulnerability and the impending judgment due to their sins.<p><b>For now you will leave the city and camp in the open fields.</b><br>This indicates a forced exile from Jerusalem, suggesting a temporary and vulnerable state as the people are displaced from their homes. Historically, this reflects the Babylonian captivity when the Israelites were taken from their land. The open fields symbolize exposure and lack of protection, contrasting with the security of the city walls.<p><b>You will go to Babylon;</b><br>This prophecy specifically names Babylon as the place of exile, which was fulfilled when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem in 586 BC. Babylon was a dominant empire known for its grandeur and idolatry, representing a place of both physical and spiritual captivity for the Israelites. This exile was a consequence of the nation's disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>there you will be rescued;</b><br>Despite the dire circumstances, this phrase offers hope and assurance of deliverance. It foreshadows the eventual return of the Jewish people from Babylonian captivity, which occurred under the decree of Cyrus the Great (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). This deliverance is a testament to God's faithfulness and mercy, even in judgment.<p><b>there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies!</b><br>The promise of redemption highlights God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate deliverer. Redemption here implies a buying back or liberation from bondage, which is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). This act of redemption prefigures the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).

This labor metaphor conveys both judgment and hope&#8212;pain that precedes new life.<p>&#8226; Similar prophetic imagery appears in <a href="/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17-18</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>, underscoring that God often uses the travail of His people to bring about future blessing.<p>&#8226; The agony is real; sin has consequences (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-6</a>). Yet, as with childbirth, the suffering signals something about to be born&#8212;God&#8217;s plan of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For now you will leave the city</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;For now&#8221; marks a prophetic certainty: exile is imminent. Jerusalem, the city God chose (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>), will be vacated because its inhabitants rejected His ways (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The loss of the city means loss of perceived safety and privilege. The people must learn that covenant security depends on obedience, not geography (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And camp in the open fields</b><p>&#8226; Living in open country strips away walls, gates, and defenses. God allows His people to experience vulnerability so they grasp their dependence on Him alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This temporary condition echoes Israel&#8217;s earlier wilderness journey where God refined and taught them (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>). What seems like regression is actually preparation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will go to Babylon</b><p>&#8226; Micah predicts the specific destination decades before it happens, confirming God&#8217;s foreknowledge (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Babylon symbolizes human pride and opposition to God (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>). Exile there demonstrates that when God&#8217;s people adopt worldly ways, He may send them to the world&#8217;s capital of rebellion to reveal its emptiness (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment, God preserves a remnant (<a href="/daniel/1-6.htm">Daniel 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There you will be rescued</b><p>&#8226; The same place of captivity becomes the stage for deliverance.

He remains faithful to His covenant, turning agony into new life and captivity into freedom, pointing us to the ultimate redemption accomplished in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt go even to Babylon</span>.--This prediction has naturally caused difficulty to those who doubt the power of prophets to prophesy: for Babylon was not at all considered in the days of Micah, when Assyria was in the ascendant. It was a century after Micah's time before Babylon recovered its ancient dignity. The fact, however, remains that Micah wrote, "Thou shalt go to Babel;" and there is the other fact, that the people of Judah (not Israel) did go. Micah also declared, "THERE shalt thou be delivered:" and in the time of Cyrus the Jews were delivered there. The repetition, "There . . . there," is emphatic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be in pain.</span> The anguish is not to be resisted, but shall end, like birth pains, in deliverance.

They must leave their city, live shelterless in the open country, be carried to a distant land, even to Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall dwell in the field;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while they are making their way to the place of their captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shall go even to Babylon.</span> This is simple prophecy, and could have been known to Micah only by inspiration. In his day Assyria was the enemy whom Israel had to dread (as <a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5, 6</a>), Babylon being at this time in the position of a conquered country, and not becoming again powerful and independent for another century, So Isaiah prophesied of the captivity to Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3-8</a>), if modern critics have not shaken our faith in the genuineness of that chapter. Micah does not define the time of the Captivity, or the agents; he notes merely the place whither the Jews were at last to be deported. Even in this case "Babylon" may have its typical import, and be taken to represent the great world power arrayed against the chosen race; and the prophecy may look forward to other fulfilments in succeeding ages. Some commentators think that Babylon is here mentioned as the most distant country known, or as a portion of the Assyrian empire. Others suppose that Sargon transported some Israelitish captives to Babylon to replace the rebellious Babylonians whom he exiled to Palestine ('Records of the Past,' 7:29; <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), and that thus Micah was naturally led to represent the Judaeans as following their brethren. Whichever explanation we take, there is no reason to consider that the reference to Babylon is the interpolation of a late editor of the prophetic writings. <span class="cmt_word">There shall thou be delivered.</span> In Babylon deliverance shall arise. This prophecy was first literally fulfilled in the return from captivity under Cyrus; it is further fulfilled, under Christ, in the rescue of the true Israelites from the bondage of sin and the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Writhe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#363;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2342.htm">Strong's 2342: </a> </span><span class="str2">To twist, whirl, to dance, to writhe in pain, fear, to wait, to pervert</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in agony,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1490;&#1465;&#1435;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
