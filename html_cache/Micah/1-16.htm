This act symbolized the loss and devastation that the people were experiencing or about to experience. In the context of Micah, the prophet is calling the people to mourn for the impending judgment and exile. This practice is also seen in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>, where Job shaves his head in response to personal tragedy.<p><b>for your precious children;</b><br>The term "precious children" highlights the deep emotional bond and value placed on offspring in Israelite society. Children were seen as a blessing from God and a continuation of the family line. The impending loss of children to exile would have been a devastating blow, not only emotionally but also socially and economically. This phrase underscores the severity of the coming judgment and the personal impact it would have on families.<p><b>make yourselves as bald as an eagle,</b><br>The comparison to an eagle, likely referring to a vulture or a bird of prey known for its bald appearance, emphasizes the extent of the mourning. The imagery suggests complete and utter desolation, as the people are to strip themselves of any remaining dignity or pride. This vivid metaphor serves to communicate the totality of the impending disaster and the need for sincere repentance.<p><b>for they will go from you into exile.</b><br>The prophecy of exile is a central theme in the messages of the prophets, including Micah. The Northern Kingdom of Israel had already experienced exile at the hands of the Assyrians, and the Southern Kingdom of Judah would soon face a similar fate with the Babylonian captivity. This phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of the people's unfaithfulness to God. The exile is both a literal and spiritual separation from the land and the presence of God, echoing the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The exile also foreshadows the ultimate redemption and return, pointing to the hope of restoration through the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often straying from God's commandments and facing consequences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>A significant event where the Israelites were taken captive by foreign powers due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Represents the future generation of Israel, whose fate is a cause for mourning due to impending exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vulture.htm">Vulture</a></b><br>A symbol of desolation and mourning, used to illustrate the depth of grief the people should feel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/mourning_for_sin.htm">Mourning for Sin</a></b><br>The act of shaving the head symbolizes deep repentance and acknowledgment of sin.

In the ancient Near East, shaving the head was a well-known sign of deep sorrow (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>).<p>- God calls His people to feel what He feels over sin and looming judgment. Like a parent who instinctively mourns a child&#8217;s pain, the LORD wants Judah to experience true, heartfelt repentance rather than detached ritual (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and cut off your hair in mourning for your precious children</b><p>- The focus narrows to &#8220;your precious children,&#8221; underscoring the personal cost of rebellion. Sin never stays private; it sweeps the next generation into its wake (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>).<p>- Mourning is appropriate because judgment will separate parents from children, shattering homes and communities (<a href="/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a>).<p>- The verse reminds every parent&#8212;and every spiritual leader&#8212;that faithfulness or unfaithfulness today shapes the spiritual destiny of sons and daughters tomorrow (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Make yourselves as bald as an eagle</b><p>- Micah intensifies the imagery: total baldness, like an eagle&#8217;s head, signals irreversible loss. The bald eagle of Micah&#8217;s day (probably the vulture) looked strikingly bare, picturing stark, unembellished grief (<a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>).<p>- No half-measures are permitted. The people must embrace the full weight of what is coming, just as complete baldness leaves nothing hidden.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they will go from you into exile</b><p>- The prophecy lands here: children carried away to foreign soil (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>).<p>- Exile means:<p>&#8226; separation from the land of promise (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>),<p>&#8226; loss of temple worship (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-4</a>),<p>&#8226; daily life under pagan rulers (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-17</a>).<p>- Yet even in judgment, God&#8217;s covenant purposes continue. He will preserve a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>) and ultimately bring them home (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a> calls Judah to dramatic, visible mourning because their sin will cost them their children and their homeland. Shaved heads picture repentant hearts; baldness like an eagle amplifies total grief; exile confirms that judgment is certain. The verse warns that disobedience ripples through generations, yet God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan still stands for all who turn back to Him in genuine repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Make thee bald.</span>--Joel appeals to the land of Judah to go into deep mourning by reason of the loss of her children, slain in war or carried into captivity. The shaving of the head as a token of grief was common amongst Eastern nations, and is distinct from the idolatrous custom of cutting the hair in a peculiar shape denounced by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>, margin), and forbidden by the Jewish Law (<a href="/context/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27-28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As the eagle.</span>--The Hebrew name for eagle includes the different kinds of vultures. Entire baldness is a marked feature of the vulture.<p>The terms in which Joel speaks of the entire desolation of the cities of Judah must refer to a more complete calamity than that inflicted by Sennacherib; they rather suit the period of the Babylonian captivity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The prophet calls upon Zion to mourn for her captivity. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Make thee bald.</span> The Hebrew word implies "to make the back of the head bald." Micah addressee Zion as the mother of the children who are to be led into captivity. Shaving the head in sign of mourning seems to have been retained as a traditionary custom in spite of the prohibition of the Law against certain forms which the practice assumed (see <a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; and for the actual custom, comp. <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>; and the note on Amos 8:10). <span class="cmt_word">Poll thee.</span> Cut off thy hair, nearly synonymous with the word in the former clause. <span class="cmt_word">Thy delicate children;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the children of thy delights</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the children who are a joy and comfort to thee, the citizens of thy kingdom (comp. <a href="/micah/2-9.htm">Micah 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As the eagle</span> (<span class="accented">nesher</span>).
