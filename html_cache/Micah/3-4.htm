The people, likely the leaders and prophets of Israel, find themselves in dire circumstances and turn to God for help. This reflects a common biblical theme where people often seek God only in times of trouble. The act of crying out suggests a recognition of their need for divine intervention, reminiscent of the Israelites' cries during their bondage in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>).<p><b>but He will not answer them.</b><br>This is a sobering declaration of divine silence. God's refusal to answer is a consequence of persistent disobedience and injustice. It echoes other instances in Scripture where God withholds His response due to the people's sin, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>. This silence serves as a form of judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of their actions and the broken relationship between God and His people.<p><b>At that time He will hide His face from them</b><br>The hiding of God's face is a metaphor for the withdrawal of His presence and favor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the face of a deity symbolized blessing and protection. When God hides His face, it signifies a removal of His protective care, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>. This is a direct result of the people's actions, highlighting the conditional nature of God's covenant blessings.<p><b>because of the evil they have done.</b><br>This phrase identifies the cause of God's judgment: the people's evil deeds. The context of <a href="/micah/3.htm">Micah 3</a> reveals that the leaders and prophets were guilty of corruption, injustice, and exploitation. Their actions violated the covenantal laws and principles of justice and righteousness that God had established. This serves as a warning that divine justice is inevitable when God's people persist in sin, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of sin leading to separation from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea.
