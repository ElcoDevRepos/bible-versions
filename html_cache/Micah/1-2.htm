It emphasizes the universal scope of the prophecy, indicating that the message is not just for Israel but for all nations. This echoes the call in <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>, where Moses calls heaven and earth to witness against Israel, highlighting the seriousness of the message.<p><b>listen, O earth, and everyone in it!</b><br>The inclusion of the earth and its inhabitants underscores the comprehensive nature of the judgment. It suggests that the actions of Israel have cosmic implications, affecting not just the people but the entire creation. This reflects the biblical theme that human sin has consequences for the whole world, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where the ground is cursed because of Adam's sin.<p><b>May the Lord GOD bear witness against you,</b><br>The invocation of the Lord as a witness against the people implies a legal setting, where God is both the witness and the judge. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where God holds the people accountable to the terms of the covenant. The idea of God as a witness is also found in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>, where heaven and earth are called to hear the Lord's case against His people.<p><b>the Lord from His holy temple.</b><br>The reference to God's holy temple signifies His sovereign authority and the place from which He issues His judgments. The temple in Jerusalem was considered the earthly dwelling place of God, symbolizing His presence among His people. This phrase also points to the heavenly temple, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>, where the Lord is in His holy temple, calling all the earth to be silent before Him. The temple imagery connects to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where God's presence dwells fully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
