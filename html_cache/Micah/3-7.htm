The term "ashamed" indicates a profound sense of disgrace and failure. This shame arises because their predictions and insights are proven false or ineffective. In biblical history, true prophets were validated by the fulfillment of their prophecies (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>). The seers' shame reflects their inability to deliver true messages from God, contrasting with the genuine prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who spoke with authority and accuracy.<p><b>and the diviners will be disgraced.</b><br>Diviners were those who practiced divination, attempting to foretell the future or gain insight through supernatural means, often condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). Their disgrace comes from their reliance on false methods and their failure to provide true guidance. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the futility of trusting in human wisdom or pagan practices over divine revelation. The disgrace of the diviners underscores the superiority of God's wisdom over human attempts to control or predict the future.<p><b>They will all cover their mouths</b><br>Covering the mouth is a cultural expression of silence, shame, or mourning. In the ancient Near East, this gesture signified an acknowledgment of one's inability to speak or defend oneself, often in the face of judgment or failure. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to depict silence before divine authority (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). The seers and diviners, once vocal and confident, are now rendered speechless, highlighting their impotence and the futility of their practices.<p><b>because there is no answer from God.&#8221;</b><br>The absence of an answer from God signifies divine judgment and the withdrawal of His guidance. In the biblical narrative, God's silence often indicates disfavor or a response to persistent disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>). This silence contrasts with times when God actively communicated with His people through prophets. The lack of divine response underscores the seriousness of Israel's spiritual condition and the consequences of turning away from God. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation and communication of God to humanity (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea.

Because the so-called seers catered to those corrupt rulers, their exposure is inevitable.<p>&#8226; Shame is the fruit of falsehood. When Elijah mocked the prophets of Baal&#8212;who cried out all day with no fire from heaven&#8212;those men were publicly humbled (<a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27&#8211;29</a>). In the same way, Micah foresees the moment when counterfeit visionaries are unmasked.<p>&#8226; God has always warned His people about pretending to speak in His name. Jeremiah faced &#8220;prophets of deception&#8221; who would ultimately &#8220;be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14&#8211;16</a>; 23:25-32).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the diviners will be disgraced</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and the diviners will be disgraced.&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>b)<p>&#8226; Divination&#8212;seeking secret knowledge apart from God&#8212;was strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>).

Just as Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians finally confessed, &#8220;This is the finger of God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>), the diviners Micah addresses will have no choice but to acknowledge their defeat.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9-24</a> Simon the sorcerer believed he could purchase the Holy Spirit&#8217;s power; when confronted by Peter, he begged for mercy, illustrating how quickly worldly prestige turns to humiliation before true authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will all cover their mouths</b><p>&#8220;They will all cover their mouths &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>c)<p>&#8226; Covering the mouth is a gesture of silence and guilt.

He then turned to a medium, confirming his downfall.<p>&#8226; Micah contrasts himself with these frauds: &#8220;But as for me, I am filled with power&#8212;with the Spirit of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>).
