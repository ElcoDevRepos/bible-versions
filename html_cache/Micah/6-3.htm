Historically, God had chosen Israel as His special possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), and this question is rhetorical, inviting reflection on His faithfulness. The question echoes the language of a legal dispute, reminiscent of a courtroom setting where God is both the plaintiff and the judge. This is similar to the prophetic style found in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to reason together. The phrase challenges the Israelites to consider their history and God's consistent provision and protection, such as the deliverance from Egypt and the giving of the Law at Sinai.<p><b>Testify against Me</b><br>Here, God invites the Israelites to present any grievances they might have against Him. This is a call for accountability, emphasizing God's transparency and justice. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, legal disputes were common, and witnesses played a crucial role in establishing truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This invitation to testify is a profound expression of God's willingness to engage with His people, allowing them to voice their concerns. It also highlights the absence of any legitimate complaint against God, as He has been consistently faithful and just.<p><b>how I have wearied you!</b><br>This phrase suggests that the people might feel burdened or tired of their relationship with God, possibly due to their own misunderstanding or disobedience. The term "wearied" implies a sense of exhaustion or dissatisfaction, which could stem from the people's failure to live up to the covenantal expectations. In the broader biblical narrative, God often reminds His people of His patience and long-suffering nature (<a href="/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22-24</a>). This weariness is not due to God's actions but rather the people's rebellion and idolatry, which have led them away from the blessings of obedience. The phrase calls for introspection, urging the Israelites to recognize their own failings rather than attributing them to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea. He prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. His messages often focused on social justice and the need for true worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people of God to whom Micah is speaking. They are being called to account for their actions and attitudes towards God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, questioning His people about their grievances against Him. This rhetorical question is meant to provoke reflection and repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Micah primarily directed his prophecies. The people of Judah were often guilty of idolatry and injustice, which Micah addressed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The relationship between God and Israel, established through promises and laws.

Reflect on God's unwavering commitment to His people and consider how we might be taking His faithfulness for granted.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination_and_repentance.htm">Self-Examination and Repentance</a></b><br>The rhetorical question posed by God invites self-examination. Consider areas in your life where you may be resisting God's guidance or growing weary in your faith journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_covenant_relationship.htm">The Importance of Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Understanding the covenant relationship helps us grasp the seriousness of Israel's actions.

He uses the same familial language heard when He delivered them from Egypt and chose them as His treasured possession (see <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>). That opening phrase reminds every listener that the upcoming words flow from a Father&#8217;s heart.<p>&#8226; Relationship first&#8212;before correction comes affection.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s ownership is protective, not oppressive; He is asserting, &#8220;You belong to Me because I love you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what have I done to you?</b><p>The question is rhetorical, inviting Israel to examine whether the Lord has ever acted unjustly toward them. Scripture repeatedly encourages God&#8217;s people to recall His flawless track record (<a href="/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; No sin, no negligence, no broken promise can be charged to Him.<p>&#8226; The question exposes how unreasonable it is to drift from a perfectly faithful God.<p>&#8226; It pushes the heart to compare His deeds&#8212;salvation, provision, guidance&#8212;with any alleged grievance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Testify against Me</b><p>The scene shifts to a courtroom setting: God opens the floor for evidence against Himself (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine transparency&#8212;He is so confident in His righteousness that He invites cross-examination.<p>&#8226; Covenant accountability&#8212;God takes His own covenant stipulations seriously and allows His people to hold Him to them (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The silence of the defendant&#8217;s bench underscores His innocence; no legitimate charge can be raised.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how I have wearied you!</b><p>Israel&#8217;s complaint implied that worship and obedience were burdensome (<a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>). God highlights that accusation, asking, in essence, &#8220;When did My loving commands become a drain on you?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Weariness comes not from God&#8217;s demands but from hearts grown cold (<a href="/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; His statutes give life; rebellion produces exhaustion (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5, 31</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse unmasks the real issue: spiritual fatigue stems from sin, not from God&#8217;s goodness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/6-3.htm">Micah 6:3</a> reveals a compassionate yet confronting God who reminds His covenant people of their privileged relationship, challenges them to find any fault in His dealings, invites open testimony, and exposes the baseless claim that He is burdensome. The passage calls every reader to revisit God&#8217;s flawless faithfulness, admit any unfounded grievances, and return to wholehearted, grateful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my people.</span> The controversy takes the form of a loving expostulation; and thus in his wonderful condescension Jehovah opens the suit. <span class="cmt_word">What have I done unto thee?</span> What has occasioned thy fall from me?
