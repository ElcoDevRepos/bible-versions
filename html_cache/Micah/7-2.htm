It echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/12.htm">Psalm 12:1</a>, where the psalmist cries out for the faithful who have vanished. Historically, this could be seen during the time of Micah, when Israel and Judah were experiencing moral and spiritual decline. The absence of godly individuals suggests a society that has turned away from God's commandments, leading to widespread corruption and injustice. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect righteousness.<p><b>there is no one upright among men.</b><br>The lack of upright individuals indicates a pervasive moral decay. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>, where Abraham intercedes for Sodom, seeking even a few righteous people to spare the city. The phrase underscores the universal nature of sin, as echoed in <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10</a>, "There is no one righteous, not even one." It highlights humanity's inability to achieve righteousness on its own, pointing to the necessity of divine intervention and grace.<p><b>They all lie in wait for blood;</b><br>This imagery suggests a society filled with violence and treachery. The phrase "lie in wait for blood" implies premeditated harm and echoes the behavior of wicked individuals described in <a href="/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>. It reflects a culture where life is devalued, and murder or harm is plotted. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual death, where sin leads to separation from God, the source of life.<p><b>they hunt one another with a net.</b><br>The metaphor of hunting with a net suggests deceit and entrapment. It indicates a society where people exploit and betray each other for personal gain. This imagery is reminiscent of the tactics of the wicked described in <a href="/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>, where the wicked lie in wait to catch the helpless. It highlights the breakdown of community and trust, emphasizing the need for a shepherd, like Christ, who seeks and saves the lost, offering protection and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.

Both kingdoms were experiencing moral and spiritual decline, which Micah addresses in his prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_godly_man.htm">The godly man</a></b><br>Represents the righteous individuals who follow God's commandments.

It foreshadows the days Jesus described when &#8220;because of the multiplication of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is no one upright among men</b><p>The diagnosis deepens: &#8220;there is no one upright among men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a> quotes <a href="/bsb/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a> to confirm this universal verdict: &#8220;There is no one righteous, not even one.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a> admits, &#8220;Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Micah stresses that uprightness is absent at every level of society&#8212;kings, priests, prophets, merchants, and ordinary citizens alike (compare <a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law demanded uprightness (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>), so this sweeping failure heightens Judah&#8217;s guilt and highlights the need for divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They all lie in wait for blood</b><p>Next comes the charge of calculated violence: &#8220;They all lie in wait for blood.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8-9</a> portrays priests ambushing travelers; <a href="/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3-6</a> shows neighbors plotting harm; <a href="/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11-16</a> reveals gang-mentality greed for bloodshed.<p>&#8226; The phrase points to premeditated cruelty, not mere outbursts of anger.
