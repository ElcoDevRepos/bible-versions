These persecutions were a direct result of his commitment to spreading the Gospel. In the broader biblical context, persecution is a common theme for those who follow Christ, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a> and <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>. Paul's experiences serve as a testament to the cost of discipleship and the reality of spiritual warfare.<p><b>and the sufferings that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra</b><br>These cities were significant in Paul's missionary journeys, as recorded in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13 and 14</a>. Antioch in Pisidia was where Paul and Barnabas faced opposition from Jewish leaders, leading to their expulsion from the region (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>). In Iconium, they encountered both acceptance and hostility, resulting in a plot to stone them (<a href="/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5</a>). Lystra was particularly notable for the severe persecution Paul faced, as he was stoned and left for dead (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>). These events illustrate the physical and emotional toll of Paul's mission work and the resistance to the Gospel in the early church.<p><b>What persecutions I endured!</b><br>This exclamation underscores the intensity and frequency of the trials Paul faced. It reflects his resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity. Paul's endurance is a model for believers, echoing the call to persevere in faith despite challenges, as encouraged in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a> and <a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>. His experiences also fulfill Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><b>Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them</b><br>Paul attributes his deliverance to the Lord, emphasizing divine intervention and protection. This statement aligns with the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>. It also reflects the assurance that God provides for His servants, reinforcing the promise of His presence and aid in times of trouble. This deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ's own deliverance from death, pointing to the ultimate victory over suffering and persecution through faith in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is writing to Timothy, recounting his experiences of persecution and God's deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, a young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, being encouraged to remain steadfast in his faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>A city where Paul faced opposition and persecution during his missionary journeys.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iconium.htm">Iconium</a></b><br>Another city where Paul encountered resistance and threats to his life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lystra.htm">Lystra</a></b><br>The city where Paul was stoned and left for dead, yet he survived and continued his mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_persecution.htm">Endurance in Persecution</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s recounting of his sufferings serves as a powerful testimony of endurance.

Paul&#8217;s experiences in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra model unwavering faith under fire, while God&#8217;s repeated rescues prove His faithfulness. The verse calls us to hold the gospel tightly, expect opposition, and trust the Lord who still rescues His people today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Persecutions, afflictions.</span>--St. Paul adds to "persecutions" "afflictions"--for not merely were his plans thwarted, his hopes baffled, his friends alienated, through the persistent enmity of his opponents, but <span class= "ital">bodily</span> suffering was inflicted on him--stoning, scourging, long and weary periods of imprisonment, were among the repeated sufferings he endured for his Master's sake. The question has been asked why, out of the pages of the closely written diary of his life's experiences, does St. Paul select the events which took place at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra? Was there anything special in what he endured in these places? The most satisfactory answer seems to be that, with regard to the general reader or hearer of this Epistle, what happened in these places, years before, were good examples of what had often taken place since. These were among the first cities in which St. Paul preached in the course of his missionary journeys. But a deeper reason existed for the choice of these places in <span class= "ital">his</span> case to whom the Epistle was originally addressed. What happened on that first journey would never be forgotten by Timothy: some of the incidents were among his first experiences with St. Paul of the work--others had taken place just before St. Paul took him as his friend and associate, and, no doubt, had been often discussed in Timothy's hearing in those anxious never-to-be-forgotten hours which preceded his choice of the calling of a missionary. Hearing of these very deeds of endurance done for the crucified Master, perhaps, not a little contributed to Timothy's resolve to emulate these acts, and to join himself closely to the heroic missionary teacher. Certainly, the memory of what happened then St. Paul knew would possess a strong and weighty influence with his disciple, even though the events themselves were only such as had been repeated often since in his long life's experience. (For details respecting what took place at Antioch, &c., see Acts 13, 14)<p><span class= "bld">What persecutions I endured.</span>--Some commentators understand these words as an exclamation: "What persecution I endured!" It is, however, better simply to translate the Greek, <span class= "ital">Such persecutions as I endured; </span>in other words, Thou hast been a witness of my sufferings, such [sufferings] as I endured at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, such persecutions as I endured, but out of them, &c. Chrysostom remarks how both these clauses supply encouragement to the harassed servant of God. The first, that St. Paul displayed a noble readiness to endure persecution; the second, that God never left him alone. It was as though he said to Timothy, "surely no danger, no trouble, however great, need appall you. You know what I have gone through, yet in all God was with me and has kept me safe. Be sure He will be with you too."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Suffering</span> for <span class="accented">afflictions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">what things befell me</span> for <span class="accented">which came unto me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Persecutions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="/matthew/13-21.htm">Matthew 13:21</a>; <a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Sufferings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); usually so rendered in the A.V. (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>. etc.); rendered "afflictions" in <a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">At Antioch</span>; in Pisidia (<a href="/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14</a>). For an account of the persecutions encountered by St. Paul at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, see <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13, 14</a>. It was at St. Paul's second, or rather third, visit to Lystra that he chose Timothy for his companion (<a href="/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1-3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I endured</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>); not simply "suffered," but "underwent," willingly and firmly suffered (see <a href="/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19</a>). As regards the construction, the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f01;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is that <span class="greek">&#x1f01;</span> would limit the reference to the actual <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, but <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> extends the reference to all similar sufferings. The proper English rendering is "such as befell me." But the clause at the end of the sentence should be rendered "what great persecutions I endured." As Bengel notes, "<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> demonstrat rei gravitatem," and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> preceding the substantive with which it agrees (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), cannot be construed the same as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> the relative. The sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, is an amplification of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: "Thou hast fully known my persecutions...viz. what great persecutions I endured." <span class="cmt_word">And out of them all,</span> etc. This is added for Timothy's encouragement, that he might stand fast in the face of persecutions and sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">Delivered me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Had the apostle in his mind the clause in the Lord's Prayer, "Deliver us from evil" (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>)? Comp. <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>, where the resemblance is still more striking. Observe the testimony to Christ's omnipotence in this ascription to him, in both passages, of St. Paul's deliverance (comp. <a href="/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[my]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
