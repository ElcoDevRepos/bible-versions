This faith is not superficial but deeply rooted and authentic. The term "sincere" suggests a faith without hypocrisy, aligning with the biblical call for believers to worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of personal faith in the life of a believer, a recurring theme in Paul's epistles.<p><b>which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois</b><br>The mention of Lois, Timothy's grandmother, underscores the significance of familial influence in spiritual development. In the Jewish tradition, the family played a crucial role in religious education, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. Lois's faith is a testament to the generational transmission of belief, emphasizing the impact of a godly heritage.<p><b>and your mother Eunice</b><br>Eunice, Timothy's mother, is also noted for her faith, which she passed on to her son. This highlights the role of women in the early church and their influence in nurturing faith within the family. <a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:1</a> reveals that Eunice was a Jewish believer married to a Greek, indicating a mixed cultural background. Despite potential challenges, Eunice's faith remained steadfast, illustrating the power of a committed spiritual life.<p><b>and I am convinced is in you as well</b><br>Paul expresses confidence in Timothy's faith, affirming its continuity from previous generations. This assurance reflects the apostle's close relationship with Timothy, whom he regards as a spiritual son (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). The phrase also serves as an encouragement for Timothy to remain steadfast in his faith amidst trials, echoing the exhortation found in <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a> to hold unswervingly to the hope professed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of the Apostle Paul, Timothy is the recipient of this letter.

The apostle&#8217;s memory is stirred every time he prays for his young prot&#233;g&#233;, just as he has said a verse earlier: &#8220;I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>). Throughout his letters Paul often pauses to recall believers with gratitude (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>). Here the recollection is deeply personal:<p>&#8226;Paul&#8217;s chains make him cherish faithful partners all the more (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226;Remembering Timothy&#8217;s walk with Christ fuels Paul&#8217;s own courage to keep proclaiming the gospel (<a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>).<p>The simple phrase reminds us that Christian leaders thrive on encouraging memories of fellow believers who stay true to Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of your sincere faith</b><p>What stands out in Paul&#8217;s mind is &#8220;your sincere faith.&#8221; In <a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>, &#8220;sincere faith&#8221; is linked with love and a pure heart&#8212;no room for hypocrisy. The adjective points to faith that is:<p>&#8226;Genuine&#8212;no pretense or performance (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226;Proven&#8212;tested yet standing firm (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226;Visible&#8212;expressed in deeds as well as words (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>).<p>Paul is confident Timothy&#8217;s trust in Christ is authentic, not derivative or merely intellectual. Such sincerity is a hallmark of every believer made new by the Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice</b><p>Timothy&#8217;s faith story did not begin with him.

The verse celebrates intergenerational discipleship, the beauty of authentic, unhypocritical faith, and the encouragement believers draw from remembering how God has worked in one another&#8217;s lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee.</span>--It is for the "unfeigned faith" which he was confident dwelt still in his dearest and best loved companion, whom he had intrusted with the care of the Ephesian church, that he thanked God.

It has been suggested that Lois, Eunice, and Timothy were kinsfolk of St. Paul, hence his intimacy with the family, and his knowledge of their faith; hence, too, perhaps, his devoted and unbroken friendship for Timothy. We are told (<a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>) that this Eunice was a Jewess, married to a Greek. Lystra is no great distance from Tarsus--whence St. Paul came. The supposition is just possible; but it is only an ingenious thought, there being no data to support it.

In 4 Macc. 16:9, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I shall never be called a happy grandmother," and here (the only place where it is found in the New Testament) it has the sense of "grandmother." It is hardly a real word, and has no place in Stephens' 'Thes.,' except incidentally by comparison with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. It has, however, a classical usage. The proper word for a "grandmother" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Lois</span>; a name not found elsewhere, possibly meaning "good," or "excellent," from the same root as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This and the following Eunice are examples of the frequent use of Greek or Latin names by Jews. Eunice, we know from <a href="/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>, was a Jewess and a Christian, as it would seem her mother Lois was before her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I am reminded</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hypomn&#275;sin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5280.htm">Strong's 5280: </a> </span><span class="str2">Remembrance, recollection, putting in mind; a reminder.
