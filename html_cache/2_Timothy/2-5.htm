The term "competitor" suggests discipline, dedication, and a goal-oriented mindset. In the Greco-Roman world, athletic competitions were highly esteemed, and athletes were respected figures. This metaphor would resonate with Timothy, as Ephesus, where Timothy was based, was a city familiar with such games.<p><b>does not receive the crown</b><br>The "crown" refers to the victor's wreath awarded to winners in ancient athletic contests, such as the Isthmian or Olympic Games. This crown symbolizes eternal rewards and the ultimate prize of salvation and eternal life. In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>, Paul also speaks of an imperishable crown, contrasting it with the temporary nature of earthly rewards.<p><b>unless he competes according to the rules</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of adhering to the established guidelines, both in athletic contests and in the Christian faith. In the historical context, athletes had to undergo rigorous training and follow strict rules to qualify for competition. Similarly, Christians are called to live according to God's commandments and teachings. This is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>, where Paul discusses self-discipline and the need to run the race with purpose. The rules represent God's law and the teachings of Christ, which guide believers in their spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement to his young prot&#233;g&#233; in the faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- A young pastor and close companion of Paul, who is the recipient of this letter.

An athlete is chosen to represent the professed servant of Christ, one of those who, after long and careful training, contends in the public games, then so popular, so entirely a part of the life of every city--in the games of wrestling or running, or in the chariot-racing, or in the hand-to-hand contests.

He must, of course, submit himself to the strict rules of the theatre where the games are held, and (for this is also included in the "lawfully") must besides--if he hopes for a prize--go through all the long and severe training and discipline necessary before engaging in such a contest.
