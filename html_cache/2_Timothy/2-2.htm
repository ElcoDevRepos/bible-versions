Paul is referring to the teachings he has consistently shared, which are rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The presence of "many witnesses" underscores the public nature of these teachings, ensuring their authenticity and reliability. This aligns with the Jewish tradition of teaching in community settings, where multiple witnesses could verify the truth. The concept of witnesses is also significant in the legal and religious contexts of the time, where multiple witnesses were required to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>entrust these to faithful men</b><br>Paul instructs Timothy to pass on the teachings to "faithful men," highlighting the need for reliability and trustworthiness in those who will carry on the work of the ministry. This reflects the early church's emphasis on character and integrity in leadership, as seen in the qualifications for elders and deacons outlined in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a> and <a href="/titus/1.htm">Titus 1</a>. The term "entrust" suggests a sacred responsibility, akin to a steward managing valuable property, which in this case is the gospel message.<p><b>who will be qualified to teach others as well</b><br>The ability to teach is a critical qualification for these men, indicating that the transmission of doctrine is not just about preserving information but also about effectively communicating it to others. This reflects the rabbinic tradition of discipleship, where students were expected to become teachers themselves. The phrase "teach others as well" points to the multiplication of ministry and the perpetuation of the faith through successive generations, a principle seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the early church's growth in Acts.

The verse underscores the public, authoritative nature of Christian doctrine, the necessity of proven character in those who handle it, and the multiplying effect of discipleship that secures the church&#8217;s fidelity until Christ returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And the things that thou hast heard of me.</span>--These "things" have been often understood as referring to the few great fundamental truths rehearsed by the Apostle, in the presence of the elders of the congregation, on the occasion of Timothy's solemn ordination. "The things," then, would have been something of the nature of what is contained in a creed or profession of faith. But it is better to give to "the things" which Timothy had heard of St. Paul, and which he was to deliver to other faithful men in his turn, a much broader reference, and to understand them as comprehending far more than the narrow limits of a profession of faith could possibly contain. "The things" were, no doubt, the sum of St. Paul's teaching, the general conception of Pauline theology, which Timothy, so long the Apostle's intimate and confidential friend and disciple, was to give out to another generation of believers. It was, in fact, the "Gospel of St. Luke"--"my Gospel," as we love to think St. Paul termed that matchless summary of the life and teaching of the Blessed. It was the theology shrined in such Epistles as those once written to the Romans or Ephesians in past years. These "things" again and again, in crowded congregations, before Jewish and Christian elders, before assemblies composed of idolaters, had Timothy heard that master of his, with his winning, pleading voice, tell out among "many witnesses." Those "things" Timothy, in his turn, the voice of St. Paul the Aged being hushed, was now to commit to others.<p><span class= "bld">Among many witnesses.</span>--These, according to the above interpretation, included Pagans and Jews, the rich and poor, the untaught sinners of the Gentiles and the skilled rabbi trained in the schools of Jerusalem and Alexandria.<p><span class= "bld">The same commit thou to faithful men.</span>--Not to men merely who were "believers" in Jesus Christ. This, of course, was intended, but the "faithful men" here denoted loyal, trusty souls--men who, under no temptation, would betray the charge committed to them.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall be able to teach others also.</span>--Not only must the Christian teachers to whom Timothy is to give the commission of teaching, be trustworthy men, they must also possess knowledge and the power of communicating knowledge to others. Although the divine help was to be prayed for and expected in this and all other sacred works, yet it is noticeable how St. Paul directs that no ordinary human means of securing success must be neglected. St. Paul's last charge in these Pastoral Letters of his, directed that only those shall be selected as teachers of religion whose earthly gifts were such as fitted them for the discharge of their duties. While there is nothing in this passage to support the theory of an authoritative oral teaching, existing from the days of the Apostles, in the Church--the words of St. Paul here point to the duty of the Christian soldier, not only himself to keep unchanged and safe the treasure of the Catholic faith as taught by the Apostle, but to hand down the same unimpaired and safe to other hands.<p>The great Christian truths were never allowed to be recklessly handled. There was a school, so to speak, of Christian theology in the time of St. Paul. His dying charge directed his best beloved disciple to make careful provision for the choice and training of teachers in the congregation. Men able as well as willing, gifted as well as zealous, should be the objects of his choice.<p>Some have imagined that these directions respecting the handing down the lamp of Christian truth to others were given to Timothy with a view to his leaving Ephesus--the appointed scene of his labours--for Rome, to join the imprisoned Apostle (<a href="/2_timothy/4-9.htm" title="Do your diligence to come shortly to me:">2Timothy 4:9</a>), in which event men able as well as devoted should be left in this great centre to carry on the work of Timothy and of St. Paul. But it is far better to understand St. Paul's charge as given to Timothy, a <span class= "ital">representative</span> leader of the Church of Christ, and to understand the Apostle's words as addressed to the Church of all times. The runners in the Christian race must take good care before they fall out of the course that their torches, still burning, be handed on to the athletes who take their place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Which</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The things which thou hast heard,</span> etc. Here we have distinctly enunciated the succession of apostolical doctrine through apostolical men. We have also set before us the partnership of the presbyterate, and, in a secondary degree, of the whole Church, with the apostles and bishops their successors, in preserving pure and unadulterated the faith once delivered to the saints. There can be little doubt that St. Paul is here alluding to Timothy's ordination, as in <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6, 7, 13, 14</a>. Timothy had then heard from the apostle's lips a certain "form of sound words" - something in the nature of a creed, some summary of gospel truth, which was the deposit placed in his charge; and in committing it to him, he and the presbyters present had laid their hands on him, and the whole Church had assented, and confirmed the same. "Thus through many witnesses," whose presence and assent, like that of witnesses to the execution of a deed of transfer of land (<a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10, 16, 18</a>), was necessary to make the transaction valid and complete, had Timothy received his commission to preach the Word of God; and what he had received he was to hand on in like manner to faithful men, who should be able to teach the same to others also. <span class="cmt_word">Commit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); identifying the doctrine committed to be handed on with the <span class="accented">deposit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) of <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/1-14.htm">2 Timothy 1:14</a>. It is important to note here both the concurrence of the presbyters and the assent of the Church. The Church has ever been averse to private ordinations, and has ever associated the people as consentient parties in ordination (Thirty-first Canon; Preface to "Form and Manner of Making of Deacons," and rubric at close - "in the face of the Church;" "Form and Manner of Ordering of Priests" - "Good people," etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the things that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7939;</span> <span class="translit">(ha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
