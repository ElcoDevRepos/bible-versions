In the context of 2 Timothy, Paul warns Timothy about false teachers and those who are led astray by them. The Greek culture of the time highly valued philosophy and intellectual pursuits, often leading to endless debates and discussions. This pursuit of knowledge can be seen as a reflection of the Athenians in <a href="/acts/17-21.htm">Acts 17:21</a>, who spent their time in nothing else but telling or hearing something new. The phrase suggests a futile cycle of learning without spiritual enlightenment or transformation.<p><b>but never able to come</b><br>This part of the verse indicates an inability or failure to reach a destination or goal. In the biblical context, it implies a spiritual stagnation or blindness. Despite their efforts, these individuals are hindered by their own misconceptions or the deceit of false teachings. This echoes the warning in <a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a> about having a form of godliness but denying its power. The inability to come to the truth is often due to a hardened heart or a lack of genuine faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-22</a>, where people, although knowing God, did not honor Him.<p><b>to a knowledge of the truth.</b><br>The "knowledge of the truth" refers to the understanding and acceptance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, truth is often synonymous with the teachings of Christ and the revelation of God's will (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The truth is not merely intellectual assent but involves a transformative relationship with God. In <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>, Paul expresses God's desire for all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth, highlighting the salvific nature of this knowledge. The failure to reach this knowledge is a spiritual tragedy, as it means missing out on the salvation and freedom offered through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233;

Their own selfish inclinations, and not the grace of God, continue to be the motive power with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">always</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(pantote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3842.htm">Strong's 3842: </a> </span><span class="str2">Always, at all times, ever.
