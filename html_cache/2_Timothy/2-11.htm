In the pastoral epistles, Paul often uses this formula to emphasize key doctrinal truths. It serves as a reminder to Timothy and the early church of the foundational beliefs that are to be held with confidence. The use of "trustworthy" underscores the certainty and divine inspiration of the message that follows.<p><b>If we died with Him,</b><br>This phrase refers to the spiritual reality of believers' union with Christ in His death. It echoes <a href="/romans/6-8.htm">Romans 6:8</a>, where Paul explains that believers have died to sin through Christ's crucifixion. This death is not physical but spiritual, signifying the end of the old sinful nature and the beginning of a new life in Christ. The concept of dying with Christ is central to Christian baptism, symbolizing the believer's identification with Jesus' death and resurrection.<p><b>we will also live with Him;</b><br>This promise of living with Christ points to both present and future realities. Presently, believers experience new life through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states that Christ lives in him. This new life is characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Future fulfillment is found in the hope of resurrection and eternal life with Christ, as promised in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>, where believers will be with the Lord forever.

By calling it &#8220;trustworthy,&#8221; he signals that the line to follow is not speculation but certain, as sure as God&#8217;s own character (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). It invites Timothy&#8212;and us&#8212;to anchor our confidence here when opposition or suffering threatens to shake resolve (<a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8, 12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If we died with Him</b><p>The verb is past tense, pointing to an accomplished reality for every believer:<p>&#8226; At conversion we were united with Christ in His death. <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a> says, &#8220;all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; That union means our old self&#8212;its guilt, chains, and condemnation&#8212;was nailed to the cross (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, we now reckon ourselves &#8220;dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a>). Daily choices flow from that position: the power of sin no longer holds legal or spiritual sway (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>).<p>This clause assumes the literal, historical death of Jesus and affirms that, by faith, we truly participated in it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will also live with Him</b><p>Because death with Christ is real, life with Christ is guaranteed. Scripture connects this promise to three dimensions:<p>1. Present fellowship<p>&#8226; &#8220;Christ lives in me&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;I will come again and receive you to Myself&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19-23</a>).<p>2. Ongoing perseverance<p>&#8226; The life He supplies now empowers endurance through hardship (<a href="/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<p>3. Future resurrection<p>&#8226; &#8220;If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Because I live, you will live also&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>).<p>The promise rests on Christ&#8217;s literal resurrection; as certainly as He walked out of the tomb, we will share His immortal life (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a> reminds believers that union with Christ is both decisive and profoundly comforting. Having truly died with Him, we are already free from sin&#8217;s tyranny, and we are just as surely destined to experience His resurrection life&#8212;now in intimate fellowship, day by day in sustaining grace, and ultimately in eternal glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him.</span>--The last sentence ended with the words "eternal glory<span class= "ital">"</span>--the goal, the end of the salvation which is in Christ. This it is which the Apostle will help others to win, regardless of any suffering it may cost him; then, with his mind full of the thoughts of the "eternal glory," once more he addressed himself to Timothy. "Faithful is the saying, namely, if we be dead with him," &c. It was as though he said, "Do you not remember that well-known watchword of our own faith, so often repeated among us in our solemn assemblies when the brotherhood meet together?" Many have supposed, from the rhythmical character of the clauses of <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11-13</a>, that this "saying" was taken from some most ancient Christian hymns, composed and used in the very earliest days of the faith; but whether or no this be the case, there is high probability that the words formed part of a liturgy in common use in the days of Timothy. If not as a hymn--which seems, on the whole, the most likely supposition--we can well conceive them as part of the tapestry of a primitive Christian liturgy, woven in like the introductory sentences in our morning and evening prayer, or like the "comfortable words" of the Communion Service. The expression "If we be dead with Him"--more accurately, <span class= "ital">If we died with Him</span>--is well explained by <a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1Corinthians 15:31</a> : "I die daily." The Apostle <span class= "ital">died</span> when he embraced the lot of daily death. The meaning is still further illustrated in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a>, where we read how St. Paul and his companions were "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus." "He and his faithful companions (was Timothy, to whom he was then writing, to be ranked in this blessed company? ) had given themselves up to a life that involved exposure to sufferings, bitter enmity, cruel persecutions, even death; but if we be thus dead with Him, what matters it? How can we fear even that last agony man can inflict on us--physical death?--for <span class= "ital">death</span> with Him involves, surely, <span class= "ital">life</span> with Him too: that life endless, fadeless, full of glory, we know He is now enjoying, in the possession of which I, Paul, and some of us have even seen Him, face to face, eye to eye. In that life of His we shall share; we shall be partakers in this life of His <span class= "ital">there, </span>but only if we have shared in the life of suffering which was His life <span class= "ital">here.</span>"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">it is a faithful saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">died</span> for <span class="accented">be dead</span>, A.V.
