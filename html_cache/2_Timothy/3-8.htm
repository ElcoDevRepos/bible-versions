Although their names are not mentioned in the Old Testament, Jewish tradition and extra-biblical texts, such as the Targum of Jonathan and the Babylonian Talmud, identify them as such. This reference highlights the spiritual battle between God's truth and the deception of false teachings. The opposition to Moses symbolizes the broader resistance to God's chosen leaders and His divine plan.<p><b>so also these men oppose the truth</b><br>The "men" referred to are false teachers infiltrating the early Christian community, spreading doctrines contrary to the gospel. This opposition to the truth is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where false teachings are seen as a significant threat to the integrity of the faith (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). The truth here is the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the ultimate revelation of God's will and purpose for humanity.<p><b>They are depraved in mind</b><br>The phrase "depraved in mind" suggests a corruption of moral and spiritual understanding. In <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, Paul speaks of those whom God gave over to a depraved mind due to their rejection of Him. This depravity indicates a willful turning away from God's truth, resulting in a distorted perception of reality and morality. It underscores the seriousness of rejecting divine truth and the consequences that follow.<p><b>and disqualified from the faith</b><br>Being "disqualified from the faith" implies a failure to meet the standards of genuine Christian belief and practice. In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, Paul uses athletic imagery to describe the need for self-discipline to avoid disqualification. Here, it suggests that these false teachers have been tested and found lacking in their adherence to the true gospel. This disqualification is not merely a loss of status but a spiritual condition that separates them from the community of believers and the salvation offered through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jannes_and_jambres.htm">Jannes and Jambres</a></b><br>These are traditionally understood to be the magicians in Pharaoh's court who opposed Moses by replicating some of the miracles he performed.

No child of Israel could hear the name of Moses, the loved hero of the chosen people, unmoved; and to be told that these false teachers of Ephesus stood in the same relation to him and the Church of Christ as, in old days--in the never-to-be-forgotten Egyptian episode--those famous magicians Jannes and Jambres stood to Moses, would throw for Timothy a new light on all the words and works of these wicked and ambitious men. We can well imagine the comparison being repeated in many an assembly of the faithful, long after the great Apostle's death: how St. Paul had likened these early Heresiarchs to those evil men who before Pharaoh had dared to resist God and His servant Moses. These magicians, also termed wise men and sorcerers (<a href="/context/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11-22</a>) at the court of Pharaoh, appear as the enemies of Moses. The names "Jannes" and "Jambres," though not given in the sacred text, are preserved in the oral tradition of Israel. The names are found in the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>. These traditions relate how these men were sons of Balaam, and in the first instance were the instructors of Moses, though subsequently his enemies and opponents. One legend mentions them as perishing in the catastrophe when the waves of the Red Sea overwhelmed the armies of Egypt; another tradition speaks of their having met their death in the slaughter after the worship of the golden calf, the making of which they advised. It was their prophetic words, so say these legendary histories, which, foretelling the birth of Moses, induced Pharaoh to give this order for the destruction of the Jewish children. The later Jews distorted the names into John and Ambrose.<p><span class= "bld">So do these also resist</span> <span class= "bld">the truth.</span>--The point of comparison between the depraved teachers of Ephesus and these Egyptian sorcerers consisted in a persistent and deadly enmity to the truth, which existed in both cases. The life of the prophet Balaam, the traditionary father of this Jannes and Jambres, supplies a vivid illustration of this malignant and persistent hatred of what is known and felt to be true. That these Ephesian heretics in like manner availed themselves, or pretended to avail themselves of occult power is just probable, though in the comparison this point is of but little moment. We know, however, that the claim at least to possess mysterious and unearthly powers was often made by covetous and worldly men in these times: as, for instance, by Simon Magus (<a href="/context/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9-24</a>), by Elymas the sorcerer, the false prophet and Jew in Cyprus (<a href="/context/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6-12</a>). See also the episode of <a href="/context/acts/19-18.htm" title="And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.">Acts 19:18-20</a>, when "many which used curious arts came to Paul and his companions, and confessed and shewed their deeds." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">And like</span> for <span class="accented">now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">withstand</span> for <span class="accented">resist</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">corrupted in mind</span> for <span class="accented">of corrupt minds</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; <span class="accented">but</span> would be better. <span class="cmt_word">Jannes and Jambres;</span> the traditional names of the magicians who opposed Moses; and, if Origen can be trusted, there was an apocryphal book called by their names.
