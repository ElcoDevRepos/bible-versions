In biblical context, the Lord's presence is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd who is always with His people. The strengthening of Paul can be compared to the empowerment of other biblical figures such as David, who found strength in God during times of distress (<a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). This divine support underscores the belief that God equips His servants to fulfill their mission, reflecting the promise in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a> that God will uphold His people with His righteous right hand.<p><b>so that through me the message would be fully proclaimed</b><br>Paul's mission was to spread the Gospel, and this phrase emphasizes the completeness of his task. The "message" refers to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which Paul was commissioned to preach to the nations (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). The idea of full proclamation suggests that Paul was thorough in his ministry, ensuring that the message of salvation through Christ was clearly communicated. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to teach all nations. Paul's dedication to this task is evident in his missionary journeys and his epistles, which form a significant portion of the New Testament.<p><b>and all the Gentiles would hear it</b><br>This phrase highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel message. In the historical context, the early church grappled with the inclusion of Gentiles, as seen in the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Paul's role as the apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>) was pivotal in breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles, fulfilling the prophecy that God's salvation would reach the ends of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). This universal scope of the Gospel is a key theme in Paul's writings, emphasizing that salvation through Christ is available to all, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.<p><b>So I was delivered from the mouth of the lion</b><br>This phrase is metaphorical, often interpreted as deliverance from extreme danger or persecution. The "lion" could symbolize various threats, such as Roman authorities or hostile opponents. In a broader biblical context, lions are often used as symbols of danger or evil, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where the devil is described as a roaring lion seeking to devour. Paul's deliverance can be seen as a testament to God's protection, similar to Daniel's deliverance from the lions' den (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). This deliverance underscores the theme of divine rescue and protection for those who are faithful to God's mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote this letter to Timothy, reflecting on his experiences and the Lord's faithfulness during his trials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who provided strength and support to Paul during his time of need.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were recipients of the Gospel message through Paul's ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lion.htm">The Lion</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference, possibly indicating a dangerous situation or a specific adversary, symbolizing deliverance from peril.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_trials.htm">God's Presence in Trials</a></b><br>The Lord's presence is constant, especially in times of trial.

The strength and courage which the <span class= "ital">felt</span> presence of his Lord gave him, enabled him on that occasion, when alone, friendless, accused of a hateful crime before the highest earthly tribunal in the capital city of the world, to plead not only for himself but for that great cause with which he was identified. He spoke possibly for the last time publicly [we know nothing of the final trial, when he was condemned] the glad tidings of which he was the chosen herald to the Gentile world. It is probable that this great trial took place in the Forum, in one of the Pauline Basilicas--so called after L. 'milius Paulus. It is certain it was in the presence of a crowded audience. St. Paul evidently intimates this when he tells us how he spoke "that all the Gentiles might hear." This was apparently the culminating point of St. Paul's labours--the last stone of the laborious edifice of his life's work. Had the courage of the Apostle of the Gentiles failed him on this most momentous occasion, the spirit of the sorely-tried Church of Rome had surely sunk, and that marvellous and rapid progress of the gospel in the West--which, in a little more than a hundred years, would make its influence felt in well-nigh every city and village of the empire--had been arrested.<p><span class= "bld">And that all the Gentiles might hear.</span>--Here alluding primarily to the crowded audience which had listened on this solemn occasion to St. Paul's <span class= "ital">Apologia pro Christo; </span>but there is another and deeper reference to those uncounted peoples in the isles of the Gentiles, who, by St. Paul's work and words, would come to the saving knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span>--Expositors have, in all ages, dwelt much on the question, "Who was to be understood under the figure of the lion?" The fathers mostly believe the Emperor Nero was here alluded to. Others have suggested that St. Paul was referring to the "lions" of the amphitheatre, from whom, at all events for the time, he had been delivered. It is, however, best to understand the expression as a figurative expression for extreme danger. His Master on that dread occasion stood by him, and gave him strength and wisdom over man to speak the words of life, and delivered him for the moment out of the imminent peril threatening him, allowing him, not only to speak his Master's words there, but also thus to write this solemn farewell charge to Timothy and the Church. That such figurative language was not unusual, compare the <span class= "ital">Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, </span>iii.:8, in which writing the prisoner describes his journey from Syria to Rome as one long "fight with wild beasts," and speaks of himself as "bound to ten leopards," thus designating his soldier guards.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="accented">But</span> for <span class="accented">notwithstanding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by</span> for <span class="accented">with</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">message</span> for <span class="accented">preaching</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proclaimed</span> for <span class="accented">known</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Stood by me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>); as in <a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>; <a href="/romans/16-2.htm">Romans 16:2</a> (where see also the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a helper). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means simply to stand by the side of a person - to be present. But, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, it acquires the meaning of standing by for the purpose of helping. The contrast between the timid faithless friends who failed him like a deceitful brook (<a href="/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>), and the faithfulness of the Lord who was a very present Help in trouble, is very striking. Strengthened me (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>); see <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, note, and <a href="/acts/6-8.htm">Acts 6:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The message</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The A.V. <span class="accented">preaching</span> is far better. St. Paul means that gospel which he was commissioned to preach, and which he did preach openly in full court when he was on his trial (see ver. 15, note). <span class="cmt_word">Might be fully proclaimed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); see <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, note; and comp. <a href="/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">All the Gentiles might hear</span> (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>). The brave, unselfish spirit of the apostle thinking more of the proclamation of the gospel than of his own life, is truly admirable. <span class="cmt_word">I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> Surely there can be no doubt that, as Bengel says, this is a quotation from <a href="/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20, 21</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was delivered," comes from the twentieth verse, "Deliver my soul from the sword," and the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is found <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in ver. 21. The apostle means his deliverance from the executioner's sword. In the next verse we find both the words <span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the whole tone of the psalm breathes the same spirit as the saying, "The Lord stood by me." Dean Alford's suggestion that the lion here is Satan, as in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, and the danger which the apostle escaped was not death, which he did not fear, but betraying the gospel under the fear of death, is ingenious, but rather far fetched, though not impossible. It may possibly have been part of what was in St. Paul's mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
