This reflects the importance of repetition in teaching, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>). The early church faced many false teachings, and constant reminders helped maintain doctrinal purity. This echoes the role of the Old Testament prophets who reminded Israel of God's laws and promises.<p><b>charging them before God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the solemnity and seriousness of the charge.

Such disputes were common in the Greco-Roman world, where rhetoric was highly valued.

The focus should remain on the core message of the Gospel rather than peripheral issues.<p><b>which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin</b><br>The outcome of such quarrels is spiritual destruction rather than edification. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a> about the power of words and their potential to harm.

St. Paul has been urging Timothy to be strong in endurance, to bear trouble and suffering with brave patience. He now proceeds to charge him respecting the special work he has to do; and, first he deals with his duties as a teacher of truth brought face to face with teachers of error. He prefaces his directions by bidding him, in the forefront of his teaching, "put them" (that is, those over whom he was placed: the members of his Ephesian flock) "in remembrance of these things"--namely, of those great and solemn truths set forth in <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11-13</a>, and which may be briefly summed up in the words: "Fellowship with Christ in suffering will be succeeded by fellowship with Christ in glory." Surely such lofty, soul-inspiring thoughts as these will form the best safeguard against the pitiful controversies and disputes about words, which were occupying the thoughts and wasting the lives of so many in Ephesus called by the name of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Charging them before the Lord.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">solemnly charging them before the Lord</span> . . . In all Timothy's solemn addresses to his flock he is, St. Paul reminds him, charging his people "before the Lord"--a very earnest, solemn thought for every public teacher, and one calculated <span class= "ital">now, </span>as <span class= "ital">then, </span>to deepen the life of one appointed to such an office. There was a grave danger that such empty, profitless disputes about words and expressions, which, we know, occupied the attention of many of the Ephesian so called Christian teachers, would end in distracting the minds of the members of the several congregations, who would naturally take their tone, in matters connected with religious life, from their teacher; and thus words would soon come to be substituted for acts in the lives of those men and women called by the name of Christ in Ephesus. (See <a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm" title="He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,">1Timothy 6:4</a>, where these "strifes of words" are mentioned among the special characteristics of the false teachers.)<p><span class= "bld">But to the subverting of the hearers.</span>--Not only are such arguments and disputes useless and profitless, but they are positively mischievous. In the long history of Christianity, St. Paul's repeated warning respecting the danger of these disputes about theological terms and expressions has been sadly verified. Such contentions serve only to unsettle the mind, only to shake true faith, only to distract the one who gives himself up to this fatal pursuit, from real, earnest, patient work for Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">In the sight of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">but to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">them that hear</span> for <span class="accented">the hearers</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Put them in remembrance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12</a>). St. Paul skilfully strengthens his preceding exhortations to Timothy by now charging him to impress upon others - referring, perhaps, especially to "the faithful men" spoken of in ver. 2, but generally to the whole flock committed to him - the truths which he had just been urging upon Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">Charging</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Strive...about words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament or elsewhere. But <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a> and in late Greek. Another reading is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, as if addressed to Timothy himself, but <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is supported by the best authorities, and agrees best with the context. <span class="cmt_word">To no profit;</span> literally, <span class="accented">useful for nothing</span>; serving no good purpose. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, is found repeatedly in the LXX., and is very common in classical Greek, where it is followed by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>.

The history of its use here of a moral overthrow, which is not borne out by its classical use, seems to be that the apostle had in his mind the very common metaphor of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, edification, as the proper result of speaking and teaching, and so uses the contrary to "building up," viz. an "overthrowing" or "destruction," to describe the effect of the teaching of those vain talkers and deceivers (comp. ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Remind [ the believers ]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#956;&#957;&#8131;&#963;&#954;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hypomimn&#275;ske)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5279.htm">Strong's 5279: </a> </span><span class="str2">To remind, remember, call to mind.
