The concept of cleansing oneself is rooted in the Old Testament purification rituals, where individuals had to be ritually clean to approach God (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). In the New Testament, this cleansing is spiritual, involving repentance and turning away from sin (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). The "unfit" refers to anything that defiles or corrupts, aligning with the call to holiness found in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>. The imagery of cleansing also connects to the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><b>he will be a vessel for honor</b><br>The metaphor of a vessel is common in Scripture, symbolizing a person used by God for His purposes (<a href="/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21-23</a>). In the cultural context of the time, vessels in a household had different uses, some for honorable purposes and others for common or dishonorable tasks. Being a "vessel for honor" implies being set apart for noble use, reflecting the believer's call to live a life worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). This aligns with the idea of being chosen and precious in God's sight (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>sanctified</b><br>Sanctification is the process of being made holy, set apart for God's purposes. It is both a positional and progressive work, initiated by God but requiring human cooperation (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>). The term "sanctified" indicates a state of being consecrated, echoing the Old Testament practice of setting apart priests and sacred objects for worship (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>). In the New Testament, believers are sanctified through faith in Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>).<p><b>useful to the Master</b><br>The "Master" refers to Jesus Christ, who is Lord over all. Being "useful" implies being equipped and ready to serve His purposes. This usefulness is contingent upon the believer's willingness to be molded and directed by God (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>). The idea of being useful to the Master underscores the importance of spiritual growth and maturity, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where faithful servants are commended for their stewardship.<p><b>and prepared for every good work</b><br>Preparation for good works is a recurring theme in the New Testament, highlighting the believer's role in God's redemptive plan (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). This preparation involves being equipped through Scripture, prayer, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The phrase "every good work" suggests a comprehensive readiness to engage in acts of service, charity, and ministry, reflecting the character of Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>). It also ties into the eschatological hope of being found faithful at Christ's return (<a href="/2_peter/3-14.htm">2 Peter 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement to his young prot&#233;g&#233; in the faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- A young pastor and close companion of Paul, who is the recipient of this letter.

If <span class= "ital">he</span> would separate from all that was evil in his Church at Ephesus, then would he indeed be one of those golden vessels unto honour. The image of the great house, and its many and varied vessels, though still not quite lost sight of, is passing out of sight. This verse changes into a note of direct exhortation. The good and faithful must separate themselves from the evil and faithless. The thought of those deniers of the resurrection of the body was uppermost in St. Paul's mind. There must, as it has been well said, be no communion on the part of God's servants with impugners of fundamentals. It was imperatively necessary for Timothy--and, by implication, for all members of Christ's Church--if they aimed at becoming vessels for honour in the great Temple, to break off from all Church fellowship, from all intimate friendship, with those above referred to under the image of wooden or earthen vessels.<p><span class= "bld">He shall be a vessel unto honour.</span>--Chrysostom's note upon these words is somewhat remarkable. He points out the possibility of the vessel for dishonour becoming a vessel for honour, and the reverse; and refers to St. Paul, once an earthen vessel, who became a vessel of gold, and to the traitor Judas, who, on the other hand, from being a vessel of gold became an earthen vessel.<p><span class= "bld">Meet for the master's use.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">useful for the master</span> (of the house). "Useful," as the next sentence shows us, through those good works by means of which others' needs are ministered to, and the salvation of others is furthered, and the glory of God is increased.<p><span class= "bld">Prepared unto every good work.</span>--"Prepared"--that is, ready to take advantage of any opportunity which may offer itself to do a generous, noble action. So, too, Chrysostom, who would have the "vessel unto honour" ready for every emergency which would enhance the glory of the Lord--ready even for death, or (any painful) witness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="accented">Meet</span> for <span class="accented">and meet</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">prepared</span> for <span class="accented">and prepared</span>, A.V.

The idea, therefore, seems to be that of <span class="accented">separation</span>, and, if so, "from these" may certainly mean from the false teachers described under the image of the vessels unto dishonour, as usually explained. At the same time, the image is better sustained if we understand "from these" to mean the babblings, and ungodliness, and eating words of the heretics denounced. It is hardly natural to imply that one vessel in the house will become a golden vessel by purging itself from the wooden and earthen vessels. Neither is separation from the false teachers the point which St. Paul is here pressing, but avoidance of false doctrines. <span class="cmt_word">Meet for...use</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and ch. 4:11 and <a href="/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11</a>.
