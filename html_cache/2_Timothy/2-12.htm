The Greek word used here, "hypomen&#333;," suggests a steadfastness under pressure. This concept is echoed in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where those who persevere under trial are promised the crown of life. Historically, early Christians faced significant persecution, and endurance was essential for maintaining their faith. The call to endure is also a reminder of Jesus' own endurance, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, where He endured the cross for the joy set before Him.<p><b>we will also reign with Him;</b><br>The promise of reigning with Christ is a future hope for believers, pointing to the eschatological reign of Jesus. This is consistent with <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4-6</a>, where those who have been faithful are described as reigning with Christ for a thousand years. The concept of reigning with Christ also ties back to the idea of believers being co-heirs with Him, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>. This reign is not just a future reality but also reflects the spiritual authority believers have in Christ even now, as they live out His kingdom values on earth.<p><b>if we deny Him,</b><br>Denial of Christ is a serious matter, as it reflects a rejection of His lordship and salvation. This phrase recalls Peter's denial of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-69.htm">Matthew 26:69-75</a>), which serves as a sobering reminder of human frailty. However, Peter's subsequent repentance and restoration highlight the possibility of forgiveness. The cultural context of the early church included pressures to deny Christ, especially under Roman persecution, where confessing Jesus as Lord could lead to martyrdom. This warning serves as a call to remain faithful even under duress.<p><b>He will also deny us;</b><br>This phrase underscores the reciprocal nature of the relationship between Christ and believers. It echoes Jesus' own words in <a href="/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>, where He states that whoever denies Him before others will be denied before the Father. The denial here is not merely a passive act but a judicial one, reflecting the final judgment. It serves as a warning of the eternal consequences of rejecting Christ. This is consistent with the biblical theme of covenant, where faithfulness is required from both parties. The denial is not arbitrary but a just response to one's own choices regarding faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement to his young prot&#233;g&#233;.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, recipient of the letter, tasked with leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its challenges, including false teachings and persecution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the Christian faith, with whom believers are called to endure and reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The context of suffering and trials faced by early Christians, which Paul addresses in his letters.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_faith.htm">Endurance in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to endure hardships and remain steadfast in their faith.

Faithful endurance, enabled by Christ, ends in shared rule with Him. Persistent denial, however, ends in His denying the denier. The verse calls believers to steadfast loyalty, confident in the reward of reigning with Jesus and soberly aware of the cost of rejecting Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.</span>--And the faithful saying went on with this stirring declaration. How, it seems to ask, can a believer in Christ shrink from suffering, when he knows what to him will be the glorious consequences of this present suffering? The word rendered "suffer" would be better translated, <span class= "ital">if we endure</span>--that is, if we bravely bear up against sufferings for His sake, and all the while work on with hand and brain for Him and for our brother as best we can. If we do this in this life, we shall, in the life to come, reign with Him--more than merely <span class= "ital">live</span> with Him, as the last verse told us: we shall even "be kings with Him." (See <a href="/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; and <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>, where Jesus Christ is especially spoken of as having made us "kings.") The promise thus woven into the faithful saying, and repeated in these several passages, of the "reign of the saints in Christ," gives us a strangely glorious hope--a marvellous on-look, concerning the active and personal work which Christ's redeemed will be intrusted with in the ages of eternity.<p><span class= "bld">If we deny him, he also will deny us.</span>--But there is another side to the words of the Blessed. While to the faithful and the believer He will grant to sit down with Him on His throne, the faithless and unbeliever will have no share in the glories of the life to come. These grave warnings are apparently addressed rather to unfaithful members of the outward and visible Church, than to the Pagan world who have never known Christ. The words, "He also will deny us," imply something of a recognition on the part of us who are denied by Him--something of an expectation on our part that He would recognise us as friends. They are evidently an echo of the Lord's own sad reply to those many who will say to Him in that day, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? . . . and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity."
