The Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, foresees a period when the church will face challenges from within. This aligns with other biblical prophecies about end times, such as those found in <a href="/matthew/24-10.htm">Matthew 24:10-12</a>, where Jesus speaks of many falling away and false prophets arising. The urgency in Paul's message suggests that this is not a distant future but an imminent threat.<p><b>when men will not tolerate sound doctrine</b><br>The term "sound doctrine" refers to the healthy, uncorrupted teaching of the Gospel. In the early church, maintaining doctrinal purity was crucial, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching. The rejection of sound doctrine implies a turning away from foundational truths, similar to the warnings in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a> about deserting the true Gospel. This reflects a cultural shift where truth becomes subjective, and absolute truths are dismissed.<p><b>but with itching ears</b><br>"Itching ears" is a metaphor for people who desire to hear only what pleases them, rather than the truth. This phrase suggests a self-centered approach to teaching, where individuals seek affirmation rather than transformation. In the Greco-Roman world, rhetoric and philosophy were highly valued, and speakers often tailored their messages to gain popularity, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-21.htm">Acts 17:21</a>, where Athenians spent time discussing new ideas. This cultural context highlights the danger of prioritizing novelty over truth.<p><b>they will gather around themselves teachers</b><br>This indicates a deliberate action to select leaders who conform to personal preferences rather than divine truth. The early church faced similar issues, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>, where factions formed around different leaders. This behavior undermines the unity and authority of the church, as believers are called to follow Christ, not human leaders. The gathering of teachers reflects a consumer mentality, where spiritual leaders are chosen based on their ability to entertain or appease.<p><b>to suit their own desires</b><br>This phrase underscores the self-indulgent nature of those rejecting sound doctrine. It echoes the warning in <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>, where people exchanged the truth of God for a lie, worshiping created things rather than the Creator. The focus on personal desires over divine will is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the human tendency to prioritize fleshly desires over spiritual obedience. This self-centeredness is contrary to the call to deny oneself and follow Christ, as stated in <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and warnings about future challenges in the church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, recipient of the letter, tasked with maintaining sound doctrine in the church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was likely ministering, known for its diverse and sometimes conflicting religious practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who distort or reject sound doctrine to cater to the desires of their audience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The body of believers who are warned to remain steadfast in true teaching despite external pressures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_sound_doctrine.htm">The Importance of Sound Doctrine</a></b><br>Sound doctrine is essential for spiritual health and growth.

The great drag-net of the Church, in its wide sweep, would keep drawing into its meshes something of every kind. Errors now just apparent, he must remember, would attain more formidable dimensions. The thirst for novelties in doctrine, the desire for a teaching which, while offering peace to a troubled conscience, would yet allow the old self-indulgent life to go on as before, would increase. In full view of this development of error, in sure expectation of a future full of anxious care, Timothy and his brother teachers must indeed be wakeful, watchful, and earnest in their preaching and ministrations. And the thought that more and ever more of the so-called Christians would dislike the preaching of the "sound doctrine," as taught by the Apostle, the very knowledge of this growing unpopularity, must serve <span class= "ital">as</span> an incentive to greater labour, more interest, and more loving activity on the part of Timothy and his companions.<p><span class= "bld">But after their</span> <span class= "bld">own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers.</span>--"Their own lusts:" this expression gives us some insight into the reason which led to this future apostasy of so many, concerning which St. Paul warned Timothy. "Their own lusts," which, at all risks, they would gratify, would serve to alienate them from that severe and strictly moral school of Apostolic teaching, in which the sternest morality was bound up with purity of doctrine, to which school St. Paul's pupils--men like Timothy and the presbyters of Ephesus--belonged. These worldly ones to whom St. Paul referred, reluctant to part with the hope Christianity taught, and unwilling to live the life which St. Paul and Timothy insisted upon as necessary to be lived by all those who would share in that glorious hope, sought out for themselves more indulgent teachers, who would flatter and gratify their hearers with novelties in doctrine, and would, at the same time, lay comparatively little stress on the pure and saintly life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">The sound</span> for <span class="accented">sound</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts</span> for <span class="accented">after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The sound</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). Nothing is gained by the addition of the article in English.

In classical Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is frequently applied to words, sentiments, advice, etc., in the sense of "sound," "wise;" and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is also applied to the mind and character. <span class="cmt_word">Endure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); usually, as Bishop Ellicott observes, applied by St. Paul to persons as the object, as elsewhere in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/17-17.htm">Matthew 17:17</a>; <a href="/acts/18-14.htm">Acts 18:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>, etc.); but not invariably (see <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; so too <a href="/hebrews/13-22.htm">Hebrews 13:22</a>). In classical Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, followed by persons or things, usually governs an accusative case, if any, but a genitive frequently in Plato. <span class="cmt_word">Having itching ears</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament.

The simple <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in ch. 3:6. <span class="cmt_word">After their own lusts.</span> The measure of the number or the quality of their self-chosen teachers will be their own insatiable and ever-varying fancies and mental appetites, not the desire to be taught God's truth by teachers sent from God.
