Onesiphorus is mentioned as a faithful supporter of Paul, suggesting a strong bond between them. The request for mercy upon his household indicates the value placed on family units within the early church. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's mercy, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>, where God is described as merciful and gracious. The mention of a household also underscores the communal aspect of early Christian communities, where entire families often converted together, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a> with the Philippian jailer.<p><b>because he has often refreshed me</b><br>The act of refreshing Paul suggests physical, emotional, and spiritual support. In the context of Paul's imprisonment, this could include providing food, companionship, or encouragement. The Greek word used here for "refreshed" implies a repeated action, indicating Onesiphorus's consistent support. This reflects the Christian virtue of hospitality and service, as encouraged in <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>. The support of fellow believers was crucial for Paul, who often faced isolation and hardship, as seen in his other epistles.<p><b>and was unashamed of my chains</b><br>This phrase highlights Onesiphorus's courage and loyalty. In the Roman world, association with a prisoner, especially one like Paul who was imprisoned for his faith, could lead to social stigma or even danger. Onesiphorus's lack of shame contrasts with others who may have abandoned Paul, as mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15</a>. This reflects the biblical theme of not being ashamed of the Gospel, as Paul writes in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>. Onesiphorus's actions exemplify the call to bear one another's burdens, as instructed in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, and to stand firm in faith despite persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/onesiphorus.htm">Onesiphorus</a></b><br>A Christian from Ephesus who showed kindness and support to Paul during his imprisonment.

Mercy encompasses forgiveness, relief, and lovingkindness&#8212;everything a struggling believer&#8217;s household might need. Paul&#8217;s prayer echoes his greeting in the same letter, &#8220;Grace, mercy, and peace&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>), underscoring that divine mercy remains the bedrock of Christian endurance (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the household of Onesiphorus</b><p>Paul singles out an entire family, not just one man. Scripture consistently shows God&#8217;s favor extending beyond individuals to their homes&#8212;think of Rahab (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>), Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2, 24</a>), and the Philippian jailer (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a>). Timothy is urged later, &#8220;Greet Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>), affirming their ongoing faithfulness. When believers serve Christ&#8217;s body, their relatives often taste the blessing, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>, &#8220;The descendants of the righteous will be delivered.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he has often refreshed me</b><p>&#8220;Refreshed&#8221; suggests repeated acts of practical care&#8212;food, lodging, companionship, advocacy. Similar language appears in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17-18</a> and <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a>, where Paul thanks others who &#8220;refreshed the hearts of the saints.&#8221; Onesiphorus&#8217;s service wasn&#8217;t a one-time gesture; it was habitual (&#8220;often&#8221;). Such ministry mirrors Jesus&#8217; promise that whoever gives even &#8220;a cup of cold water&#8221; in His name will not lose his reward (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). It also fulfills <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, &#8220;Whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was unashamed of my chains</b><p>In Rome, association with a condemned apostle could invite ridicule or danger, yet Onesiphorus &#8220;was unashamed.&#8221; Paul earlier urges Timothy, &#8220;Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>). Onesiphorus embodies that charge, much like Epaphroditus who risked his life to aid Paul (<a href="/philippians/2-29.htm">Philippians 2:29-30</a>). By honoring a chained apostle, he honors Christ Himself (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36, 40</a>). His courage contrasts those who deserted Paul in fear (<a href="/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15</a>). The chain might bind Paul&#8217;s wrists, but &#8220;the word of God is not chained&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>); Onesiphorus&#8217;s bold loyalty testifies to that truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s brief prayer in <a href="/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a> highlights three timeless lessons: God&#8217;s mercy is abundant and available; faithful service to Christ&#8217;s servants brings blessing on entire households; and courageous, repeated acts of refreshment for the imprisoned and persecuted delight the Lord. Onesiphorus stands as a model disciple&#8212;loyal, compassionate, and unashamed&#8212;showing how everyday faithfulness secures eternal commendation from the God who loves to grant mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus.</span>--In striking contrast to those false friends who turned away from him was one, also well known to Timothy, probably an Ephesian merchant. Onesiphorus, to whose house the Apostle prays the Lord to give mercy, had, early in this last imprisonment of St. Paul, arrived in Rome on matters connected probably with business. There he heard of the arrest of that great master whom he had known well in Asia, and sought him out in his prison. There is but little doubt that when St. Paul wrote this Epistle Onesiphorus' death must have recently taken place, both from the terms of this verse--where mercy is prayed, not for him, but for his house--and also from the expression "in that day," used in <a href="/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2Timothy 1:18</a>. There is something strangely touching in this loving memory of "one" who, in his trouble, did <span class= "ital">not</span> forsake him, but whose devotion was rather increased by his danger, and this <span class= "ital">one</span> faithful friend would never be able again to show his love to the prisoner, for God had called him home.<p><span class= "bld">For he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain.</span>--"He oft refreshed me" does not imply that he ministered only to the Apostle's bodily needs when he was in prison, though the word, no doubt, includes this. But "he refreshed" him by frequent visits, by, no doubt, much anxious forethought in the matter of St. Paul's deliverance from prison and bonds, by a noble disregard of the personal danger which he incurred by his open intimacy with a prisoner charged, as St. Paul must have been, with treason against the empire. "<span class= "ital">He</span> was not ashamed of my chain." (See <a href="/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>, where "the chain" of another captivity is mentioned.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Grant</span> for <span class="accented">give</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Grant mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>).

It is inferred from this expression, coupled with that in <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, that Onesiphorus himself was no longer living; and hence ver. 18 (where see note) is thought by some to be an argument for prayers for the dead. The inference, further strengthened by the peculiar language of ver. 18, though not absolutely certain, is undoubtedly probable. The connection between this and the preceding verse is the contrast between the conduct of Phygelus and Hermogenes and that of Onesiphorus. They repudiated all acquaintance with the apostle in his day of trial; he, when he was in Rome, diligently sought him and with difficulty found him. and oft refreshed him with Christian sympathy and communion, acting with no less courage than love. He was no longer on earth to receive a prophet's reward (<a href="/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>), but St. Paul prays that he may receive it in the day of Christ, and that meanwhile God may requite to his family the mercy he had showed to St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Refreshed me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">revived me</span>.
