In the context of 2 Timothy, Paul is addressing false teachings and the assurance that despite these, God's truth remains unaltered. The "firm foundation" can be seen as the church itself, built on the teachings of the apostles and prophets, with Christ as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). This foundation is not just a physical structure but a spiritual one, representing the enduring truth of the Gospel.<p><b>bearing this seal: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are His,&#8221;</b><br>The concept of a "seal" in biblical times often indicated ownership and authenticity. Here, it signifies God's intimate knowledge and ownership of His people. This echoes the Old Testament, where God declares His knowledge of His chosen ones, such as in <a href="/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>, where Moses states that the Lord will show who belongs to Him. This assurance provides comfort to believers, affirming that God recognizes and claims them as His own, despite external challenges or false teachings.<p><b>and, &#8220;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the ethical and moral response expected from those who belong to God. Calling on the name of the Lord is a sign of faith and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a> and <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>. However, true faith is evidenced by a life that turns away from sin. This call to holiness is consistent throughout Scripture, where genuine repentance and transformation are marks of a believer's life (<a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>). It highlights the transformative power of the Gospel, which not only saves but also sanctifies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement to his young prot&#233;g&#233; in the faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, entrusted with leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse culture and challenges to the early Christian community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine authority whose foundation is described as firm and unshakeable.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His intimate knowledge of His followers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unshakeable_foundation.htm">God's Unshakeable Foundation</a></b><br>God's foundation is described as firm, indicating the stability and reliability of His promises and truth.

In other words, the Church of Christ is here considered as the foundation of a far grander building, which, in the fulness of time, will rest upon its massive work (see <a href="/context/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>)<span class= "ital">., </span>and this ground-storey, the corner-stone of which is Christ, "standeth" age after age, in spite of any efforts which may be made to destroy or even to shake it. The term "foundation," here used for the Church of God on earth, is remarkable, and points to a great truth: that, after all, this life is but a beginning, and that "His Church" here is but a foundation--is only the first and early storey of that glorious Church the Divine Architect has planned, and will complete in heaven.<p><span class= "bld">Having this seal.</span>--It was a custom, which dates back from the very earliest times, to inscribe upon a building or a monument an inscription which told of its origin and purpose. In some cases, as in the oldest monuments of Egypt, the engraved writing told the name of the royal or priestly builder; so in <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>, we read how in the wall of the City of God there were twelve foundations, and on them were engraved the names of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb. On this "foundation storey," of which St. Paul was now speaking, was carved a legible inscription in two sentences--the one told of comfort and hope, reminding men God would ever know "His own;" the other told of duty, reminding men that "God's own" had no share in unrighteousness. It is called "a seal" here instead of an inscription, for a seal best conveys the idea of the solemn binding character of the writing.<p>The Jew was especially accustomed to see the words and promises of his God written or graven on his doorposts and on his gates. (See <a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm" title="And you shall write them on the posts of your house, and on your gates.">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-20.htm" title="And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>. See, too, the words of <a href="/job/19-24.htm" title="That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!">Job 19:24</a>, where he would have his most solemn declaration of faith graven or sealed on a rock for ever.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">Howbeit</span> for <span class="accented">nevertheless</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">firm foundation of God standeth</span> for <span class="accented">foundation of God standeth sure</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">the</span> (1611 copy), A.V.; <span class="accented">the Lord</span> for <span class="accented">Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">unrighteousness</span> for <span class="accented">iniquity</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The firm foundation of God standeth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, though the faith of some is thrown down like a wall built with untempered mortar, the foundation which God has laid fast and firm stands unmoved and unmovable. This is equally true of individual souls (the at <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> of Chrysostom), and of the Church, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail. Compare our Lord's saying, when the Pharisees were offended at him, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up" (<a href="/matthew/15-13.htm">Matthew 15:13</a>); and those in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28, 29</a>; and <a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in classical Greek is always an adjective agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> expressed or understood. In the New Testament it is used only as a substantive (<a href="/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-19.htm">1 Timothy 6:19</a>, etc.). Here the word seems to be employed, not so much to denote a foundation on which a house was to be built, as to denote strength and solidity. The elect of God are like foundationstones, which may not be moved. <span class="cmt_word">Having this seal.</span> In <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> the twelve foundationstones of the new Jerusalem were each inscribed with the name of an apostle. In like manner there are inscriptions, of the nature of seals, on God's strong foundations, showing their immutable condition. One is, "THE LORD KNOWETH THEM THAT ARE HIS," taken <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from the LXX. of <a href="/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>: the other is, "LET EVERY ONE THAT NAMETH THE NAME OF THE LORD DEPART FROM UNRIGHTEOUSNESS," This is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament. The first part of the verse is indeed equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>, but there is nothing to answer to the second part. The passages quoted by commentators from <a href="/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a> and <a href="/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a> are far too general to indicate any particular reference. Possibly the motto is one of those "faithful sayings" before referred to. The two inscriptions, taken together, show the two sides of the Christian standing - God's election, and man's holiness (comp. <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(mentoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3305.htm">Strong's 3305: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) indeed, really, (b) yet, however, nevertheless.
