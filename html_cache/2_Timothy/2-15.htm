In the context of Paul's letters, it reflects the urgency and commitment required in the Christian life. The Greek word used here, "spoudaz&#333;," implies a zealous and earnest pursuit. This aligns with other scriptural exhortations to be diligent, such as in <a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm">Hebrews 4:11</a>, where believers are encouraged to strive to enter God's rest.<p><b>to present yourself approved to God</b><br>The concept of being "approved" suggests a testing or proving process, akin to refining metals. In biblical times, metals were tested for purity, and only those that passed were deemed valuable. Similarly, believers are called to live in a way that meets God's standards, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>, where Paul urges believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.<p><b>an unashamed workman</b><br>The imagery of a workman or laborer is common in the New Testament, reflecting the idea of serving God with integrity and skill. In the cultural context of the early church, a workman would be someone who is skilled and reliable, not needing to hide or be ashamed of their work. This is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>, where Paul speaks of building on the foundation of Christ with care.<p><b>who accurately handles the word of truth</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of correctly interpreting and teaching Scripture. The Greek term "orthotome&#333;" means to cut straight, akin to a craftsman cutting a straight path or a farmer plowing a straight furrow. This calls for precision and care in handling God's word, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, where the Bereans are commended for examining the Scriptures daily to verify Paul's teachings.

Then their work would be the work of workmen tested by trial, and would be found to have stood the test. (Comp. here <a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-15</a>, where the final testing of the work done by God's workmen, such as Timothy, is spoken of in very clear, heart-searching language.) His own words in the First Epistle to the Corinthians were evidently in St. Paul's mind when he wrote down this direction to Timothy.<p><span class= "bld">Rightly dividing the word of truth.</span>--Better rendered <span class= "ital">rightly laying out the word of truth.</span> The Greek word translated in the English version "rightly dividing," literally signifies "cutting a straight line." It seems most correct to regard it as a metaphor from laying out a road (see <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm" title="In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.">Proverbs 3:6</a>, in the LXX. rendering, where the word is so used), "or drawing a furrow, the merit of which consists in the straightness with which the work of cutting, or laying out, is performed. The word of truth is, as it were, a road which is to be laid out straightly and truly." So Ellicott. To affirm (see Alford and Huther-Meyer) that the notion of "cutting" had been gradually lost, and that the word already in the time of St. Paul signified simply "to manage rightly," "to treat truthfully without falsifying," and that the exact opposite is to corrupt or adulterate the Word of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>), seems premature. (Comp. Eur. <span class= "ital">Rhesus, </span>422, ed. Dindorf.)<p>In the third century, Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Stromata, </span>7), for instance, certainly uses the word in a sense in which the idea of "cutting" has been lost, when he writes <span class= "ital">orthotomia</span> (a substantive) as an equivalent for <span class= "ital">orthodoxia</span>--orthodoxy. It is not improbable that the use of the word here by St. Paul gave the word a fresh starting-point, and that gradually the original meaning passed out of sight.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Give diligence to present</span> for <span class="accented">study to show</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">handling aright</span> for <span class="accented">rightly dividing</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Give diligence.</span> The A.V.

In <a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a> it has the sense of "to commend," nearly the same as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The rendering, <span class="accented">to show thyself</span>, of the A.V. is a very good one, and is preserved in the R.V. of <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Approved</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; <a href="/romans/16-10.htm">Romans 16:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>, etc.); one that has been tried and tested and found to be sterling; properly of metals. This, with the two following qualifications, "a workman that needeth not to be ashamed," and "one that rightly handles the Word of truth," is the character which Timothy is exhorted to appear in before God. The dative <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> is governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">A workman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>). How natural is such a figure in the mouth of Paul, who <span class="accented">wrought</span> at his trade with Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>), and was <span class="accented">working</span> night and day at Thessalonica, that he might earn his own living! <span class="cmt_word">That needeth not to be ashamed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); not found anywhere else, either in the New Testament or in the LXX., or in classical Greek. Bengel hits the right force of the word when he renders it "non pudefactum," only that by the common use of the passive participial form (compare <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.), it means further "that cannot be put to shame." The workman whose work is skimped is put to shame when, upon its being tested, it is found to be bad, dishonest work; the workman whose work, like himself, is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, honest, conscientious, good work, and moreover sound and skilful work, never has been, and never can be, put to shame. St. Paul shows how to secure its being good work, viz. by its being done for the eye of God. <span class="cmt_word">Handling aright the Word of truth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament. In the LXX., in <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>, it stands for "he shall <span class="accented">direct</span> [or 'make straight'] thy paths;" and so in <a href="/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>. The idea is the same as that in <a href="/hebrews/12-13.htm">Hebrews 12:13</a>, "Make straight paths for your feet (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)." But this does not at all suit the context. We must look, therefore, at the etymology of the word. <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;</span> must mean "to cut straight," and, as the apostle is speaking of a good workman, he must be thinking of some work in which the workman's skill consists in cutting straight: why not his own trade, in which it was all-important to cut the pieces straight that were afterwards to be joined to each other (see <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">?</span> Hence, by an easy metaphor, "divide rightly," or "handle rightly, the Word of truth," preserving the true measure of the different portions of Divine truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Make every effort</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#960;&#959;&#973;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Spoudason)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4704.htm">Strong's 4704: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hasten, be eager, be zealous.
