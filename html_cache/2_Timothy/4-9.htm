Paul is expressing a strong desire for Timothy to prioritize this request. In the context of Paul's life, he is nearing the end of his ministry and facing execution, which adds weight to his plea. The Greek word used here, "spoudason," conveys diligence and eagerness, suggesting that Timothy should act with haste and commitment. This reflects the urgency often found in Paul's letters, where he encourages believers to be diligent in their faith and actions (<a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>).<p><b>to come to me</b><br>Paul is imprisoned in Rome, likely during his second imprisonment, and he longs for the companionship and support of his spiritual son, Timothy. This request highlights the deep personal relationship between Paul and Timothy, as well as the importance of fellowship and support within the Christian community. The request also underscores the isolation Paul feels in his imprisonment, as many have deserted him (<a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>). The need for personal presence and encouragement is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-24</a>).<p><b>quickly</b><br>The urgency of this request is underscored by the word "quickly." Paul is aware that his time is short, as he anticipates his impending martyrdom (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6-8</a>). The historical context of this letter, written during the persecution of Christians under Emperor Nero, adds to the urgency. Paul desires to see Timothy one last time, to impart final instructions and encouragement. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the brevity of life and the importance of making the most of the time we have (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, writing from a Roman prison.

Who would ever have dreamed of putting into the letter such a request as this, <span class= "ital">after</span> those solemn expressions of the last few verses, in which the Apostle spoke of himself as even <span class= "ital">then</span> tasting the bitterness of death? He had been writing as though the martyr's death was so imminent that the preparations were already being made for it. This request to Timothy to come to him, <span class= "ital">after</span> he had written such thoughts down, is at first sight strange, and one certainly which no forger would have appended to the writing. But though the forger would never have thought of such a summons, <span class= "ital">St. Paul</span> might. He still lived, and the thought of life and the hope of life even in that brave Christ-loving heart still burned; after all, the martyrdom which seemed so close at hand <span class= "ital">might</span> be delayed. Days, months, might drag on their slow, weary length, and still find the old man languishing and solitary in his chains in that dreary prison. He longed to see some of his faithful companions once more, and for the last time to bid them with his own mouth to be faithful and brave. So, as it were, hoping against hope, he dictates on the last pages of the letter, "Do thy diligence," or better, "<span class= "ital">earnestly endeavour</span> to come shortly to me." His loving wish to see Timothy again appears from the words of <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a> : "greatly desiring to see thee;" and again from <a href="/2_timothy/4-21.htm" title="Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.">2Timothy 4:21</a>. "Do thy diligence to come before winter." And some have seen in the expression, "being mindful of thy tears," in <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a> (to which we have given, however, a different interpretation), a reciprocal anxiety on the part of Timothy to see and speak again with his old master. But St. Paul, though he begged him to hasten his journey as much as possible, and still, though all seemed so dark around him, <span class= "ital">hoped</span> to see him again, framed the charge of the last letter in such a way that Timothy, if when he reached Rome, should find that all was over, might know what were his master's last wishes and directions. On the natural human longing for sympathy in the supreme hour, compare our blessed Lord's words to Peter, James, and John (<a href="/matthew/26-38.htm" title="Then said he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry you here, and watch with me.">Matthew 26:38</a>): "My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, <span class= "ital">and</span> <span class= "ital">watch with Me.</span>"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do thy diligence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); see ch. 2:15, note.
