In the context of the early church, there were individuals who adhered to religious rituals and traditions but lacked genuine faith and transformation. This echoes Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>, where He criticized them for being like whitewashed tombs&#8212;beautiful on the outside but full of dead bones inside. The emphasis is on the superficiality of their faith, which is not rooted in a true relationship with God.<p><b>but denying its power</b><br>The power referred to here is the transformative power of the Holy Spirit and the gospel, which brings about true change in a believer's life. This denial can be seen in a lifestyle that contradicts the teachings of Christ, despite outward religious observance. In <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>, Paul states, "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power." This highlights the importance of a faith that is not just spoken but lived out through the power of God working within.<p><b>Turn away from such as these!</b><br>Paul's instruction to "turn away" is a call for separation from those who profess faith but live in contradiction to its principles. This aligns with the biblical principle of holiness and the call to be set apart, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, "Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord."

Outward appearance, however, is not the test of true faith. Jesus described similar people in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27&#8211;28</a>, where the Pharisees appeared righteous but were &#8220;full of hypocrisy and wickedness.&#8221; Genuine godliness flows from a transformed heart (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>), not merely exterior rituals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of godliness</b><p>&#8220;Godliness&#8221; points to a life aligned with God&#8217;s character, revealed perfectly in Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>). It embraces reverence, obedience, and love. Real godliness is more than moral respectability; it is the life of Christ reproduced in believers through the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). By limiting godliness to a facade, these individuals empty it of the holiness and humility that accompany saving faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But denying its power</b><p>The power they reject is the dynamic work of the Holy Spirit who changes hearts and enables obedience (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11&#8211;14</a>).

These, by claiming the title of Christians, wearing before men the uniform of Christ, but by their lives dishonouring His name, did the gravest injury to the holy Christian cause. Another dreary catalogue of vices St. Paul gives in the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>, and following verses); but in that passage he paints the sins of Paganism. Here he describes the characteristics of a new Paganism, which went under the name of Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">From such turn away.</span>--<span class= "ital">These, </span>daring to assume the sacred name, no doubt with the thought of claiming its glorious promises, without one effort to please the Master or to do honour to His name--<span class= "ital">these</span> were to be openly shunned by such as Timothy. No half measures were to be adopted towards <span class= "ital">these, </span>who tried to deceive their neighbours and possibly deceived themselves. The Pagan was to be courteously entreated, for in God's good time the glory of the Lord might shine, too, on those now sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death. The heretic, seduced by false men from the school of the Apostles, where the life as well as the doctrine of Jesus was taught, was to be gently instructed. Perhaps God would lead him once more home. But <span class= "ital">these, </span>who, while pretending to belong to Jesus, lived the degraded life of the heathen, were to be shunned. No communion, no friendly intercourse was possible between the hypocrite and the Christian.<p>The command here is so definite--"from these turn away"--that any theory which would relegate the vices just enumerated to a distant future would require, as above stated, that a strained and unnatural meaning should be given to this positive direction to Timothy. The plain and obvious signification of the passage is: men committing the sins alluded to lived <span class= "ital">then</span> in the Church over which Timothy presided; they were to be avoided by the chief presbyter and his brethren.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Holding</span> for <span class="accented">having</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hating denied</span> for <span class="accented">denyiny</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">these also</span> for <span class="accented">such</span>, A.V.
