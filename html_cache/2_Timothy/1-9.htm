Salvation is a divine act, not based on human merit, reflecting God's initiative in rescuing humanity from sin. The "holy calling" suggests a life set apart for God's purposes, echoing <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, which describes believers as a chosen people. The concept of holiness is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel was called to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This calling is not just individual but communal, involving the church as the body of Christ.<p><b>not because of our works</b><br>This phrase underscores the doctrine of grace, contrasting human effort with divine initiative. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> reinforces this by stating that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of works. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where human attempts to achieve righteousness fall short, as seen in the story of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The rejection of works-based salvation was a central theme in the Reformation, emphasizing faith alone (sola fide).<p><b>but by His own purpose</b><br>God's purpose is central to the biblical narrative, from creation to redemption. This purpose is often mysterious and beyond human understanding, as seen in <a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, where God's plans are described as unstoppable. The idea of divine purpose is also evident in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, where all things work together for good for those who love God. This purpose is not arbitrary but reflects God's character and ultimate plan for creation.<p><b>and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus</b><br>Grace is a foundational concept in Christian theology, representing unmerited favor. It is through Christ Jesus that this grace is made manifest, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies of a coming Messiah (Isaiah 53). The New Testament frequently highlights Jesus as the embodiment of grace, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where He is described as full of grace and truth. This grace is transformative, enabling believers to live in accordance with God's will.<p><b>before time began</b><br>This phrase points to the eternal nature of God's plan, suggesting that salvation and calling were part of God's design before creation. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, which states that God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. The concept of God's eternal plan is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His sovereignty and foreknowledge. It assures believers of the certainty and security of their salvation, rooted in God's timeless purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233;

This is an inclusive word, and comprehends all God's dealings with us in respect to our redemption. (See Notes on <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>.) Again, as so frequently in these Pastoral Epistles, is the First Person of the blessed Trinity referred to as the Saviour.<p><span class= "bld">Us.</span>--Paul and Timothy, and all who believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, are included under "us."<p><span class= "bld">And called us with an holy calling.</span>--This explains the means by which God was pleased to save St. Paul and Timothy. <span class= "ital">He</span> called them.

There is an inner as well as an outer calling; the "outer" comes through the preaching of the word, the inner by means of the voice of the Holy Ghost in the heart.<p><span class= "bld">Not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace.</span>--We are told in the next clause that "the grace" was given <span class= "ital">before the world began;</span> therefore "our works" could have had nothing to do with the divine purpose which was resolved on by God. As Chrysostom observes, "No one counselling with Him, but of His own purpose, the purpose originating in His own goodness." Calvin pithily remarks, "If God chose us before the creation of the world, He could not have considered the question of our works, which could have had no existence at a period when we ourselves were not." "But according to" (<span class= "ital">in pursuance of</span>) "His own purposes," with emphasis on "own"--that purpose which was prompted by nothing outward, but which arose solely out of the divine goodwill, or goodness, or love. (See <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>.)
