This phrase indicates divine authority and the execution of God's will. The king's command reflects the seriousness of the situation and the importance of obedience to God's instructions.<p><b>Tie him hand and foot</b><br>This phrase signifies complete restraint and the inability to act or escape. It symbolizes the finality of judgment and the totality of the sinner's helplessness. In biblical times, binding someone was a common practice for prisoners, indicating that the person is under judgment and has no freedom.<p><b>and throw him into the outer darkness</b><br>The "outer darkness" is a metaphor for separation from God, often interpreted as hell or eternal damnation. In Jewish culture, darkness was associated with chaos and evil, contrasting with the light of God's presence. This phrase emphasizes the severity of being cast away from God's kingdom and the consequences of rejecting His invitation.<p><b>where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth</b><br>This expression is frequently used in the New Testament to describe the anguish and regret of those who face eternal judgment. Weeping indicates sorrow and despair, while gnashing of teeth suggests anger and frustration. It underscores the reality of eternal punishment and the emotional torment of those who are excluded from God's presence.
