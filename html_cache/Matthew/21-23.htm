The temple courts were a hub of religious activity, where rabbis often taught their disciples. Jesus' presence here underscores His role as a teacher and His authority to interpret the Law. The temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, and Jesus' actions in this setting highlight His challenge to the existing religious order. His teaching in the temple courts also fulfills prophecies about the Messiah bringing new understanding and authority to God's Word.<p><b>the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him</b><br>The chief priests and elders were key religious leaders in Jewish society, responsible for maintaining temple worship and interpreting the Law. Their approach to Jesus signifies a confrontation between the established religious authority and Jesus' emerging authority. This encounter reflects the tension between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, who felt threatened by His growing influence and His challenges to their interpretations of the Law. The presence of both chief priests and elders indicates a united front from the religious establishment against Jesus.<p><b>&#8220;By what authority are You doing these things?&#8221; they asked</b><br>The question of authority is central to this passage. The religious leaders are questioning Jesus' right to teach and perform actions such as cleansing the temple, which He had done earlier. Authority in Jewish tradition was typically derived from lineage, training, or appointment by established leaders. Jesus' authority, however, comes directly from God, which the religious leaders fail to recognize. This question also reflects their inability to understand the divine nature of Jesus' mission and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<p><b>&#8220;And who gave You this authority?&#8221;</b><br>This follow-up question emphasizes the leaders' demand for a human source of Jesus' authority. In Jewish culture, authority was often passed down through recognized channels, such as rabbinical schools or priestly lineage. The leaders' question reveals their blindness to Jesus' divine authority and their focus on human credentials. This moment foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Jesus by the religious establishment, as they cannot accept His divine mission and identity as the Son of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching in the temple courts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer area of the temple in Jerusalem where teaching and discussions often took place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in charge of temple rituals and maintaining the temple's sanctity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_people.htm">Elders of the People</a></b><br>Respected leaders and decision-makers within the Jewish community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/authority_questioned.htm">Authority Questioned</a></b><br>The event where Jesus' authority is challenged by the religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority.htm">Understanding Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' authority comes from God, not human institutions.

The question implied that those who asked it knew that the Prophet of Nazareth had not been so admitted. The second question gave point to the first. Could He name the Rabbi who had trained Him, or authorised Him to teach?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23-ch. 22:14.</span> - <span class="accented">Our Lord's authority questioned</span>: <span class="accented">he replies by uttering three parables</span>. (<a href="/mark/11-27.htm">Mark 11:27-12:12</a>; <a href="/luke/20-1.htm">Luke 20:1-18</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-27.</span> - <span class="accented">First attack, referring to his late actions</span>: <span class="accented">and Christ's answer</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he was come into the temple</span>. The conversation recorded here belongs to the Tuesday of the Holy Week, and took place in the courts of the temple, at this time filled with pilgrims from all parts of the world, who hung upon Christ's words, and beheld his doings with wonder and awe. This sight roused to fury the envy and anger of the authorities, and they sent forth sections of their cleverest men to undermine his authority in the eyes of the people, or to force from him statements on which they might found criminal accusation against him. <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests and the elders of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> According to the other evangelists, there were also scribes, teachers of the Law, united with them in this deputation, which thus comprised all the elements of the Sanhedrin. This seems to have been the first time that the council took formal notice of Jesus' claims and actions, and demanded from him personally an account of himself. They had been quick enough in inquiring into the Baptist's credentials, when he suddenly appeared on the banks of Jordan (see <a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>, etc.); but they had studiously, till quite lately, avoided any regular investigation of the pretensions of Jesus. In the thee of late proceedings, this could no longer be delayed. A crisis had arrived; their own peculiar province was publicly invaded, and their authority attacked; the opponent must be withstood by the action of the constituted court. <span class="cmt_word">As he was teaching.</span> Jesus did not confine himself to beneficent acts; he used the opportunity of the gathering of crowds around him to preach unto them the gospel (<a href="/luke/20-1.htm">Luke 20:1</a>), to teach truths which came with double force from One who bad done such marvellous things. <span class="cmt_word">By what authority doest thou these things?</span> They refer to the triumphal entry, the reception of the homage offered, the healing of the blind and lame, the teaching as with the authority of a rabbi, and especially to the cleansing of the temple. No one could presume to teach without a proper commission: where was his authorization? They were the guardians and rulers of the temple: what right had he to interfere with their management, and to use the sacred precincts for his own purposes? These and such like questions were in their mind when they addressed him thus. Wilfully ignoring the many proofs they had of Christ's Divine mission (which one of them, Nicodemus, had long before been constrained to own, <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), they raised the question now as a novel and unanswered one. <span class="cmt_word">Who gave thee this authority?</span> They resolve the general inquiry into the personal one - Who was it that conferred upon you this authority which you presume to exercise? Was it some earthly ruler, or was it God himself? Perhaps they mean to insinuate that Satan was the master whose power he wielded - an accusation already often made. They thought thus to place Christ in an embarrassing position, from which he could not emerge without affording the opportunity which they desired. The trap was cleverly set, and, as they deemed, unavoidable. If he was forced to confess that he spoke and acted without any proper authorization, he would be humiliated in the eyes of the people, and might be officially silenced by the strong hand. If he asserted himself to be the Messiah and the bearer of a Divine commission, they would at once bring against him a charge of blasphemy (<a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
