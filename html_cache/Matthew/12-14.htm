Their departure signifies a deliberate move away from Jesus, both physically and spiritually. This action follows a confrontation with Jesus, highlighting their growing opposition to His teachings and authority. The Pharisees' role as religious leaders made their rejection of Jesus significant, as they were influential in shaping public opinion.<p><b>and plotted</b><br>The term "plotted" indicates a premeditated and secretive plan. This reflects the depth of their hostility and the seriousness of their intentions. The Pharisees' plotting is a fulfillment of the growing tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, as seen throughout the Gospels. Their actions are not spontaneous but calculated, showing their determination to eliminate what they perceived as a threat to their power and religious system.<p><b>how they might kill Jesus.</b><br>The intent to kill Jesus marks a pivotal moment in the Gospel narrative, foreshadowing His eventual crucifixion. This desire to kill is rooted in their perception of Jesus as a blasphemer and a disruptor of their authority. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the suffering Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The Pharisees' plot aligns with the broader theme of Jesus' rejection by His own people, as prophesied in scriptures like <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>. This phrase underscores the gravity of the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders, setting the stage for the events leading to His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Their plot, though wicked, fulfills prophecy and moves God&#8217;s salvation plan forward. The verse warns against religious pride that blinds, while affirming the sovereignty of God who turns human evil into the means of mankind&#8217;s redemption through Christ&#8217;s cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Held a council against him.</span>--If, as seems probable, these Pharisees included those who had come from Jerusalem, the deliberation was of more importance in its bearing on our Lord's future work than if it had been a mere meeting of the local members of the party. It is significant that St. Mark adds (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>) that they called the Herodians into their counsels. These latter have not yet been mentioned in the Gospel history, but they had probably been irritated by the marked reference to them and their habits of life in the contrast which our Lord drew between them and the Baptist.
