His secretive meeting with the Magi reflects his cunning nature and desire to control the situation. The Magi, likely astrologers or wise men from the East, were seen as important figures, and Herod's decision to meet them privately suggests his intent to manipulate the information they possessed. This secrecy indicates Herod's fear of losing power, as he was aware of the Jewish prophecies regarding a new king. The Magi's journey, possibly from Persia or Babylon, highlights the widespread anticipation of a messianic figure.<p><b>and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.</b><br>The star's appearance is a significant event, often linked to the prophecy in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, which speaks of a star coming out of Jacob. Herod's inquiry about the timing suggests his intent to calculate the age of the child he perceived as a threat. This aligns with his later decree to kill all male children in Bethlehem two years old and under, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>. The star's role in guiding the Magi underscores the divine orchestration of events surrounding Jesus' birth.

Secrecy was doubly necessary. He would not publicly commit himself to acknowledging the rights of the new King, and he would give no opportunity for others to warn the Child's parents of the dangerous interest that Herod was taking in him. Duplicity was very characteristic of Herod; cf. his assassination of Aristobulus the high priest (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 15:03. 3), and his alluring his son Antipater home to death (ibid., 17:5. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Inquired of them diligently</span>; <span class="accented">learned of them carefully</span> (Revised Version); "lerned of hem bisili" (Wickliffe); <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The stress is not upon Herod's careful questioning, but on the exact information that he obtained. <span class="cmt_word">What time the star appeared</span>. Although this is not the literal translation, it may, perhaps, represent the sense of the original ( <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the participle characterizing the star in its most important relation - its appearance, and the words being treated as a compound expression (cf. <a href="/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9, 12</a>). Herod supposed that the birth of the Babe was synchronous with the first appearance of the star. The translation, however, of the Revised Version margin, "the time of the star that appeared," better suits the exact wording ( <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>;<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) , the phrase thus including both the first appearance and also the period of continuance (cf. Grotius, "non initium, sed continuitas"). But it is difficult to see What Herod would have learned from this latter particular. Some even think that the star was still visible (Plumptre; Weiss, 'Matthew'), but in this case the joy of the Magi in ver. 10 is not satisfactorily explained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
