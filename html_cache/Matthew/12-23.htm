In the context of first-century Judea, where many were familiar with the prophecies of a coming Messiah, Jesus' actions were unprecedented. The term "astounded" suggests a deep sense of amazement and wonder, indicating that what they witnessed was beyond ordinary human capability. This reaction is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus' miracles elicited similar responses (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>, <a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>). The crowds' astonishment also reflects the growing tension between Jesus' rising popularity and the skepticism of the religious leaders.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Could this be the Son of David?&#8221;</b><br>The title "Son of David" is a messianic term rooted in the Old Testament, particularly in the promises made to King David that his lineage would produce a ruler whose kingdom would be everlasting (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). By asking if Jesus could be the "Son of David," the crowd is questioning whether He is the long-awaited Messiah. This reflects the Jewish expectation of a deliverer who would restore Israel's fortunes and establish God's kingdom. The question posed by the crowd indicates a recognition of Jesus' potential messianic identity, which is a central theme in the Gospel of Matthew. This title is significant because it connects Jesus to the Davidic covenant and the fulfillment of prophecy, such as <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1-10</a>, which speaks of a shoot from the stump of Jesse (David's father) who will bring justice and peace. The crowd's question also sets the stage for the ensuing conflict with the Pharisees, who challenge Jesus' authority and seek to discredit Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>A group of people witnessing Jesus' miracles and teachings.

The severity of the condition magnifies the miracle.<p>- This awe signals that something beyond ordinary prophetic activity is occurring, hinting at divine authority similar to the reaction in <a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>, where &#8220;they were all struck with astonishment and glorified God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked</b><p>- The crowd&#8217;s verbal response shows they are processing evidence, not mindlessly impressed (<a href="/john/7-31.htm">John 7:31</a>).<p>- Scripture often records people asking about Jesus&#8217; identity following a sign (<a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>; <a href="/john/10-24.htm">John 10:24</a>).
