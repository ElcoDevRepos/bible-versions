The centurion's presence highlights the Roman occupation of Judea and the diverse social interactions during Jesus' ministry. The centurion's approach to Jesus demonstrates humility and faith, as he seeks healing for his servant, breaking cultural barriers between Jews and Gentiles. This interaction foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius, another centurion.<p><b>&#8220;Go!</b><br>Jesus' command to "Go!" signifies His authority and the immediacy of His response. Unlike typical healing practices of the time, which often involved physical presence or rituals, Jesus' word alone is sufficient. This reflects the power of God's word in creation (Genesis 1) and the authority of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>As you have believed,</b><br>The centurion's faith is central to this narrative. His belief in Jesus' authority over illness, even from a distance, exemplifies true faith. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that faith is a key component in receiving God's promises, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>. The centurion's faith contrasts with the often skeptical or unbelieving attitudes of others, including some of Jesus' own disciples.<p><b>so will it be done for you.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the relationship between faith and divine action. Jesus' assurance that the centurion's request will be fulfilled as he believed emphasizes the power of faith in God's promises. It echoes the principle found in <a href="/mark/11-24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>, where belief in prayer is linked to receiving what is asked for. This also prefigures the faith required for salvation, as articulated in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>And his servant was healed at that very hour.</b><br>The immediate healing of the centurion's servant demonstrates Jesus' divine authority over sickness and His compassion for all people, regardless of social status or ethnicity. This miracle serves as a testament to Jesus' identity as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which speak of the Messiah bearing our infirmities. The phrase "at that very hour" emphasizes the miraculous nature of the healing, confirming the centurion's faith and Jesus' power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs the miracle of healing the centurion's servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_centurion.htm">The Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer who demonstrates great faith in Jesus' authority and power, despite being a Gentile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>The centurion's servant who is healed by Jesus' word, illustrating the power of faith and Jesus' authority over illness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The town where this event takes place, often serving as a backdrop for Jesus' ministry and miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing.htm">The Healing</a></b><br>The miraculous event where the servant is healed at the exact moment Jesus declares it, showcasing Jesus' divine power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_authority.htm">Faith and Authority</a></b><br>The centurion's understanding of authority and his faith in Jesus' word serve as a model for believers.
