Jerusalem is not only the geographical destination but also the prophetic fulfillment of Jesus' mission. The city is where the temple is located, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This journey is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speak of the suffering servant. The phrase "going up" is literal, as Jerusalem is situated on a hill, but it also signifies the spiritual ascent towards the culmination of Jesus' earthly ministry.<p><b>and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes.</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term that Jesus frequently uses for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and an everlasting kingdom. This phrase indicates the beginning of Jesus' passion, where He will be handed over to the religious authorities. The chief priests and scribes represent the Jewish leadership, who are responsible for maintaining religious law and order. This handing over is a fulfillment of the divine plan, as foretold in scriptures like <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe the suffering and rejection of the Messiah.<p><b>They will condemn Him to death</b><br>This phrase highlights the legal and religious proceedings that will lead to Jesus' crucifixion. The condemnation by the Jewish leaders fulfills the prophecies of a suffering Messiah, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being "cut off from the land of the living." The act of condemnation by the religious authorities underscores the rejection of Jesus by His own people, as prophesied in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>. This legal condemnation is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for the Roman involvement in Jesus' execution, as the Jewish leaders lacked the authority to carry out a death sentence under Roman rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Son of Man)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," a title that emphasizes both His humanity and His messianic role, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where significant events in Jesus' life and ministry occur, including His crucifixion and resurrection.
