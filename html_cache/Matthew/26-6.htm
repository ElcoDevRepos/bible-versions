It is significant in the Gospels as a place where Jesus often visited, especially during the final week of His life. Bethany was the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11). This village served as a place of refuge and rest for Jesus, away from the tensions in Jerusalem. The proximity to Jerusalem made it a strategic location for Jesus' ministry during the Passover.<p><b>in the home of Simon the Leper</b><br>Simon the Leper is mentioned only in this context, and little is known about him outside of this passage. The designation "the Leper" suggests that he was once afflicted with leprosy, a condition that would have made him an outcast according to Jewish law (Leviticus 13-14). It is likely that Simon had been healed, possibly by Jesus, allowing him to host guests in his home. This setting highlights Jesus' compassion and willingness to associate with those marginalized by society. The gathering in Simon's home sets the stage for the anointing of Jesus, an act of devotion and foreshadowing of His impending death and burial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is in Bethany at this time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A village near Jerusalem, known as the place where Jesus often stayed and performed miracles, such as raising Lazarus from the dead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_leper.htm">Simon the Leper</a></b><br>A man who had been afflicted with leprosy, indicating that Jesus was willing to associate with those considered unclean by society.

It became Jesus&#8217; &#8220;base&#8221; each evening during His final week (<a href="/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>; <a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;while Jesus was&#8221; roots the scene in real time and space. This is not a parable or vision but an historical moment, the same Bethany where He had raised Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1, 43</a>-44) and shared a final meal with that family six days before Passover (<a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Bethany provided a calm refuge before the coming storm of the cross, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>, that the Servant would &#8220;set His face like flint&#8221; toward the task ahead. Time in Bethany shows the Father&#8217;s provision of refreshment even as the hour of suffering approached.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the home</b><p>&#8226; Jesus regularly accepted invitations into ordinary houses, turning private spaces into platforms for grace and teaching&#8212;Zacchaeus&#8217; home (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5-10</a>), Levi&#8217;s table (<a href="/mark/2-15.htm">Mark 2:15-17</a>), Martha&#8217;s living room (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Home&#8221; highlights fellowship. He did not keep a polite distance from people&#8217;s daily lives; He sat at their tables, reclined on their couches, shared their bread. Such closeness anticipates <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>: &#8220;If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me&#8221;.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/bsb/matthew/26.htm">Matthew 26</a> the house becomes the stage for extravagant worship when a woman pours costly perfume on Jesus&#8217; head (<a href="/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>). God often selects humble settings&#8212;an upper room, a borrowed colt, a garden tomb&#8212;to display His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Simon the Leper</b><p>&#8226; Scripture never records Simon&#8217;s healing, yet his nickname signals that he once bore the dreaded disease (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13&#8211;14</a>). Since active lepers lived in isolation, Simon&#8217;s ability to host a meal implies Jesus had already cleansed him, much as He did the unnamed man in <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-3</a>.<p>&#8226; The lingering title &#8220;the Leper&#8221; testifies to Christ&#8217;s power. Every time Simon&#8217;s name was spoken, people remembered what he used to be and Who changed him&#8212;echoing <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; willingness to eat with a man formerly marked as unclean illustrates the heart of the gospel: He welcomes those society pushes away. When the coming anointing prepares Him for burial, it happens in a place once defiled, now sanctified by His presence, previewing how the cross will cleanse sinners &#8220;to the uttermost&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a> anchors the anointing story in three earthy details&#8212;Bethany, a home, and a former leper. Together they reveal a Savior who moves purposefully toward the cross, seeks intimate fellowship with ordinary people, and transforms outcasts into hosts of His glory. The verse reminds believers that Jesus still meets us where we live, turns our past scars into testimonies, and invites us to honor Him with wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Now when Jesus was in Bethany.</span>--The narrative is given out of its proper order on account of its connection (as indicated in St. John's record) with the act of the Traitor. St. John fixes it (<a href="/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>) at six days before the Passover, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> on the evening that preceded the entry into Jerusalem. It was, therefore, a feast such as Jews were wont to hold at the close of the Sabbath.<p><span class= "bld">In the house of Simon the leper.</span>--Of the man so described we know nothing beyond the fact thus mentioned. It is not likely, had he been a leper at the time, that men would have gathered to a feast at his house, and it is natural to infer that our Lord had healed him, but that the name still adhered to him to distinguish him from other Simons. We learn from St. John (<a href="/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>) that Lazarus was there, and that Martha, true to her character, was busy "serving." The Twelve were also there, and probably many others. The incident that follows is narrated by all the Evangelists except St. Luke, who may either not have heard it from his informants, or, if he had heard it, may have passed it over as having already recorded a fact of like character (<a href="/context/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37-40</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The anointing at Bethany.</span> (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3-9</a>; <a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1-8</a>.) This parenthetical episode is introduced by the two synoptists out of its chronological order, with the view of indicating the immediate cause of Judas's resolution to betray his Master, the issue of which they proceed to narrate (see on ver. 14). This anointing must not be confounded with that related by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, etc.), where the scene, the time, and the actor were different, and the significance was of a very inferior nature. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus was in Bethany.</span> St. John tells us that the incident took place six days before the Passover, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the Saturday preceding Palm Sunday. It is St. Matthew's custom to describe events not always in their historical sequence, but according to some logical or spiritual connection which in his mind overrides considerations of time or place. (For Bethany, see on Matthew 21:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Simon the leper</span>. Not that he was a leper now, but either the appellation was hereditary, in reference to some such malady inflicted on his family, or he himself, having been cured by Christ, retained the name in memory of his cleansing. So St. Matthew is called "the publican" after he had relinquished his obnoxious business (<a href="/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>), and the revived man is termed "the dead" (<a href="/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a>). The frequency of the name Simon among the Jews rendered the addition of a surname expedient; thus we have Simon the Cananite, Simon the tanner, Simon Bar-john, etc. Nothing certain is known about this person. Tradition makes him father of Lazarus or husband of Martha. That he was connected with the holy family of Bethany, either by relationship or close friendship, seems to be well established. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(genomenou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
