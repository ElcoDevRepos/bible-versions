In the biblical context, this refers to the people who were living their daily lives without heeding Noah's warnings about the impending flood. This ignorance is often seen as a result of spiritual blindness and a focus on worldly matters rather than spiritual truths. The cultural context of Noah's time was one of moral decay and corruption, as described in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.<p><b>until the flood came</b><br>The flood is a historical event recorded in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>, where God judged the earth due to its wickedness. Archaeological evidence, such as flood narratives from various ancient cultures, supports the occurrence of a significant flood event. The flood serves as a type of divine judgment, prefiguring future judgments. It also symbolizes baptism, as noted in <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>, where the floodwaters represent a cleansing and a new beginning.<p><b>and swept them all away</b><br>This phrase indicates the totality and suddenness of the judgment. The floodwaters came unexpectedly and with great force, leaving no opportunity for escape. This serves as a warning about the finality of God's judgment and the importance of being spiritually prepared. The cultural context of ancient Near Eastern societies often included sudden natural disasters, which were seen as acts of divine intervention.<p><b>So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man</b><br>The "coming of the Son of Man" refers to the second coming of Jesus Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. This phrase draws a parallel between the days of Noah and the end times, emphasizing the unexpected nature of Christ's return. The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term used by Jesus, rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a divine figure who will establish an everlasting kingdom. This connection underscores the fulfillment of prophecy and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_noah's_time.htm">The People of Noah's Time</a></b><br>These individuals lived during the time of Noah and were unaware of the impending flood despite Noah's warnings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.

The Lord assures us that similar recklessness and unbelief will be found at his coming. Doubtless anguish and fear will fill many hearts, but the general feeling will be incredulity, and a false security which refuses to take warning. Sadler compares it to Belshazzar's feast at the very moment of danger, and the Athenians' insensibility at the time of the great plague, when the people seemed to be exemplifying the maxim, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die" (<a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>). "For like as when the ark was making, they believed not; but while it was set in the midst of them, proclaiming beforehand the evils that are to come, they, when they saw it, lived in pleasure... so also now, antichrist, indeed, shall appear, after whom is the end, and the punishments at the end, and vengeance intolerable; but they that are held by the intoxication of wickedness [comp. Wisd. 4:12] shall not so much as perceive the dreadful nature of the things that are on the point of being done. Wherefore also Paul saith, 'as travail upon a woman with child' [<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>], even so shall those fearful and incurable evils come upon them" (Chrysostom, 'Hom.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Morisen considers that Christ is not blaming the antediluvians, but simply referring to the fact that up to the last moment they were ignorant of the impending catastrophe.
