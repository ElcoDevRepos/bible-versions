The term "woe" is a strong expression of judgment and lament. The scribes and Pharisees were respected for their knowledge of the law, yet Jesus calls them "hypocrites," indicating a discrepancy between their outward appearance and inner reality. This echoes the prophetic tradition of calling out Israel's leaders for failing to lead the people in true righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>You pay tithes of mint, dill, and cumin.</b><br>These herbs were small and of little monetary value, yet the Pharisees meticulously tithed them, demonstrating their focus on minor details of the law. Tithing was a commandment in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>), but the Pharisees' emphasis on these small items highlights their legalistic approach. This practice reflects a broader cultural context where religious leaders were known for their strict adherence to the law, often at the expense of its spirit.<p><b>But you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness.</b><br>Jesus contrasts the Pharisees' focus on minor tithes with their neglect of more significant ethical demands. "Justice, mercy, and faithfulness" are central themes in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which emphasizes doing justice, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God. These are foundational aspects of God's character and His expectations for His people, reflecting the heart of the law.<p><b>You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.</b><br>Jesus affirms that while the Pharisees' attention to detail in tithing is not wrong, it should not come at the expense of more important moral obligations. This statement underscores the comprehensive nature of obedience to God, which includes both the letter and the spirit of the law. It aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>, where He emphasizes fulfilling the law's true intent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish scholars and teachers of the Law who were responsible for copying and interpreting the Scriptures.

The Lord is heart-broken over leaders who claim spiritual authority yet live in contradiction to God&#8217;s heart. Isaiah had already exposed this disconnect: &#8220;These people draw near with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). By calling them &#8220;hypocrites,&#8221; Jesus unmasks the pretense&#8212;like whitewashed tombs described later in the chapter (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). It is a sober reminder for every believer: outward reputation never substitutes for inward reality (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You pay tithes of mint, dill, and cumin</b><p>The Pharisees&#8217; diligence in tithing even the tiniest garden herbs reveals how exacting they were about the minutiae of the Law. Tithing itself was commanded (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-23</a>), and Jesus does not criticize the act. The problem is proportion. When obedience becomes a checklist instead of an expression of love for God, the smallest tasks can feel hugely important while bigger responsibilities fade. Luke&#8217;s parallel account echoes the scene: &#8220;Woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, yet you neglect justice and the love of God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-42.htm">Luke 11:42</a>).<p>Consider how this might look today:<p>&#8226; Focusing on perfect attendance, yet ignoring people who are hurting in the pew behind us.<p>&#8226; Debating theological fine points, yet harboring resentment toward a neighbor.<p>Details matter, but never at the expense of devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness</b><p>God&#8217;s Law carries a hierarchy of importance. Some commands reveal His moral character more plainly. Here Jesus highlights three:<p>&#8226; Justice &#8211; treating others with fair, righteous equity (<a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9-10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Mercy &#8211; active compassion that lifts the broken (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>; 12:7).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness &#8211; steadfast loyalty to God and people (<a href="/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>).<p>Micah had summarized the same priorities centuries earlier: &#8220;He has shown you, O man, what is good and what does the LORD require of you but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). Whenever outward ritual overshadows these core virtues, hypocrisy is near.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former</b><p>Jesus refuses a false choice. Detailed obedience and heartfelt righteousness belong together.<p>&#8226; He came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in small things demonstrates reliability for greater ones (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Love gives meaning to every act of service (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>).<p>The call is whole-life integrity: honor God in both the decimals and the dollars, the garden herbs and the heavy matters of justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a> exposes the danger of substituting meticulous religious performance for genuine, God-shaped character. Jesus condemns leaders who scrupulously tithe minuscule herbs yet ignore justice, mercy, and faithfulness. He affirms that detailed obedience is good, but only when joined to the greater commandments that reflect God&#8217;s heart. True disciples keep both: they refuse to neglect the &#8220;weightier&#8221; issues while still honoring the smaller ones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin.</span>--The language of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-17.htm" title="You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:">Deuteronomy 12:17</a> seems to recognise only corn, wine, and oil, among the produce of the earth, as subject to the law of tithes. The Pharisee, in his minute scrupulosity (based, it may be, on the more general language of <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm" title="And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:30</a>), made a point of gathering the tenth sprig of every garden herb, and presenting it to the priest. So far as this was done at the bidding of an imperfectly illumined conscience our Lord does not blame it. It was not, like the teaching as to oaths and the Corban, a direct perversion of the Law. What He did censure was the substitution of the lower for the higher. With the three examples of the "infinitely little" He contrasts the three ethical obligations that were infinitely great, "judgment, mercy, and faith." The word translated "mint" means literally the "sweet-smelling," the "fragrant."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Fifth woe</span> - against scrupulosity in trifles and neglect of weighty duties (<a href="/luke/11-42.htm">Luke 11:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye pay tithe of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">ye tithe</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mint and anise and cummin.</span> Practically, the law of tithe was enforced only in the case of the produce mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a> - corn, wine, and oil - but the Pharisees, in their overstrained scrupulosity, applied the law of <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a> ("all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's") to the smallest pot herbs, even to their leaves and stalks. "Mint" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Of this well known plant several species grow in Palestine; it was one of the ingredients of the sauce of bitter herbs eaten at the Paschal feast (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>), and was hung up in the synagogue for its fragrance. "Anise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is known to us as "dill," and is much used in medicine and for seasoning. "Cummin" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) (<a href="/isaiah/28-25.htm">Isaiah 28:25, 27</a>), an umbelliferous plant, with seeds something like caraways, and used, like them, as a condiment and medicine. <span class="cmt_word">Have emitted the weightier matters of the Law.</span> The Pharisees were very far from treating important duties with the same scrupulosity which they observed in little matters. Christ particularizes these weighty duties: <span class="cmt_word">Judgment,</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>mercy, and faith.</span> Three are named, in contrast to the three petty observances mentioned above. Christ seems to refer to the words of <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (see also <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9, 10</a>). Worthless are all outward observances when the moral precepts are neglected. "Judgment" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means acting equitably to one's neighbour, hurting nobody by word or deed; as in <a href="/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a> a man is sought "that exerciseth justice.'" Such impartiality is specially enjoined in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, etc.). "Mercy," loving kindness in conduct, often taught in the Pentateuch, as in the case of the widow, the stranger, and the debtor, and very different from the feeling of those who "devour widows' houses." "Faith" may mean fidelity to promises: "He that sweareth unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance" (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>); but it is more probably taken as that belief in God without which it is not possible to please him, and which should underlie and influence all moral action (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)... <span class="cmt_word">the other</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). "These last" are judgment, mercy, and faith; these it was your duty to have done. "The other" refers to the tithing mentioned above. Christ does not censure this attention to minutiae. He would teach conformity to regulations made by competent authority, or conscientiously felt to be binding, even though not distinctly enjoined in Scripture (see vers. 2, 3); his blame is reserved for that expenditure of zeal on trifles which stood in the place of, or left no strength for, higher duties. It was a very elastic conscience which tithed a pot herb and neglected judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Strain at a gnat;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. "At" is supposed to be a misprint for "out." Thus Revised Version, and early English versions, <span class="accented">which strain out the gnat</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">excolantes culicem.</span> Alford thinks the present reading was an intentional alteration, meaning "strain (out the wine) at (the occurrence of) a gnat" - which seems more ingenious than probable. If "at" be retained, it must be taken as expressive of the fastidiousness which had to make a strong effort to overcome its distaste at this little insect. The wine, before drinking, was carefully strained through linen (see <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, "strained wine," Septuagint) to avoid the accidental violation of <a href="/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20, 23</a>, etc.; Leviticus 17:10-14, by swallowing an unclean insect. The practice, which was in some sense a religious act, is found among the Buddhists in Hindostan and Ceylon, either to avoid pollution or to obviate the danger of taking life, which their code forbids. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>camel</span>. The gnat and the camel, which were alike unclean, stand at the extremities of the scale of comparative size. Our Lord uses a proverbial expression to denote the inconsistency which would avoid the smallest ceremonial defilement, but would take no account of the gravest moral pollution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
