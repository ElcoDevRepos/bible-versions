The context is the aftermath of their inability to cast out a demon from a boy, as described earlier in the chapter. The disciples approach Jesus privately, suggesting a sense of humility and a desire for understanding. This private setting indicates a close relationship between Jesus and His disciples, where they feel comfortable seeking guidance. It reflects the rabbinic tradition where disciples would often seek private instruction from their teacher. This moment underscores the importance of personal discipleship and the need for believers to seek deeper understanding from Christ.<p><b>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we drive it out?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' question reveals their confusion and concern over their failure. Previously, in <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>, Jesus had given them authority over unclean spirits, which makes their inability here perplexing to them. This question highlights a moment of self-examination and a desire to understand the spiritual dynamics at play. It points to the necessity of faith and reliance on God&#8217;s power rather than their own abilities. This incident serves as a teaching moment about the nature of faith and the importance of prayer and fasting, as Jesus explains in the following verses. It also foreshadows the greater spiritual battles the disciples will face and the need for complete dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who teaches and guides His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from Him and attempting to perform miracles in His name.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demon-possessed_boy.htm">The Demon-Possessed Boy</a></b><br>The subject of the miracle that the disciples were unable to perform, leading to their question.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father_of_the_boy.htm">The Father of the Boy</a></b><br>The one who brought his son to Jesus after the disciples failed to heal him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_private_setting.htm">The Private Setting</a></b><br>The disciples approach Jesus privately, indicating a moment of intimate teaching and reflection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_authority.htm">Faith and Authority</a></b><br>Jesus had already given the disciples authority over demons, but their lack of faith hindered their ability to exercise it.

The Lord's rebuke (ver. 17) had passed over their heads, and not been understood as applicable to themselves. So it was with some bitterness that they asked the question. The nine had not been permitted to witness the Transfiguration; they were not even to be made acquainted with this wondrous transaction at present. More preparation, greater receptivity, was required, before they were fit to be admitted to the full mysteries of the kingdom. They had still much to learn, were still only pupils, and their late failure was permitted in order to help them to attain to self-knowledge and more entire self-surrender. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Afterward</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
