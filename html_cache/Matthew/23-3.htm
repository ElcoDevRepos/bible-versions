The instruction to "practice and observe" highlights the importance of adhering to the Law as it was given by God through Moses. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the Law as central to their covenant relationship with God. The emphasis here is on the legitimacy of the Law itself, not necessarily the behavior of those who teach it. This aligns with passages such as <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, which calls for careful observance of God's commands.<p><b>But do not do what they do,</b><br>Here, Jesus warns against the hypocrisy of the religious leaders. While they teach the Law, their actions do not align with their words. This criticism is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>) condemned the people for honoring God with their lips while their hearts were far from Him. The cultural context of first-century Judaism placed a high value on outward religious observance, but Jesus calls for integrity and authenticity in one's faith practice.<p><b>for they do not practice what they preach.</b><br>This phrase underscores the disconnect between the leaders' teachings and their personal conduct. The call for congruence between words and actions is a recurring biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not hearers only. The failure of the religious leaders to live out their teachings serves as a warning against superficial religiosity and highlights the need for genuine righteousness. Jesus, as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, embodies the perfect example of practicing what one preaches, serving as the ultimate model for His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the crowds and His disciples about the behavior of the Pharisees and teachers of the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses and additional oral traditions.

That which was wanting was the life, without which even the highest maxims of morality became but the common-places of rhetorical declamation.

All that they taught or commanded out of the Law, or in due accordance therewith, was to be observed and obeyed. The statement is made in general terms, but was conditional and restricted by other considerations. It was only their official injunctions, derived immediately from Scripture, not their glosses, evasions, and interpretations, that were to be regarded with respect. The Lord had already taken occasion to warn against these errors (see <a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6, 11, 12</a>, etc.). As inheritors of the authority of Moses, and speaking <span class="accented">ex cathedra</span>, they were so far worthy of respect. This principle laid down, Christ proceeds to denounce their evil practices. <span class="cmt_word">After their works.</span> You must distinguish between their preaching and their practice; the latter is to be shunned with all care. The scribes are never accused of corrupting the sacred text, which, indeed, was scrupulously guarded, and kept pure and unaltered. It was their treatment of the doctrines thereof that was censured. Our Lord shows their evil example in two particulars - their principle was "words, not deeds" (ver. 4), and ostentation in religion (vers. 5-7). <span class="cmt_word">They say, and do not.</span> They enunciated the Law, they enjoined obedience to it in the minutest particulars, and yet they themselves continually, in the most important points (ver. 23), infringed, neglected, evaded it.
