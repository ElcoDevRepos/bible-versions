Although the prophecy is attributed to Jeremiah, the specific wording aligns more closely with <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>. This discrepancy may be due to the Jewish tradition of attributing a collection of prophetic writings to a major prophet like Jeremiah. The emphasis here is on the divine orchestration of events, showing that Jesus' betrayal was part of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>&#8220;They took the thirty pieces of silver,</b><br>The thirty pieces of silver refer to the amount Judas Iscariot received for betraying Jesus, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>. This sum is significant because it was the price of a slave according to <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>, highlighting the contempt and undervaluation of Jesus by those who rejected Him. The use of silver, a common currency for transactions, underscores the materialistic motivations behind Judas' betrayal.<p><b>the price set on Him by the people of Israel,</b><br>This phrase indicates that the betrayal and valuation of Jesus were not just the actions of Judas but were representative of the broader rejection by the people of Israel. The religious leaders, representing the nation, conspired to hand Jesus over to the Romans. This reflects the tragic fulfillment of the rejection of the Messiah by His own people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>.

And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.">Zechariah 11:13</a>, and there is no trace of their ever having occupied any other place in the Hebrew Canon. How is this discrepancy to be explained? (<span class= "ital">a</span>) Are we to assume an early error in transcription? Against this, there is the fact that MSS. and versions, with one or two exceptions, in which the correction is obviously of later date, give Jeremiah and not Zechariah. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) May we fall back upon the Jewish notion that the spirit of Jeremiah had passed into Zechariah; or that Jeremiah, having, at one time, stood first in the Jewish order of the Prophets, was taken as representing the whole volume, as David was of the whole Book of Psalms? This is possible, but it hardly falls within the limits of Probability that the writer of the Gospel would deliberately have thus given his quotation in a form sure to cause perplexity. (c) May we believe that the writer quoted from memory, and that recollecting the two conspicuous chapters (18 and 19) in which Jeremiah had spoken of the potter and his work, he was led to think that this also belonged to the same group of prophecies? I am free to confess that the last hypothesis seems to me the most natural and free from difficulty, unless it be the difficulty which is created by an arbitrary hypothesis as to the necessity of literal accuracy in an inspired writing. (2) There is the fact that the words given by St. Matthew neither represent the Greek version of <a href="/zechariah/11-13.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.">Zechariah 11:13</a>, nor the original Hebrew, but have the look of being a free quotation from memory adapted to the facts; and this, so far as it goes, is in favour of the last hypothesis. (3) It is hardly necessary to dwell on the fact that the words as they stand in Zechariah have an adequate historical meaning entirely independent of St. Matthew's application of them. This, as we have seen again and again (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm" title="Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/2-15.htm" title="And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.">Matthew 2:15-18</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>), was entirely compatible with the Evangelist's manner of dealing with prophecy. It was enough for him that the old words fitted into the facts, without asking, as we ask, whether they were originally meant to point to them. The combination in one verse, as he remembered it, of the thirty pieces of silver and the potter's field, was a coincidence that he could not pass over. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Spoken by Jeremy the prophet.</span> The prophecy, which St. Matthew says was fulfilled by the use made of Judas's pieces of silver, is found, not in Jeremiah, as we now possess his text, but, with some variations, in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12, 13</a>. It must be noted, however, that, though the passage in Zechariah has many remarkable affinities to the quotation in our evangelist's history, it is not. identical with it. In the prophet's vision there is no mention of the field, and the money is to be "cast to the potter in the house of the Lord." The Septuagint Version gives a very different reading, "Lay them in the foundry [or, 'furnace'], and I will see if it is approved, as I was approved for their sakes." And the last part of our quotation is hardly a representation of the Hebrew, "Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prised at of them." In the face of these discrepancies, it is supposed by many that St. Matthew had in his mind some utterance of Jeremiah not now extant; but if, as most expositors affirm, he was citing, more or less accurately, the words of Zechariah, we have to account for their being attributed to a wrong author. Of this difficulty, as it is considered, many solutions are offered. For instance: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The evangelist added no name to "the prophet;" and a scribe, hazily remembering the transaction in <a href="/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6</a>, etc., interpolated the word "Jeremiah." It is true that the Syriac omits "Jeremiah," but all other versions, and nearly all the Greek manuscripts, insert it; so there can be no reasonable doubt that it existed in the original text. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The two words written abbreviated thus, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, might be easily mistaken. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The evangelist fell into error, by oversight or lapse of memory, as is supposed to be the ease in <a href="/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a> and <a href="/acts/7-4.htm">Acts 7:4, 16</a>.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
