The disciples, who had been with Jesus throughout His ministry, witnessed many miracles and teachings, yet they often struggled to understand the deeper spiritual significance of events.<p><b>they were indignant</b><br>The disciples' indignation reflects a common human reaction to perceived extravagance, especially when resources could be used for practical purposes. This reaction highlights their misunderstanding of the spiritual importance of the woman's act. The term "indignant" suggests a strong emotional response, indicating that the disciples were genuinely upset by what they saw as a misuse of resources.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Why this waste?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the disciples reveals their practical mindset, as they viewed the anointing as a waste of valuable resources. This perspective contrasts with Jesus' understanding of the act as a preparation for His burial. The disciples' question also reflects a broader theme in the Gospels, where Jesus often challenges societal norms and values, emphasizing spiritual truths over material concerns. This moment can be connected to other instances where Jesus teaches about the value of devotion and sacrifice, such as the widow's offering in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were present during the anointing at Bethany.

The verse invites readers to examine whether they, too, ever label wholehearted devotion to Christ as excessive, and it underscores that in God&#8217;s economy, nothing poured out for His glory is ever wasted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">When his disciples saw it.</span>--There is a singular narrowing of the limits in the three narratives. St. Mark reports that "some had indignation;" St. John (<a href="/john/12-4.htm" title="Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,">John 12:4</a>), as knowing who had whispered the first word of blame, fixes the uncharitable judgment on "Judas Iscariot, Simon's son." The narrow, covetous soul of the Traitor could see nothing in the lavish gift but a "waste" (literally, <span class= "ital">perdition</span>) that was matter for reproach. There is something almost terribly suggestive in the fact that our Lord repeats the self-same word when He describes Judas as a "son of perdition" (<a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>). He had wasted that which was more precious than the ointment of spikenard. He wondered that his Master should accept such an offering. His indignation, partly real, partly affected, was perhaps honestly shared by some of his fellow-disciples, probably by those of the third group, with whom he came most into contact, and of whom we may well think as having a less glowing love, and narrower sympathies than the others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When his disciples saw it.</span> St. John states that the objection came originally from Judas. Doubtless, when it was once made, many concurred in it, not, indeed, from Judas's selfish motive (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>), but because they did not clearly apprehend the Divinity of Christ, nor the unspeakable sacredness of that body which was about to be the instrument of man's redemption. <span class="cmt_word">To what purpose is this waste</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)pw/leia</span>)? Wordsworth notes that Judas is called <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>). A fitting question truly for him to ask! The objectors saw no practical usefulness in the expenditure of this costly substance. If it was thought proper to show respect to their Master, a much inferior oil would have equally effected this purpose, or a few drops of the more precious unguent would have sufficed. So nowadays one hears complaints of money being expended in the rich decoration of churches, etc., when there are starving multitudes whom it would have relieved. But God himself has sanctioned the use of precious materials and of exquisite workmanship in temples built in his honour, and in the accessories of his public worship; the interests of the poor are not overlooked in such expenditure; they who give of their substance for such purposes are just those who feel all their responsibilities, and know that they serve Christ in ministering to his needy members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
