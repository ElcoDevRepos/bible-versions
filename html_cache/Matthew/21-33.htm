This method of teaching was common in Jewish tradition and allowed listeners to engage with the story on multiple levels. Parables were designed to reveal truths to those open to understanding while concealing them from those who were not receptive.<p><b>There was a landowner who planted a vineyard:</b><br>The landowner represents God, and the vineyard symbolizes Israel, a common metaphor in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). God is depicted as the one who establishes and cares for His people, expecting them to bear fruit.<p><b>He put a wall around it:</b><br>The wall signifies protection and separation, indicating God's provision and care for Israel. It also implies a boundary that sets apart the people of God from the surrounding nations, emphasizing holiness and dedication to God.<p><b>Dug a winepress in it:</b><br>The winepress is a tool for producing wine, symbolizing the expectation of fruitfulness and productivity. In a spiritual sense, it represents the fruits of righteousness that God desires from His people.<p><b>And built a tower:</b><br>The tower serves as a lookout for protection and oversight, suggesting God's vigilance and watchfulness over Israel. It also implies a place of refuge and security, highlighting God's role as a protector.<p><b>Then he rented it out to some tenants:</b><br>The tenants represent the leaders of Israel, such as the religious authorities, who were entrusted with the care and spiritual leadership of the people. This arrangement indicates a responsibility to manage and cultivate what belongs to God.<p><b>And went away on a journey:</b><br>The landowner's departure signifies God's trust in the leaders to fulfill their duties. It also suggests a period of testing or waiting, where the true character and faithfulness of the tenants would be revealed. This phrase can also allude to the patience and long-suffering nature of God, who gives time for repentance and fruitfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who establishes and provides for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes Israel, God's chosen people, and by extension, the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wall,_winepress,_watchtower.htm">Wall, Winepress, Watchtower</a></b><br>These elements indicate the care and provision God has made for His people, ensuring their protection and productivity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tenants.htm">Tenants</a></b><br>Represent the leaders of Israel, who were entrusted with the care of God's people but failed in their responsibilities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/journey.htm">Journey</a></b><br>Indicates God's trust in humanity to manage His creation and His patience in awaiting their response.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_care.htm">God's Provision and Care</a></b><br>God has provided abundantly for His people, equipping them with everything needed to thrive spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_and_stewardship.htm">Responsibility and Stewardship</a></b><br>We are entrusted with the care of God's kingdom, and we must be faithful stewards of what He has given us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>There is an expectation of fruitfulness and faithfulness; God will hold us accountable for how we manage His gifts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_of_god's_messengers.htm">Rejection of God's Messengers</a></b><br>Historically, God's people have rejected His prophets and messengers.

Yet stewardship matters: leaders and people alike must yield the fruit of obedience. Though God may seem distant, He will return to settle accounts. The passage invites us to recognize His ownership, rest in His protection, and labor faithfully until He comes (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Which planted a vineyard.</span>--The frequent recurrence of this imagery at this period of our Lord's ministry is significant. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-28.htm" title="But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.">Matthew 21:28</a>; <a href="/luke/13-6.htm" title="He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.">Luke 13:6</a>.) The parable that now meets us points in the very form of its opening to the great example of the use of that image in <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1</a>. Taking the thought there suggested as the key to the parable, the vineyard is "the house of Israel;" the "fence" finds its counterpart in the institutions which made Israel a separate and peculiar people; the "wine-press" (better, <span class= "ital">wine-vat</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the reservoir underneath the press), in the Temple, as that into which the "wine" of devotion, and thanksgiving, and charity was to flow; the "tower" (used in vineyards as a place of observation and defence against the attacks of plunderers; comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>), in Jerusalem and the outward polity connected with it. So, in like manner, the letting out to husbandmen and the going "into a far country" answers historically to the conquest by which the Israelites became possessors of Canaan, and were left, as it were, to themselves to make what use they chose of their opportunities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-46.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the vineyard let out to husbandmen</span>. (<a href="/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-12</a>; <a href="/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear another parable.</span> The domineering and lately imperious party are reduced to the position of pupils; they have to listen to teaching, not to give it; to answer, not to put questions. This parable sets forth, under the guise of history, the Pharisaical party in its official character, and as the representative of the nation. It also denounces the punishment that surely awaited these rejecters of the offered salvation; thus exemplifying the teaching of the withered fig tree (vers. 17-20). As applicable to the Jewish nation generally, it represents the long suffering of God and the various means which, in the course of their history, he had used to urge them to do their duty as his servants; and it ends with a prophecy of the coming events, and the terrible issue of impenitence. We must take the parable as partly retrospective, and partly predictive. <span class="cmt_word">There was a certain householder;</span> <span class="accented">a<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> <span class="accented">man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">that was an householder</span>. Christ in his parables often, as here, introduces God in his dealings with mankind as a man. His house is the house of Israel in particular, and in general the whole human family. <span class="cmt_word">A vineyard.</span> God's kingdom upon earth, and particularly the Jewish Church. The figure is common throughout Scripture (see on Matthew 20:1). <span class="cmt_word">It was planted</span> when God gave Israel a law, and put them in possession of the promised land. The parable itself is founded on <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where, however, the vineyard is tended by the Lord himself, not by husbandmen, and it bears wild grapes, not good grapes. By these differences different developments of declension are indicated. In the earlier times it was the nation that apostatized, fell into idolatry and rebellion against God, the theocratical Head of their race and polity. In later days it is the teachers, rabbis, priests, false prophets, who neglect the paths of righteousness, and lead people astray. In the parable these last come into painful prominence as criminally guilty of opposing God's messengers. <span class="cmt_word">Hedged it round;</span> <span class="accented">put a hedge around it</span>. The fence would be a stone wall - a necessary defence against the incursions of wild animals. This fence has been regarded in two senses - first, as referring to the physical peculiarities of the position of the Holy Land, separated from alien nations by deserts, seas, rivers, and so isolated from evil contagion; second, as intimating the peculiar laws and minute restrictions of the Jewish polity, which differentiated Judaism from all other systems of religion, and tended to preserve purity and incorruption. Probably the "hedge" is meant to adumbrate both senses. Many, however, see in it the protection of angels, or the righteousness of saints, which seem hardly to be sufficiently precise for the context. <span class="cmt_word">Digged a winepress</span>. The phrase refers, not to the ordinary wooden troughs or vats which were used for the purpose of expressing and receiving the juice of the grapes, but to such as were cut in the rock, and were common in all parts of the country. Remains of these receptacles meet the traveller everywhere on the hill slopes of Judaea, and notably in the valleys of Carmel. The winepress is taken to signify the prophetic spirit, the temple services, or all things that typified the sacrifice and death of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">A tower;</span> for the purpose of watching and guarding the vineyard. This may represent the temple itself, or the civil power. Whatever interpretation may be put upon the various details, which, indeed, should not be unduly pressed, the general notion is that every care was taken of the Lord's inheritance, nothing was wanting for its convenience and security. <span class="cmt_word">Let it out to husbandmen.</span> This is a new feature introduced into Isaiah's parable. Instead of paying an annual sum of money to the proprietor, these vine dressers payed in kind, furnishing a stipulated amount of fruit or wine as the hire of the vineyard. We have a lease on the former terms in <a href="/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>, where the keepers have "to bring a thousand pieces of silver for the fruit." The husbandmen are the children of Israel, who had to do their part in the Church, and show fruits of piety and devotion. <span class="cmt_word">Went into a far country;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">went abroad</span>. In the parabolic sense, God withdrew for a time the sensible tokens of his presence, no longer manifested himself as at Sinai, and in the cloud and pillar of fire. "Innuitur tempus divinae taciturnitatis, ubi homines agunt pro arbitrio" (Bengel). God's long suffering gives time of probation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Listen to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(akousate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
