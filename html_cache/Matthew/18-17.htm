The refusal to listen indicates a hardened heart, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as Pharaoh's refusal to heed Moses in Exodus. The process of confrontation is rooted in the Jewish legal system, where multiple witnesses were required to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>tell it to the church.</b><br>The term "church" (Greek: ekklesia) here refers to the assembly of believers, not a building. This is one of the earliest uses of the term in the New Testament, indicating the communal aspect of early Christian life. The church acts as a body of accountability, reflecting the communal nature of Israel in the Old Testament, where the community played a role in maintaining holiness (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>).<p><b>And if he refuses to listen even to the church,</b><br>This highlights the gravity of the situation. The church, as the body of Christ, represents the final earthly authority in matters of discipline. The refusal to heed the church's counsel shows a rejection of communal and divine authority, paralleling the rejection of prophets in the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>).<p><b>regard him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.</b><br>Pagans and tax collectors were often viewed as outsiders and sinners in Jewish society. Jesus' instruction here is not about ostracism but about recognizing the individual's separation from the community due to unrepentance. This mirrors the Old Testament practice of cutting off those who violated the covenant (<a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30-31</a>). However, Jesus' own ministry to tax collectors and sinners (<a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10-13</a>) suggests that this separation is not without hope for restoration through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, providing guidance on how to handle sin and conflict within the Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The assembly of believers, which serves as the final earthly authority in resolving disputes among Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unrepentant_brother.htm">The Unrepentant Brother</a></b><br>A member of the Christian community who refuses to repent after being confronted about their sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagans_and_tax_collectors.htm">Pagans and Tax Collectors</a></b><br>In the context of first-century Judaism, these were often seen as outsiders or those living outside the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_church_in_discipline.htm">The Role of the Church in Discipline</a></b><br>The church is not just a place of worship but also a community that holds its members accountable to live according to biblical standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>The process outlined by Jesus emphasizes the need for repentance and reconciliation.

This protects the purity of the church, seeks the sinner&#8217;s restoration, and honors the Lord who said, &#8220;For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">If he shall neglect to hear them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">refuse,</span> the word implying something more than mere negligence.<p><span class= "bld">Tell it unto the church.</span>--Here, and here only in our Lord's teaching after the promise to Peter (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>), we have the word <span class= "ital">Ecclesia</span> repeated. The passage takes its place among the most conspicuous instances of the power of a word. Theories of church authority, as exercised by the priesthood, or bishops, or councils, or the personal infallibility of the Bishop of Rome, have been built upon it. The last clause has been made the groundwork of the system of church discipline which loads the heretic with anathemas, excommunicates the evil-doer, places nations under an interdict. It can scarcely be doubted that the current thoughts and language of Englishmen as to ecclesiastical discipline would have been very different, if instead of "tell it unto the church," "if he neglect to hear the church," we had had the word "congregation." And yet this, or some such word (say "assembly" or "society"), is confessedly the true meaning of the Greek, and was the rendering of all the English versions, from Tyndale onwards, till the Rhemish translators introduced "church," and were followed by the Authorised version.<p>So understood, the words point to the final measures for the reformation of the offender, and the vindication of the divine law of righteousness. When the two forms of private remonstrance have failed, the case is to be brought before the society at large. The appeal is to be made not to the rulers of the congregation, but to the congregation itself, and the public opinion of the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia</span> is to be brought to bear upon the offender. Should he defy that opinion and persist in his evil doing, he practically excommunicates himself. All societies are justified in excluding from their communion one who repudiates the very conditions of membership; and his being regarded as "a heathen and a publican" is but the legitimate consequence of his own act. Even here, however, we can hardly think of our Lord as holding up the Pharisees' way of acting towards "the heathen and the publican" as a pattern for imitation. They were to be made to feel that they were no longer within the inner circle of brotherhood, but they were still men, and, as such, entitled to courtesy and all kindly offices. St. Paul's teaching as to the treatment of the incestuous adulterer in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1-5</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6-7</a>, and of fornicators generally in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1Corinthians 6:1-7</a>, may be referred to as a practical illustration of the meaning of our Lord's words.<p>It is obvious that the rule, as such, presupposes a small society, in the midst of a greater outside world, able to deal thus minutely with the offences of individual members. With the extension of the society, so that the church and the world became conterminous and hardly distinguishable, it was natural, perhaps, that it should follow the course of other human societies, and transfer its jurisdiction from the "congregation," or "assembly," to individual judges as its representatives. And so it was that, in the long-run, the bishops took the place of the congregation, and exercised its functions. So long as they were really in harmony with the mind of the church at large, this might work well enough, but there was the risk of their "lording it over God's heritage" (<a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.">1Peter 5:3</a>); and, in any case, there was the loss of that activity of the reason and conscience of the society which the original form of polity implied, and of which St. Paul's appeal to its judgment as against the inconsistency of the chief of the Apostles, is a very striking instance (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>). How far that can be revived is one of the hard questions of our own time and, perhaps, of all times. The end may have to be attained by very different means. We cannot inform the Universal or the National Church of the misdeeds of each individual member. Practically, to submit them formally to the judgments even of the smaller society of the town or village to which the offender belonged, would not be workable. Possibly, the solution of the problem may be found in remembering that in a Christian nation the Church and the State, as far as morality is concerned, tend, in spite of doctrinal divisions, to be, as was said, conterminous, and hence that we are fulfilling the spirit of our Lord's commands when, after all private remonstrances have failed to check the evil, we appeal to the public opinion of Christians in the neighbourhood, larger and smaller, which is affected by it. How this is to be done will vary with the varying circumstances of each individual case, but it is no idle paradox to say that as society is now constituted, the most effective way of "telling the church" may sometimes be to appeal to that public opinion as represented by lawful courts, or otherwise impartially expressed. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell it unto the Church</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>). This is the third step to take. Our Lord is contemplating a visible society, possessed of certain powers of discipline and correction, such as we find in the history of the apostolic Church (see <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, etc.; 1 Corinthians 6:1, etc.; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>). Christ had already spoken of his Ecclesia in his commendation of Peter's great confession (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>); so the twelve were prepared for this use of the word, and would not confound the body here signified with the Jewish synagogue. To the latter the expressions in vers. 18-20 could not apply. The custom and order of procedure in the synagogue would afford an idea of what the Lord meant; but the congregation intended was to be composed of Christians. the followers of Christ, who were delivered from the narrowness of rabbinical rules and definitions. The institution of ecclesiastical tribunals has been referred to this passage, but, as understood by the apostles, it would denote, not so much ecclesiastical rulers as the particular congregation to which the delinquent belonged; and the offence for which he is denounced is some private scandal or quarrel. The course of proceeding enjoined would be impracticable in a large and widely extended community, and could not be applied under our present circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">If he neglect to hear the Church</span>. Now comes the final stage in corrective discipline. <span class="cmt_word">An heathen man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the Gentile</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and a publican</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the publican</span>). The class, not the individual, is meant. If he turns a deaf ear to the authoritative reproof of the Church, let him be regarded no longer as a brother, but as a heathen and an outcast. Christ, without endorsing the Jews' treatment of Gentiles and publicans, acknowledges the fact, and uses it as an illustration. The obdurate offender must be deprived of Church membership, and treated as those without the Jewish pale were commonly treated. The traditional law enjoined that a Hebrew might not associate, eat, or travel with a heathen, and that if any Jew took the office of <span class="accented">publicans</span>, he was to be virtually excommunicated. In later times, there naturally arose in the Christian Church the punishment of offenders by means of exclusion from holy communion, and excommunication. But even in this extreme case charity will not regard the sinner as hopelessly lost; it will seek his salvation by prayer and entreaty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
