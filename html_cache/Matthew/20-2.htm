This coin, typically made of silver, was the standard payment for a day's work, reflecting the economic practices of the Roman Empire. The agreement to pay a denarius underscores the fairness and sufficiency of the wage, aligning with the cultural expectations of the time. This phrase also highlights the landowner's integrity and the workers' acceptance of the terms, setting the stage for the parable's later exploration of grace and generosity. The denarius can be seen as a symbol of God's provision, echoing the daily bread mentioned in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p><b>and sent them into his vineyard</b><br>The vineyard is a significant biblical motif, often representing Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) or the Kingdom of God. In this parable, the vineyard symbolizes the realm of God's work and mission. The act of sending workers into the vineyard reflects the call to participate in God's purposes, reminiscent of Jesus sending out His disciples (<a href="/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5-8</a>). The vineyard setting also evokes the imagery of fruitfulness and harvest, themes prevalent in Jesus' teachings (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>). This phrase invites reflection on the nature of divine calling and the privilege of laboring in God's service, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Kingdom where all are invited to contribute, regardless of the hour they begin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and just in His dealings with humanity.

The denarius (always translated "a penny" in our version) was a silver coin about equal in value to the French franc, but of course in its buying capacities worth in those days a great deal more. We learn from Tacitus ('Annal.,' 1:17) that it was the usual pay of a Roman soldier. It was equivalent to the Greek drachma, which Tobit (5:14) offered to Azarias as daily wages. Our rendering of "a penny" conveys a very erroneous impression to unlearned hearers, both in this passage and in other places where it occurs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He agreed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#956;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(symph&#333;n&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4856.htm">Strong's 4856: </a> </span><span class="str2">To agree with, harmonize with, agree together.
