In biblical times, servants often worked closely together, forming tight-knit groups. The fellow servants' observation suggests a shared moral compass and a collective sense of justice. This reflects the broader biblical principle of communal responsibility, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1-2</a>, where believers are encouraged to bear one another's burdens.<p><b>they were greatly distressed</b><br>The emotional response of the fellow servants indicates a deep sense of injustice and moral outrage. This distress can be compared to the reaction of the Israelites when they witnessed wrongdoing among their people, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/5-6.htm">Nehemiah 5:6-7</a>. The distress also underscores the expectation of mercy and forgiveness within the community, aligning with the teachings of Jesus on forgiveness, such as in <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>.<p><b>and they went and recounted all of this to their master</b><br>The action of reporting to the master demonstrates the hierarchical structure of authority in ancient times, where servants were accountable to their master. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where God is the ultimate judge and authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>. The act of recounting the events to the master also parallels the concept of prayer and confession in Christianity, where believers bring their concerns and grievances before God, trusting in His righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fellow_servants.htm">Fellow Servants</a></b><br>These are the other servants who witness the actions of the unforgiving servant.

The verse teaches that believers live before watchful eyes, should lament unmerciful conduct, must respond biblically, and ultimately leave judgment to the Lord. Genuine disciples, mindful of the mercy they&#8217;ve received, are called to extend that same mercy, knowing the Master still hears every report.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">They were very sorry.</span>--The fellow-servants are, of course, in the inner meaning of the parable, those who are members of the same spiritual society. Our Lord appeals as by anticipation to the judgment which Christians in general, perhaps even to that which mankind at large, would pass upon such conduct. It is suggestive that He describes them, not as being angry or indignant (though such feelings would have been natural enough), but as "exceeding sorry." Sorrow, rather than anger, is the mood of the true disciple of Christ as he witnesses the sins against love which are the scandals of the Christian society. Anger, the righteous wrath against evil, belongs rather, as in <a href="/matthew/18-32.htm" title="Then his lord, after that he had called him, said to him, O you wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you desired me:">Matthew 18:32</a>, to the Lord and Judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fellow servants.</span> Those in the same condition of life as the incarcerated debtor.

These have a fellow feeling for the sinner, in that they are conscious that in their own heart there are germs of evil which, unchecked, may develop into similar wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Told</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">told clearly</span>.
