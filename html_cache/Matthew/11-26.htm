This term is used frequently in the New Testament to denote a close, familial relationship with God, contrasting with the more formal titles used in the Old Testament. It highlights the new covenant relationship believers have with God through Christ. The use of "Yes" indicates Jesus' agreement and submission to the Father's will, a theme consistent throughout His ministry (e.g., <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<p><b>for this was well-pleasing</b><br>The phrase "well-pleasing" suggests that God's actions and decisions are inherently good and align with His perfect will. This reflects the biblical theme that God's wisdom and plans are beyond human understanding but are always for the ultimate good (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The context of <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-26</a> shows Jesus praising God for revealing truths to "little children" rather than the "wise and learned," indicating God's pleasure in humility and faith over human wisdom and pride.<p><b>in Your sight</b><br>This phrase underscores the omniscience of God, who sees and knows all things. It implies that God's perspective is perfect and complete, unlike human understanding. The idea of being "in Your sight" is a reminder of living in a way that is pleasing to God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>. It also connects to the biblical theme of God's approval being more important than human approval, as seen in <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His Father in prayer, expressing submission to God's will and wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' prayer, God the Father is acknowledged as the one whose will is perfect and pleasing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the audience of Jesus' teachings and are learning about the nature of God's revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_and_learned.htm">The Wise and Learned</a></b><br>In the broader context, Jesus contrasts the revelation given to "little children" with the hiddenness from the "wise and learned."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_children.htm">Little Children</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who are humble and open to receiving God's revelation, representing a childlike faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_will.htm">God's Sovereign Will</a></b><br>God's decisions and actions are always perfect and pleasing, even when they are beyond human understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_faith.htm">Humility in Faith</a></b><br>Embrace a childlike faith, characterized by humility and openness to God's revelation, rather than relying solely on human wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_wisdom.htm">Trust in Divine Wisdom</a></b><br>Trust that God's ways, though sometimes mysterious, are ultimately for our good and His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_god's_plan.htm">Submission to God's Plan</a></b><br>Like Jesus, we should submit to God's will, trusting that His plans are well-pleasing and perfect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_to_the_humble.htm">Revelation to the Humble</a></b><br>God reveals His truths to those who approach Him with humility and a teachable spirit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_11_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 11:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_26_God_s_truth_to_believers.htm">How does Matthew 11:26 demonstrate God's sovereignty in revealing truth to believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Humility_s_role_in_God_s_will_Matt_11_26.htm">What role does humility play in understanding God's will, as seen in Matthew 11:26?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_prayers_with_God_s_will_9.htm">How can we align our prayers with God's pleasure, as stated in Matthew 11:26?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matt_11_26_Prov_3_5-6_on_trust.htm">How does Matthew 11:26 connect with Proverbs 3:5-6 about trusting God's wisdom?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_gratefully_accept_God_s_will.htm">In what ways can we accept God's decisions with gratitude, following Matthew 11:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_God_s_will_in_Matt_11_26.htm">Why does Matthew 11:26 emphasize God's will in revealing truths to the humble?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_26_vs_human_wisdom.htm">How does Matthew 11:26 challenge the concept of human wisdom and understanding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Matthew_11_26_in_Jesus_work.htm">What is the historical context of Matthew 11:26 in Jesus' ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_uzziah's_father.htm">Who was the father of Uzziah?

The two verses are remarkable as the only record outside St. John's Gospel of a prayer like that which we find in John 17. For the most part, we may believe, those prayers were offered apart on the lonely hill-side, in the darkness of night; or, it may be, the disciples shrank in their reverence, or perhaps in the consciousness of their want of capacity, from attempting to record what was so unspeakably sacred. But it is noteworthy that in this exceptional instance we find, both in the prayer and the teaching that follows it in St. Matthew and St. Luke, turns of thought and phrase almost absolutely identical with what is most characteristic of St. John. It is as though the isolated fragment of a higher teaching had been preserved by them as a witness that there was a region upon which they scarcely dared to enter, but into which men were to be led afterwards by the beloved disciple, to whom the Spirit gave power to recall what had been above the reach of the other reporters of his Master's teaching.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Yes,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(nai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3483.htm">Strong's 3483: </a> </span><span class="str2">Yes, certainly, even so.
