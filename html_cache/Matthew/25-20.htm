In the cultural context of the time, a talent was a significant sum of money, indicating the master's trust in the servant's abilities. The servant's action of presenting five more talents demonstrates diligence and faithfulness. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, where faithfulness in small matters leads to greater responsibilities. The act of doubling the talents can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth and fruitfulness, aligning with the parable's broader theme of using God-given gifts for His glory.<p><b>&#8216;Master,&#8217; he said, &#8216;you entrusted me with five talents.</b><br>The term "Master" reflects the hierarchical relationship between the servant and the master, symbolizing the believer's relationship with God. The word "entrusted" indicates a transfer of responsibility and trust, emphasizing the importance of stewardship. This echoes the biblical theme of God entrusting His followers with spiritual gifts and resources, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>. The number five, often associated with grace in biblical numerology, suggests that the talents are a gift from God, meant to be used wisely and productively.<p><b>See, I have gained five more.&#8217;</b><br>The servant's report of gaining five more talents signifies successful stewardship and the multiplication of resources. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as stated in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The doubling of the talents can be seen as a type of Christ's work in believers, where spiritual investments yield eternal rewards. This phrase also connects to the idea of bearing fruit, as described in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where abiding in Christ leads to abundant spiritual fruitfulness. The servant's success serves as an encouragement for believers to actively engage in their God-given missions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who entrusts His followers with responsibilities and resources.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers who are given gifts and talents to steward for God's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/talents.htm">Talents</a></b><br>A measure of wealth in biblical times, representing the resources, gifts, and opportunities God gives to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The moment of accountability when the servant presents his gains to the master, symbolizing the final judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>The period during which the master is away, representing the current age where believers are to work faithfully until Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>Believers are called to be faithful with the resources and opportunities God provides, using them to further His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>There will be a time of reckoning where each person must give an account of their stewardship to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/multiplication_of_gifts.htm">Multiplication of Gifts</a></b><br>God expects us to use and multiply the gifts He has given us, not to hide or squander them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Our actions and stewardship in this life have eternal consequences and rewards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_service.htm">Active Service</a></b><br>The Christian life is one of active service, not passive waiting.

In the kingdom of God the gain commonly takes another form than the mere increase of the gifts or opportunities which we call "talents" (though even here that increase is often the result of faithfulness), and appears as good done to men and souls gained for God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that had received</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="cmt_word">five talents</span>. The slaves appear in the same order as they had come to receive the deposits. The first comes joyfully, showing boldness in his day of judgment (<a href="/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>), because he has dealt faithfully and diligently, and prospered in his labours. <span class="cmt_word">Thou deliveredst unto me.</span> He rightly acknowledges that all he had came from his lord, and that it was his duty and his pleasure to increase the deposit for his master's benefit. The long delay had not made him careless and negligent; rather, he had used the time profitably, and thereby added greatly to his gains. <span class="cmt_word">I have gained beside them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The two last words are omitted by Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, and the Revised Version. If they are not genuine, they are, at any rate, implied in the account of the transaction. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Alia quinque superlucratus sum.</span> The good servant says, <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>, as if he pointed with joy to the augmented wealth of his master. He does not speak boastfully; he does not praise himself for his success; he had simply done his best with the means entrusted to him, and he can speak of the result with real pleasure (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>). So in a religious sense the obligation to improve talents is even more imperative. "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one to profit withal" (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>). The grace which he receives he must employ for his own sanctification, as a member of Christ, for the edification of others, for the interests of God's Church; such work will show that he is worthy of his Lord's trust and faithful in his stewardship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [servant]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
