The path, known as the Via Dolorosa, is traditionally believed to be the route Jesus took. This journey is significant as it fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would bear the sins of many.<p><b>they found a man from Cyrene</b><br>Cyrene was a city in North Africa, in present-day Libya. This detail highlights the diverse backgrounds of those present in Jerusalem during Passover, as Cyrene had a significant Jewish population. The mention of Cyrene connects to <a href="/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>, where Jews from Cyrene were present at Pentecost, indicating the widespread reach of the Jewish diaspora.<p><b>named Simon</b><br>Simon is a common Jewish name, suggesting he was likely a Jew visiting Jerusalem for Passover. His involvement in this event is significant, as it shows the unexpected ways individuals are drawn into the narrative of Jesus' passion. Simon's role is a reminder of the call to discipleship, where one may be asked to bear burdens unexpectedly.<p><b>and they forced him</b><br>The Roman soldiers had the authority to compel individuals to perform tasks, a practice known as impressment. This reflects the oppressive nature of Roman rule and the humiliation Jesus faced. The act of forcing Simon underscores the involuntary nature of his participation, yet it becomes a profound moment of sharing in Christ's suffering.<p><b>to carry the cross of Jesus</b><br>Carrying the cross was a part of the Roman execution process, symbolizing the condemned's submission to Roman authority. Jesus, weakened from scourging, was unable to carry it alone. Simon's act of carrying the cross prefigures the call to Christians to take up their cross and follow Jesus, as stated in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>. This moment also fulfills the typology of the suffering servant, bearing the weight of sin on behalf of others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_of_cyrene.htm">Simon of Cyrene</a></b><br>A man from Cyrene, a city in North Africa, who was compelled by the Roman soldiers to carry the cross of Jesus.

Why, we ask, out of the whole crowd that was streaming to and fro, on the way to the place of execution, did the multitude seize on him? St. Mark's mention of him as the father of Alexander and Rufus (see Note on <a href="/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a>), suggests the thought that his sons were afterwards prominent as members of the Christian community. May we not infer that he was suspected even then of being a secret disciple, and that this led the people to seize on him, and make him a sharer in the humiliation of his Master? He was coming, St. Mark adds, "out of the country."<p><span class= "bld">Him they compelled.</span>--The word is the technical term for forced service (see Note on <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm" title="And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.">Matthew 5:41</a>). The act implied that our Lord was sinking beneath the burden, and that the soldiers began to fear that He might die before they reached the place of execution. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As</span> <span class="cmt_word">they came out;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the city gate which led to the place of execution. <span class="cmt_word">They found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name.</span> He was, as the other synoptists mention, coming out of the country to Jerusalem, where probably he lived. Cyrene was a district in the north of Africa, under Roman rule, and colonized by a large number of Jews (Josephus, 'Cont. Apion.,' 2:4; 'Ant.,' 14:07. 2), who had a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>). Simon doubtless became a follower of Christ, and St. Mark mentions his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, as well known believers (see <a href="/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>). Probably the guards saw in him some tokens of sympathy with Christ and compassion for his sufferings; or they used his services simply as being a foreigner, and not likely to resent being put to a task which a Hebrew would deem the lowest degradation. <span class="cmt_word">Him</span> <span class="cmt_word">they compelled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">impressed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to bear his cross.</span> The verb translated "compelled" is derived from the Persian, and implies the compulsory power possessed by couriers of requisitioning horses and carriages in forwarding despatches (see <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>). The cross was probably the ordinary Latin cross, <span class="accented">crux immissa</span>, of which, however, the lower limb below the transom was longer than the upper; and this latter afforded a place where could be affixed the board containing the inscription. It was not as tall as usually represented; we are told that beasts of prey were able to gnaw the bodies hung thereon. In fact, the culprit's feet were only just raised above the ground, being drawn up till the soles lay flat on the upright beam. Nails were driven through the hands and feet, and the body was supported partly by these, and partly by a projecting pin of wood called the seat. The rest for the feet, often seen in pictures, was never used. A slight covering was allowed for decency's sake, the rest of the body being stripped of clothing; and thus the condemned, exposed to scorching sun, bleeding from the cruel scourge, suffering untold agonies, was left to die. Whether Jesus carried the whole cross or only the transom is uncertain. It is possible that the two were tied together by a rope at one end, so as to form an inverted V, and fastened in the proper position at the place of execution. However this may he, it proved too heavy a burden for him to bear. Spent with his long vigil and lack of food, his spirit afflicted by the agony in the garden and the unknown sufferings then and afterwards, his body tortured with open wounds and weakened with loss of blood, he sank beneath the weight, as he staggered weariedly along the rough and hilly streets, Either from a momentary compunction, or more probably flora impatience at the slowness of the poor Sufferer's movements, the soldiers gladly seized on Simon to relieve the Prisoner of the cross, or to share its weight, and thus enable them sooner to complete their cruel task. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Along the way</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8023;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(heuron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anthr&#333;pon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_444.htm">Strong's 444: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man, one of the human race.
