Their appearance verifies Jesus as the realization of that hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Appeared before them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Before them&#8221; highlights that the disciples truly saw Moses and Elijah, affirming the literal, historical nature of the event (cf. <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God graciously grants these witnesses a preview of the Kingdom&#8217;s glory, strengthening their faith before the coming trials (cf. <a href="/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene also anticipates believers&#8217; future fellowship with departed saints in Christ&#8217;s presence (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Talking with Jesus</b><p>&#8226; Luke records they &#8220;spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>). The Law and Prophets converse with their Fulfillment about the cross and resurrection.<p>&#8226; This dialogue signals that Jesus&#8217; redemptive mission is the central theme tying Scripture together (cf. <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>; <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>).<p>&#8226; The posture of Moses and Elijah&#8212;speaking with, not above, Jesus&#8212;declares His supremacy over even the greatest Old Testament figures (cf. <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; For the disciples, hearing this conversation confirms that the path of suffering Jesus foretold is neither accidental nor defeat but the ordained plan of God (cf. <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/17-3.htm">Matthew 17:3</a> records a literal, historical moment when God suddenly unveils the Law-giver and the foremost Prophet alongside His Son. Their appearance before the disciples authenticates Jesus as the fulfillment of every promise and prophecy, while their conversation about His impending sacrifice centers all Scripture on the redemptive work of Christ. The scene reassures believers that God&#8217;s plan unfolds precisely, triumphantly, and visibly in Jesus, the One greater than Moses or Elijah, the One in whom the Law and the Prophets find their glorious completion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Moses and Elias.</span>--The identification of the forms which the disciples saw was, we may well believe, intuitive. If we accept the narrative as a whole, it is legitimate to assume that, in the state of consciousness to which they had been raised, they were capable of a spiritual illumination which would reveal to them who they were who were thus recognising their Master's work and doing homage to His majesty. There was, it is obvious, a singular fitness in each case. One was the great representative of the Law, which was a "school master" or "servant-tutor" (see Note on <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>) leading men to Christ, the other of the whole goodly fellowship of the prophets. Of one it had been said that a "Prophet like unto him" should come in the latter days (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm" title="I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brothers, like to you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>), to whom men should hearken; of the other, that he should come again to "turn the hearts of the fathers to the children" (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>). The close of the ministry of each was not after the "common death of all men." No man knew of the sepulchre of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm" title="And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>), and Elijah had passed away in the chariots and horses of fire (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.">2Kings 2:11</a>). Both were associated in men's minds with the glory of the kingdom of the Christ. The Jerusalem Targum on Exodus 12 connects the coming of Moses with that of the Messiah. Another Jewish tradition predicts his appearance with that of Elijah. Their presence now was an attestation that their work was over, and that the Christ had come.<p><span class= "bld">Talking with him.</span>--St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>) adds the subject of their communing: "They spake of His decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem." So far as the disciples then entered into the meaning of what they heard, or afterwards recalled it, it was a witness that the spirits of the lawgiver and the prophet accepted the sufferings and the death which had shaken the faith of the disciples as the necessary conditions of the Messianic kingdom. It is significant that the word for "decease" (<span class= "ital">exodos</span>) reappears in this sense once only in the New Testament, and then in close connection with a reference to the Transfiguration (<a href="/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> The exclamation, thrice repeated (ver. 5), marks the suddenness and unexpectedness of the occurrence. They who now appeared were no delusive, imaginary figures, but real personages, objectively presented to the spectators, in such bodies as appertained to their condition. <span class="cmt_word">Moses and Elias.</span> St. Luke adds, "who appeared in glory," radiant with the light which always accompanies heavenly visitors. Why these two saints were chosen to be present on this momentous occasion may be explained by various considerations. Both these worthies experienced something unparalleled in their departure from this life. Elijah was taken up to heaven without dying; Moses died, indeed, but he was buried by God in an unknown grave, and his body was under the especial care of Michael the archangel (see <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>), and we know not that it saw corruption. From the unseen world these were brought to do homage to the Messiah - Moses, a type of those blessed spirits who in Paradise await the final consummation, Elijah, a type of the saints who, after the resurrection, perfect in soul and body, shall enter into glory. Here were the representatives of the Law and the prophets, the principal supporters of the old covenant, honouring him who was introducing the new covenant, which was to fulfil and supersede the previous one. Spurious, degraded Judaism rejected Christ's claims; real, orthodox Judaism acknowledged him and reverenced him as the Christ foretold and fort, shadowed, "of whom Moses and the prophets did write" (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>). Now, too, it was made manifest that Jesus was not Elias or one of the prophets, as some erroneously had supposed, but different from and superior to all; that he had power over life and death, and could bring whom he would from the unseen World; that the cross and Passion were not degrading, or proofs of weakness, but glorious and triumphant accomplishments of the will or God. The question is asked - How did Peter and the rest recognize the two heavenly visitants? There may have been something conventional in their garb or appearance, which at once identified them; or the apostles may have known them by spiritual intuition or special revelation; or they may have gathered their knowledge from the conversation which they overheard. Anyhow, it was necessary that the two should be recognized, otherwise their appearance would have lost its significance, and the confirmation which they were intended to afford would fail to be given. Is there here an intimation that in heaven the blessed will know each other, though they never met in the flesh - shall know even as they have been known? <span class="cmt_word">Talking with him.</span> St. Luke tells us the subject of this mysterious dialogue - they "spoke of his decease (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">exodus, departure</span>) which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem." They conversed, not of the glory which was his before the world began, nor of the kingdom which he came to establish, but of his coming suffering and death, with their tremendous issues. At the very moment of this revelation of Divinity, the discourse is of humiliation and the cross. The apostles had been slow to understand the future that awaited their Master; here the great saints of the covenant bore their testimony to Christ's fulfilment of what had been prophesied and shadowed aforehand, how by the sufferings of his sacred humanity eternal glory should be won. So might the apostles be strengthened to look forward without apprehension or weak shrinking; for through the grave and gate of death lay the road to a joyful resurrection and celestial happiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Suddenly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#969;&#971;&#963;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#333;us&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3475.htm">Strong's 3475: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Moses, or Mouses of Hebrew origin; Moseus, Moses, or Mouses, the Hebrew lawgiver.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Elijah</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7976;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;lias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2243.htm">Strong's 2243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah, the prophet.
