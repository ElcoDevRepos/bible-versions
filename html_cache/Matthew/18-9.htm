In biblical context, the "eye" often symbolizes desire or lust, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, where looking at someone with lust is equated with adultery. The hyperbolic language underscores the importance of spiritual purity and vigilance against temptation. Historically, Jewish teachings also stressed the importance of avoiding sin, though not through literal self-mutilation, but through discipline and repentance.<p><b>gouge it out and throw it away</b><br>The drastic imagery here is not meant to be taken literally but serves to illustrate the radical measures one should take to avoid sin. This reflects the Jewish rhetorical style of using hyperbole to make a point. The act of "throwing it away" signifies a complete and decisive break from sin, aligning with the biblical call for repentance and transformation, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>.<p><b>It is better for you to enter life with one eye</b><br>"Enter life" refers to entering eternal life or the Kingdom of Heaven. The phrase suggests that spiritual well-being and eternal destiny are far more important than physical completeness. This echoes Jesus' teachings on the value of the soul over the body, as in <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, where gaining the world is worthless if one loses their soul.<p><b>than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell</b><br>The "fire of hell" (Gehenna) is a reference to the Valley of Hinnom, a place outside Jerusalem associated with idolatry and child sacrifice in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). By Jesus' time, it had become a symbol of divine judgment and eternal punishment.
