The temple tax was a customary levy for the maintenance of the temple, rooted in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-16</a>. Jesus, though exempt as the Son of God, chooses to avoid unnecessary conflict, demonstrating humility and respect for established practices. This reflects the principle of not causing others to stumble, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13-21</a>.<p><b>go to the sea</b><br>The Sea of Galilee is the geographical setting, a significant location in Jesus' ministry. It was a hub for fishing, a common occupation in the region. This instruction to Peter, a fisherman by trade, connects to his background and expertise, emphasizing the practical nature of Jesus' miracles.<p><b>cast a hook</b><br>Unlike the typical use of nets, casting a hook suggests a specific, miraculous intervention. This method underscores the personal and direct nature of the miracle, contrasting with the usual collective fishing practices. It also highlights the precision of Jesus' command and the certainty of the outcome.<p><b>and take the first fish you catch</b><br>The specificity of "the first fish" indicates divine foreknowledge and control over creation. This act serves as a testament to Jesus' authority over nature, reminiscent of His calming of the storm in <a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-27</a>. It also symbolizes the provision of God, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<p><b>When you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin</b><br>The four-drachma coin, or stater, was equivalent to the temple tax for two people. This detail underscores the precision of the miracle and Jesus' provision for both Himself and Peter. The unexpected source of the coin highlights God's ability to provide in unforeseen ways, echoing the provision of manna in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>.<p><b>Take it and give it to them for My tax and yours</b><br>Jesus' inclusion of Peter in the payment signifies His solidarity with His disciples. It also reflects the fulfillment of legal and religious obligations, despite His divine exemption. This act prefigures Jesus' ultimate sacrifice, where He pays the debt of sin for humanity, as foreshadowed in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, who provides a miraculous solution to a practical problem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>- One of Jesus' disciples, tasked with carrying out the instructions given by Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>- Likely the Sea of Galilee, where Peter is instructed to fish.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_tax_collectors.htm">The Temple Tax Collectors</a></b><br>- Those who collect the two-drachma tax, which was a customary tax for the maintenance of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fish.htm">The Fish</a></b><br>- The miraculous means by which the tax money is provided.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>God provides for our needs in unexpected ways.

When they were last at Capernaum, the disciples, Peter probably their spokesman (<a href="/matthew/15-12.htm" title="Then came his disciples, and said to him, Know you that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?">Matthew 15:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-15.htm" title="Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable.">Matthew 15:15</a>), had remonstrated with their Master for proclaiming a bold, broad principle of spiritual morality against the traditions of the Schools: "Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended when they heard that saying?" Now He proclaims another principle, equally bold and far-reaching, and as certain to offend. He reminds the disciple of his former fear, sees that some such feeling is already rising up in his mind, and recognises that within certain limits it is legitimate. To have refused to pay the <span class= "ital">didrachma</span> on purely personal grounds would have been to claim prematurely that title of the Christ, the "Son of God," which He had told His disciples at this crisis not to claim for Him (<a href="/matthew/16-20.htm" title="Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.">Matthew 16:20</a>). To have done so on general grounds, common to Himself and others, would have been to utter a truth for which men were not prepared, and which they were certain to pervert. Those who had not learnt the higher law of the free gift of love would be tempted to make their freedom an excuse for giving nothing. Devout and generous minds would be shocked at what would seem to them to cut off the chief support of the outward glory of the House of God. The spirit in which our Lord spoke and acted was one with that which was the guide of St. Paul's life: "It is good" to surrender even the freedom which we might well claim, if by it "thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak" (<a href="/romans/14-21.htm" title="It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.">Romans 14:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A piece of money</span>.--The Greek gives the name of the coin, the <span class= "ital">stater.</span> It was reckoned as equal to four <span class= "ital">drachmae,</span> and would therefore pay the <span class= "ital">didrachma</span> both for Peter and his Master. Incidentally, we may note the light which this throws on the poverty of our Lord and His disciples. They had returned from their wanderings in the north of Palestine, occupying some three or four weeks, and they were now absolutely penniless, not so much as a <span class= "ital">stater</span> between them. The money was to be given for both, and so far, as has been said, our Lord includes Peter in the list of those who, as "children of the kingdom," might have claimed exemption. No payment is made for the other disciples: most probably they had homes of their own, where the <span class= "ital">didrachma</span> would be applied for, and were not living with Peter.<p>We cannot ignore the many points of contrast which difference this narrative from that of our Lord's miracles in general. (1.) There is no actual record that a miracle was wrought at all. We expect the narrative to end with the words, "and he went and found as it had been said unto him," but we do not find them. The story is told for the sake of the teaching, not of the wonder. Men have inferred that a miracle must have been wrought from a literal interpretation of the promise. (2.) On this assumption the wonder stands alone by itself in its nature and surroundings. It does not originate in our Lord's compassion, nor depend upon faith in the receiver, as in the miracles of healing, nor set forth a spiritual truth, like that of the withered fig-tree. It is so far distinct and peculiar. This would not in itself, perhaps, be of much, if any, weight against a direct statement of a fact, but it may be allowed to be of some significance in the exceptional and therefore conspicuous absence of such a statement. On these grounds some have been led to explain our Lord's words as meaning, in figurative language which the disciple would understand, that Peter was to catch the fish, and sell it for a <span class= "ital">stater.</span> Most interpreters, however, have been content to take our Lord's words in their literal sense, and to believe that they were literally fulfilled. If we accept this view the narrative has its parallel in the well-known story of the ring of Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos (Herod. iii. 39-41).<p><span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest we should offend them;</span> <span class="accented">cause them to stumble</span>. In his large charity he would not take the advantage of his position to avoid the tax. Though above the Law, he would place himself under the Law. Offence would be given by the nonpayment. His motive would be unknown and misunderstood (see on ver. 24). The people would attribute it to caprice, sectarianism, contempt of religion; they would see in it dishonour to the temple. Suspicion and animosity would be aroused; ill feeling, injurious both to themselves who encouraged it and to the cause of Christ, would weaken the effects of his acts and doctrine. Further offence would supervene if he did not confirm Peter's engagement and execute the promise which the foremost disciple had virtually made in his name; since it might thus appear that he and his followers were not of one mind in this important matter. For such considerations he was content to waive his prerogative, and to provide for the payment by a miracle, which should at once vindicate his royal character and demonstrate that, while he was obedient to the Law, he was superior to it, was the Lord of heaven and earth and sea. <span class="cmt_word">Go thou to the sea.</span> The Sea of Galilee, on whose shore Capernaum stood, and with which Peter had been all his life familiar. <span class="cmt_word">Cast an hook.</span> The fisherman was to ply his trade, yet not to use his customary net; he was to fish with line and hook, that the miracle might be more striking. <span class="cmt_word">Take up the fish that first cometh up.</span> From the deep waters to the bait. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt find a piece of money;</span> <span class="accented">a stater</span>. This Greek coin, circulating throughout the East, was about equal in value to the shekel, or two didrachms, and therefore sufficient to pay the half shekel for two persons. That fish should seize a bright object which might drop into the sea is nothing uncommon. A cod has been found with a watch in its stomach, still going. The miracle is shown in the omniscience which knew what the fish carried in its maw, and in the omnipotence which drew it to the hook. As far as we know, and regarding the present age as the sabbath of creation (see <a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), Christ in his miracles created nothing absolutely, always using a natural and existing basis as the support of the wonder. So here he does not create the fish or the skater, but by marvellous coincidences makes them subserve his purpose. Tradition has stereotyped the miracle by assigning to a certain tribe of fish a permanent mark of the occurrence. <span class="accented">The johndory</span>. whose name is corrupted either from <span class="accented">jaune dore</span>, "gold colour," or <span class="accented">adore</span>, "worshipped," is called in some countries Peter's fish, and is supposed to retain the impression of the apostle's fingers on its sides. Others assert that it is the haddock which presents this memorial of the miracle. But neither of these fish is found in the Lake of Gennesareth. <span class="cmt_word">Give... for me and thee</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)nti\ e)mou = kai\ sou = </span>). The form of expression recalls the original design of the institution, as a ransom of souls (comp. <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> in the Greek). He does not say, "for us;" for, though he submitted to the tax, it was not on the same ground as his servant. He himself paid, though exempt; Peter paid because he was liable. In the one ease it was from humility, in the other from legal obligation. The account ends somewhat abruptly, nothing being said of the result of the Lord's command, what action Peter took, and what ensued thereon. But we need no assurance that all came to pass as Christ directed. The very silence is significant; it is the sublimest language. Neologian criticism has endeavoured to explain away or to throw discredit on the miraculous nature of this "transaction." We are asked to believe that Christ by his command meant only that Peter was to go and catch a fish and sell it for a skater. If this was the case, why did not the evangelist say so? Why did he introduce a story which he must have known to be untrue? Is there any ground for supposing that St. Matthew was a writer of myths and legends, or one who intentionally falsified the records on which he framed his history? Surely no unprejudiced person could judge thus of the writer of the First Gospel; to those who believe in inspiration the notion is sacrilegious. The incident is no embellishment of a natural fact, no mere sailor's anecdote, but the true account of a real occurrence, which the narrator credited and probably witnessed. Another allegation equally unfounded is that Christ was rebuking Peter for precipitancy in promising payment when they had no funds in their possession, as though Jesus was saying ironically, "You had better go and catch a fish, and look for the money in its mouth!" Such attempted evasions of the miraculous are puerile and saddening. And if it be objected, as indeed it is, that the miracle was unnecessary and unworthy of Jesus, who never exerted his supernatural power for his own benefit, it is easy to show that the wonder was required in order to give and enforce a lesson to Peter and his companions. In what better way could Jesus have conveyed to them the truth that, although for the nonce he consented to the Law, he was superior to it and exempt from the obligation, and that if he paid the tax he did so by an exercise of power which proved him to be the Son of God? <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
