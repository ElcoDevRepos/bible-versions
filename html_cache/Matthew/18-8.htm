In biblical context, the hand and foot symbolize actions and paths in life. The metaphorical use of body parts highlights the personal responsibility in avoiding sin. The concept of sin causing separation from God is consistent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of man.<p><b>cut it off and throw it away.</b><br>This hyperbolic language is not a literal command but a call to radical action against sin. It reflects the Jewish teaching style of using exaggeration to make a point. The idea is to remove anything from one's life that leads to sin, similar to the call for spiritual purity found in passages like <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>, which urges believers to "put to death" earthly desires.<p><b>It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame</b><br>The phrase "enter life" refers to eternal life, a central theme in Christian doctrine. The imagery of being "crippled or lame" underscores the value of eternal life over physical wholeness. This teaching aligns with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where spiritual blessings are prioritized over earthly conditions.<p><b>than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.</b><br>"Eternal fire" is a reference to hell, a place of judgment and separation from God. This concept is consistent with other biblical references to hell, such as in <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14-15</a>.

Whatever fuels temptation must be dealt with immediately and decisively, because eternal life with Christ far outweighs any cost. Choosing holiness now secures joy forever; choosing sin now risks eternal fire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8, 9) <span class= "bld">If thy hand or thy foot offend thee.</span>--(See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.">Matthew 5:29-30</a>.) The disciples had heard the words before in the Sermon on the Mount, but their verbal reproduction, sharpened as by a special personal application addressed not to the multitude but to the Twelve, gave them a new and solemn emphasis.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>. The Lord teaches how to avoid this sin of giving offence, repeating the solemn words already delivered in the sermon on the mount, though with some variation and a different context (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29, 30</a>). The reference on the former occasion was especially to breaches of the seventh commandment; here the Lord speaks <span class="cmt_word">of</span> offences in general, of that external corruption among mankind which is the fruitful source of temptation and sin. The only remedy for this is the sternest self-denial, the strictest watchfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Or thy foot.</span> Christ did not name this member in his previous discourse. Literally, the hand or foot leads into sin, when it is directed to forbidden objects, moves towards the acquisition of things contrary to the Law of God. Metaphorically, the expression signifies all that is as dear and as necessary as these important members. Such occasions of sin we must at once and absolutely cast aside. It includes also persons as well as things. Friends the dearest must be parted from if their presence, or conversation, or habits cause evil thoughts or encourage evil acts. In the presence of such offences, ties the nearest must be snapped asunder. Loneliness, isolation, is better than companionship in wickedness. It has been well said by Olshausen that the hand and the foot may denote mental powers and dispositions; and the warning is given that their over-cultivation may prove an obstacle to the spiritual life, and must be accordingly checked. We may also descry in the paragraph an admonition against making too much of skill, dexterity, and adroitness in business and occupation. There is a subtle snare in them; they may draw the heart away from God, and must be restrained and modified, so as not to interfere with the cultivation of religion and the care of the soul. <span class="cmt_word">Enter into life.</span> This is an addition not found in the sermon on the mount; it refers to the eternal life which, beginning on earth, is consummated in heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Everlasting fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the first time that this phrase occurs. Whatever these words may mean, there can be no doubt that they signify, and are intended to signify, some awful kind and extent of punishment, the fear of which may deter from such sins as incur it. It is not morally expedient to minimize the force of such terms by disputing about the exact connotation of "aeonian." When we remember that the words are spoken by the loving and pitiful Saviour, we must allow that they point to some dreadful reality, the import of which he knew, and which he thus mercifully veiled from us as not able to bear the full revelation (see on Matthew 25:46). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
