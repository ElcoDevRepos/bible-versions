The crowds represent the diverse groups of people in Judea and Galilee, including Jews and Gentiles, who were drawn to Jesus' message. This setting highlights the widespread interest in Jesus' ministry and the spiritual hunger of the people. The crowds symbolize humanity's search for truth and guidance, reflecting the universal need for a Savior.<p><b>He was moved with compassion for them</b><br>The Greek word for "compassion" here is "splagchnizomai," indicating a deep, visceral empathy. This phrase underscores Jesus' divine nature, as He embodies God's love and mercy. Compassion is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, demonstrating His role as the Good Shepherd who cares for His flock. This compassion is not just emotional but leads to action, as seen in His healing and teaching.<p><b>because they were harassed and helpless</b><br>The people are described as "harassed and helpless," suggesting they were burdened by the religious leaders' legalism and the Roman occupation. This phrase reflects the spiritual oppression and lack of true guidance from the Pharisees and Sadducees, who failed to provide genuine spiritual leadership. The imagery evokes the struggles of the Israelites throughout history, often oppressed and in need of deliverance.<p><b>like sheep without a shepherd</b><br>This metaphor is rich in biblical symbolism. Sheep are dependent creatures, needing guidance and protection. The absence of a shepherd signifies a lack of leadership and care. In the Old Testament, leaders like Moses and David were seen as shepherds of Israel. Jesus fulfills the prophetic role of the ultimate Shepherd, as foretold in <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>, where God promises to set up one shepherd over His people. This phrase emphasizes Jesus' mission to guide, protect, and save His people, fulfilling the messianic prophecies and establishing His authority as the true Shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted as compassionate and caring, observing the needs of the people around Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>These are the people who followed Jesus, seeking healing, teaching, and guidance.
