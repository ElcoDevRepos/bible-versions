In the biblical context, loyalty to Jesus often led to persecution, and familial bonds were not immune to this strain. The early church faced such betrayals, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles, where believers were often handed over to authorities by their own kin. This echoes <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, which speaks of familial discord as a sign of societal breakdown. The prophecy of betrayal within families underscores the cost of discipleship and the radical nature of the Gospel, which can divide even the closest relationships.<p><b>and a father his child;</b><br>The mention of a father betraying his child emphasizes the extent of the division that the message of Christ can cause. In the ancient world, the family was the primary social unit, and loyalty to family was paramount. This betrayal signifies a reversal of expected roles and duties, highlighting the transformative and sometimes divisive power of the Gospel. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the end times, where natural affections would be disrupted (<a href="/2_timothy/3.htm">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>).<p><b>children will rise against their parents</b><br>This phrase indicates a generational conflict, where younger members of a family turn against their elders. In Jewish culture, honoring one's parents was a fundamental commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), making this prediction particularly shocking. It suggests a time of moral and social upheaval, where traditional values are overturned. This rising against parents can be seen as a metaphor for the rejection of old ways in favor of new beliefs, as the message of Christ challenges established norms.<p><b>and have them put to death.</b><br>The ultimate consequence of these betrayals is death, illustrating the severe persecution faced by early Christians. This phrase foreshadows the martyrdom that many believers would endure, as recorded in church history. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the potential cost of following Christ, where allegiance to Him may lead to the ultimate sacrifice. This echoes Jesus' own path to the cross and His call for His followers to take up their own crosses (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>), emphasizing the theme of suffering and sacrifice inherent in the Christian journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the persecution they will face as they spread the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all future followers of Christ who will face persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>The individuals mentioned in the prophecy, highlighting the deep personal betrayal that can occur even within families.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The event or series of events that Jesus is forewarning, where believers will face opposition, even from their own families.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The broader context in which these prophecies began to be fulfilled, as early Christians often faced persecution from their own communities and families.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/expect_persecution.htm">Expect Persecution</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we should not be surprised by opposition, even from those closest to us.

Observe that our Lord does not mention this until he has reminded them that they are connected by still deeper family ties with One above. The thought and partly the language of vers. 21, 22 comes in 4 Esdr. 6:24, 25, "Et erit in illo tempore debellabunt amici amicos ut inimici... et erit, omnis qui dcrelictus fuerit ex omnibus istis quibus praedixi tibi, ipse salvabitur et videbit salu-tare meum et finem saeculi mei.
