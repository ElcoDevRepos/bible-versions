Binding was a common practice for prisoners, signifying control and authority over the individual. In the context of Jesus, it reflects <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is described as being led like a lamb to the slaughter. The act of binding also highlights the irony of the situation, as the one who came to set captives free (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>) is Himself bound.<p><b>led Him away</b><br>This phrase suggests a transition from the Jewish authorities to the Roman authorities, marking a shift in the legal proceedings. The leading away of Jesus fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, which speaks of the servant being taken away by oppression and judgment. It also reflects the cultural and legal practices of the time, where a prisoner would be escorted by guards to ensure compliance and prevent escape. This movement from one place to another signifies the progression of Jesus' path to the crucifixion.<p><b>and handed Him over to Pilate the governor</b><br>Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea from AD 26 to 36. His involvement in the trial of Jesus is significant, as it fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed. Pilate's role as governor meant he had the authority to execute capital punishment, which the Jewish leaders lacked under Roman rule. This handing over to Pilate also underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' prediction in <a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>, where He foretold that He would be delivered to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. The involvement of a Roman official highlights the universal scope of Jesus' mission, as His death would not only be a Jewish affair but one that involved the entire world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being led away to face trial.

He must have belonged, by birth or adoption, to the <span class= "ital">gens</span> of the Pontii, one of whom, C. Pontius Telesinus, had been the leader of the Samnites in their second and third wars against Rome B.C. 321-292. The <span class= "ital">cognomen</span> Pilatus means "armed with the <span class= "ital">pilum</span> or javelin," and may have had its origin in some early military achievement. As applied, however, to Mount Pilatus in Switzerland, it has been conjectured that it is a contracted form of <span class= "ital">Pileatus,</span> from <span class= "ital">pilea</span> a cap, and is applied to the mountain as having for the most part, a cloud-capped summit. When Judaea became formally subject to the empire, on the deposition of Archelaus, a <span class= "ital">procurator,</span> or collector of revenue, invested with judicial power, was appointed to govern it, subject to the Governor of Syria (<a href="/luke/2-2.htm" title="(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)">Luke 2:2</a>), and resided commonly at Caesarea. Pontius Pilate, of whose previous career we know nothing, was appointed, A.D. 25-26, as the sixth holder of that office. His administration had already, prior to our Lord's trial, been marked by a series of outrages on Jewish feelings. (1) He had removed the head-quarters of his army from Caesarea to Jerusalem, and the troops brought their standards with the image of the emperor into the Holy City. The people were excited into frenzy, and rushed in crowds to Caesarea to implore him to spare them this outrage on their religion. After five days of obstinacy and a partial attempt to suppress the tumult, Pilate at last yielded (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 3, ?? 1, 2; <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> ii. 9, ?? 2-4). (2) He had hung up in his palace at Jerusalem gilt shields inscribed with the names of heathen deities, and would not remove them till an express order came from Tiberius (Philo, <span class= "ital">Leg. ad Caium,</span> c. 38). (3) He had taken money from the Corban, or treasury of the Temple, for the construction of an aqueduct. This led to another tumult, which was suppressed by the slaughter not of the rioters only, but also of casual spectators (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 9, ? 4). (4) Lastly, on some unknown occasion, he had slain some Galileans while they were in the very act of sacrificing (<a href="/luke/13-1.htm" title="There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.">Luke 13:1</a>), and this had probably caused the ill-feeling between him and the tetrarch Antipas mentioned in <a href="/luke/23-12.htm" title="And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.">Luke 23:12</a>. It is well to bear in mind these antecedents of the man, as notes of character, as we follow him through the series of vacillations which we now have to trace.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they had bound him.</span> With his hands tied by a rope behind his back. This was the treatment inflicted on condemned malefactors. During the actual official proceedings it was customary to release the accused person from bonds; hence this new binding was necessary. What passed in the council before this indignity was inflicted is, perhaps, told by St. Luke: the Sanhedrists satisfied themselves that they had a case against Jesus sufficient for their purpose, and they proceeded in a body to lay it before the governor. <span class="cmt_word">Pontius Pilate the governor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>). Some good manuscripts omit "Pontius," as in Mark and Luke; but there seems to be no doubt that he bore this <span class="accented">nomen gentilicium</span> (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44), which connected him with the Samnite <span class="accented">gens</span> of the Pontii. He was the sixth Roman Procurator of Judaea, and his title in Greek was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, which was a more general term for a commander or chief possessing more extensive powers. He held the office under the Prefect of Syria for ten years, at the end of which time he was removed for cruelty and extortion, and banished to Vienne, in Gaul, where he put an end to his own life. The turbulence and national animosity of the Jews had rendered it necessary to invest the procurator with the power of life and death, which he used in the most unscrupulous manner, so that he was universally hated and feared. The quarters of the Roman governor were called the Praetorium, and to this Christ was led. Pilate usually resided at Caesarea, but came to Jerusalem at the great festival, to be ready to quell any fanatical outbreak that might occur. So nowadays the Turks keep a body of troops in the same city to preserve the peace between Christian worshippers at Easter(!). Whether Pilate occupied the barracks at the fortress Antonia, or the magnificent palace of Herod, situated at the northwest angle of the upper city, is uncertain; but as we know that the Roman procurators did reside in Herod's palace, and as on this occasion Pilate was accompanied by his wife (ver. 19), it is most probable that he took up his abode in the latter, and that Jesus was brought before him there. Herod had a house of his own on the east of Zion, opposite the castle, which he seems to have occupied more often than his father's palace, thus leaving the latter at the pleasure of the Roman governors. Assuming this to be the case, Dr. Edersheim writes, "From the slope of the eastern angle, opposite the temple mount, where the palace of Caiaphas stood, up the narrow streets of the upper city, the melancholy procession wound to the portals of the grand palace of Herod. It is recorded that they who brought him would not themselves enter the portals of the palace, 'that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover'" ('Life and Times of Jesus,' 2:505). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They bound</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#275;santes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1210.htm">Strong's 1210: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind, tie, fasten; I impel, compel; I declare to be prohibited and unlawful.
