Jesus had just given His disciples a mission discourse, which is recorded in the previous chapter. This instruction included guidance on how to conduct their ministry, warnings about persecution, and encouragement to remain faithful. The number twelve is symbolic, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, indicating the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The disciples are being prepared to carry on Jesus' work, highlighting the importance of discipleship and the transmission of Jesus' teachings.<p><b>He went on from there</b><br>This indicates a transition in Jesus' ministry. Jesus often moved from place to place, reflecting the itinerant nature of His mission. This movement is significant as it shows Jesus' commitment to spreading His message widely and not being confined to one location. It also demonstrates His proactive approach in reaching out to different communities, fulfilling His role as the Good Shepherd who seeks out His sheep.<p><b>to teach and preach</b><br>Teaching and preaching were central to Jesus' ministry. Teaching involves explaining and interpreting the Scriptures, while preaching is proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom of God. Jesus' dual role as teacher and preacher underscores His authority and the transformative power of His message. This dual focus is seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus not only proclaims the coming of God's Kingdom but also provides instruction on how to live in accordance with God's will.<p><b>in their cities</b><br>The phrase "in their cities" refers to the towns and villages of Galilee, where many of the disciples were from. This highlights Jesus' strategy of starting His ministry in familiar territory, where His message could take root among those who knew Him and His disciples. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecy, as Galilee was a region prophesied to see a great light (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>). Jesus' presence in these cities signifies the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, as He brings the message of salvation to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who instructs His disciples and preaches the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/twelve_disciples.htm">Twelve Disciples</a></b><br>The chosen followers of Jesus, whom He instructs and sends out to continue His work.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/towns_of_galilee.htm">Towns of Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus conducted much of His ministry, known for its diverse population and as a fertile ground for His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_instruction.htm">The Importance of Instruction</a></b><br>Jesus' careful instruction of His disciples underscores the importance of preparation and understanding before undertaking ministry work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_ministry.htm">Active Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus' transition from instructing His disciples to actively teaching and preaching highlights the balance between learning and doing in the Christian life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/regional_focus.htm">Regional Focus</a></b><br>Jesus' focus on Galilee demonstrates the significance of starting ministry in familiar or local areas before expanding outward.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/model_of_leadership.htm">Model of Leadership</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies servant leadership by both teaching His disciples and personally engaging in ministry work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_of_mission.htm">Continuity of Mission</a></b><br>The passage illustrates the continuity of Jesus' mission, as He empowers His disciples to carry on His work while He continues to minister.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_11_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 11:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_1_Jesus_teaching_commitment.htm">How does Matthew 11:1 demonstrate Jesus' commitment to teaching and preaching?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jesus_city_ministry.htm">What can we learn from Jesus' example of ministering in "their cities"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_between_Matt_11_1_Great_Commission.htm">How does Matthew 11:1 connect to the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_spread_the_Gospel_like_Jesus.htm">In what ways can we follow Jesus' example of spreading the Gospel today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_11_1_inspire_evangelism.htm">How does Jesus' ministry in Matthew 11:1 inspire your personal evangelism efforts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_1_Jesus_mission_on_earth.htm">What does Matthew 11:1 reveal about Jesus' mission and purpose on earth?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_1_Jesus_ministry_shift.htm">How does Matthew 11:1 reflect the transition in Jesus' ministry?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_teach_in_cities_Matt_11_1.htm">Why did Jesus choose to teach and preach in the cities according to Matthew 11:1?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_john_recognize_jesus_post-baptism.htm">Did John the Baptist recognize Jesus after his baptism?

Matthew often marks turning points this way (see <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1).<p>- Jesus never leaves a task half-done; He fully equips before He deploys (compare <a href="/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>).<p>- The scene reminds us that divine instruction always precedes divine action&#8212;God first speaks, then sends (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His twelve disciples</b><p>- The focus is deliberately on &#8220;His&#8221; twelve (<a href="/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1-4</a>), underscoring relationship and authority.<p>- Twelve evokes the tribes of Israel, signaling that Jesus is forming a new covenant people (<a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>).<p>- Despite their limitations, these men become the foundation of the church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), demonstrating that Christ uses ordinary people for extraordinary purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went on from there</b><p>- Jesus is never idle; once the disciples are briefed, He moves (<a href="/mark/1-38.htm">Mark 1:38</a>; <a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>).<p>- The phrase shows mobility in ministry&#8212;obedience leads to motion, not stagnation (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<p>- It models for believers that instruction should translate into mission, not mere information (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to teach and preach</b><p>- Teaching clarifies truth; preaching calls for response (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; 9:35). Jesus does both, offering head knowledge and heart invitation.<p>- Kingdom proclamation remains central; miracles follow but never replace the Word (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>- The pairing validates every local church&#8217;s dual commitment to sound doctrine (<a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>) and evangelistic declaration (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in their cities</b><p>- &#8220;Their cities&#8221; refers to the Galilean towns where the Twelve lived and labored (<a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>; <a href="/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1</a>).<p>- Jesus ministers where people actually reside, illustrating incarnational presence (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/luke/8-1.htm">Luke 8:1</a>).<p>- By entering familiar streets, He dignifies everyday places as mission fields (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;Jerusalem&#8230; Judea&#8230; Samaria&#8230; the ends of the earth&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a> captures a seamless flow: Christ completes His briefing, affirms His bond with the Twelve, moves forward, continues His dual ministry of teaching and preaching, and does so in the disciples&#8217; home territory.
