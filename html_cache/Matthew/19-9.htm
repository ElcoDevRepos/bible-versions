In the context of <a href="/matthew/19.htm">Matthew 19</a>, Jesus is responding to questions from the Pharisees about the legality of divorce, referencing the Mosaic Law. His use of "I tell you" underscores His role as the ultimate interpreter of the Law, surpassing traditional interpretations.<p><b>that whoever divorces his wife</b><br>Divorce was a significant issue in Jewish society, with debates between different rabbinical schools, such as Hillel and Shammai, regarding its grounds. The phrase highlights the universality of Jesus' teaching, applying to all who consider divorce. It reflects the seriousness of the marital covenant, which was intended to be a lifelong commitment.<p><b>except for sexual immorality</b><br>This exception clause is crucial in understanding Jesus' teaching on divorce. The term "sexual immorality" translates from the Greek word "porneia," which encompasses various forms of illicit sexual behavior. This exception aligns with the Jewish understanding of marital unfaithfulness as a legitimate ground for divorce, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>.<p><b>and marries another woman</b><br>Remarriage after divorce was a common practice, but Jesus' teaching here introduces a moral dimension to the act. The cultural context of the time allowed for remarriage, but Jesus challenges His followers to consider the spiritual implications of such actions, emphasizing the sanctity of the original marriage bond.<p><b>commits adultery.</b><br>Adultery, a violation of the marital covenant, was a serious offense in Jewish law, punishable by death according to <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>. By equating remarriage after an illegitimate divorce with adultery, Jesus elevates the standard of marital fidelity. This teaching connects to the broader biblical theme of faithfulness, reflecting God's unwavering commitment to His people, as seen in the prophetic imagery of marriage in Hosea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing teaching on the sanctity of marriage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often challenged Jesus, including on matters of the law such as divorce.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were present during this teaching and often sought further clarification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The covenantal relationship between a man and a woman, which is the focus of Jesus' teaching here.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divorce.htm">Divorce</a></b><br>The legal dissolution of a marriage, which Jesus addresses with specific conditions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, intended to be a lifelong union.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exception_clause.htm">Exception Clause</a></b><br>Jesus provides an exception for divorce in the case of sexual immorality, highlighting the seriousness of marital fidelity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/adultery_and_remarriage.htm">Adultery and Remarriage</a></b><br>Remarrying after an unbiblical divorce is considered adultery, underscoring the gravity of breaking the marriage covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_faithfulness.htm">Call to Faithfulness</a></b><br>Believers are called to uphold the sanctity of marriage and strive for reconciliation and forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_love.htm">Reflecting Christ's Love</a></b><br>Marriages should reflect Christ's love and commitment to the Church, serving as a testimony to the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_19_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 19:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_19_9_on_divorce_grounds.htm">How does Matthew 19:9 define the grounds for biblical divorce and remarriage?

Earlier, He quoted <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> to show that marriage is God-made, not man-made. By prefacing His statement this way, He steps above the rabbinic debates of the day and speaks as the One who authored marriage (see <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a> for His unique authority).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; words carry the same weight as any Old Testament command (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48-50</a>).<p>&#8226; He is not merely offering advice; He is issuing a kingdom decree that binds the conscience of every disciple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whoever divorces his wife</b><p>&#8220;Whoever&#8221; widens the scope to every husband, regardless of culture or circumstance. Divorce is not a private contract but a public act with spiritual consequences (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>). Jesus speaks to husbands here, but <a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11-12</a> makes clear the principle applies equally to wives.<p>Remember:<p>&#8226; Marriage vows form a covenant that God Himself witnesses (<a href="/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s ideal remains lifelong faithfulness; divorce shatters a union He joined (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except for sexual immorality</b><p>This clause introduces the lone ground Jesus permits for breaking the marital covenant.

He affirms lifelong, covenant marriage, permits breakage only for sexual immorality, and warns that remarriage after an unlawful divorce equals adultery. These clear boundaries uphold God&#8217;s holiness while protecting the purity and permanence of the marital bond.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Whosoever shall put away his wife.</span>--The questions to which the law thus proclaimed gives rise have been discussed in the Note on <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>. One serious difference has, however, to be noticed. Where in the earlier form of the precept we read, "cuseth her (the woman put away for any cause but adultery) to commit adultery," we have here, more emphatically as bearing on the position of the husband in such a case, the statement that he by contracting another marriage "commits adultery." The utmost that the law of Christ allows in such a case is a divorce, <span class= "ital">a mensa et thoro,</span> not <span class= "ital">a vinculo.</span> The legislation which permits the complete divorce on other grounds, such as cruelty or desertion on either side, is justified, so far as it is justifiable at all, on the ground of the "hardness of heart" which makes such a concession necessary. It is interesting to compare St. Paul's treatment of cases which the letter of this command did not cover, in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10-15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I say unto you.</span> Our Lord here enunciates the law which was to obtain in his kingdom, which, indeed, was simply the reintroduction and enforcement of the primitive and natural ordinance. <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> it be <span class="cmt_word">for fornication;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: <span class="accented">nisi ob fornicationem</span> (Vulgate). This is the received reading. Tregelles, Tischendort; Westcott and Hort omit <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>. The parallel passage in St. Mark (where Christ is stated to have made the remark to his disciples "in the house") omits the clause altogether. Lachmann, following some few manuscripts, has introduced <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "saving for the cause of fornication," from <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>. The interpretation of this verse has given occasion to acute controversy. There are some questions that have to be considered in expounding this matter. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is here meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>? Does it bear its usual meaning, or is it equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "adultery"? These who affirm that the sin of married persons is never expressed by the word <span class="accented">porneia</span>, hold that it here signifies ante-nuptial unchastity, which would make the marriage void <span class="accented">ab initio</span>; post-nuptial transgression would be punished by death, not by divorce. In this view, our Lord would say that no divorce is allowable except where the wife is proved to have been unchaste before marriage. In such a case, the union being void from the first, the man is free to marry again. But there are difficulties in this interpretation. Why, at the end of the verse, is it called adultery to marry the divorced woman, if she was never really and lawfully married? Again, it is not correct to say that <span class="accented">porneia</span> denotes solely the sin of unmarried people. All illicit connection is described by this term, and it cannot be limited to one particular kind of transgression. In Ecclus. 23:23 it is used expressly of the sin of an adulteress. We may also remark that metaphorically idolatry is often called by this name, whereas, since Israel is supposed to be married to the Lord, the breaking of this bend by the worship of false gods might more strictly be named adultery. And yet again, there is no proof that the discovery of previous immorality in a wife did <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> vitiate the marriage (see <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, etc.). The passages that are thought to bear on this matter are <a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a> and Deuteronomy 24:1-4. In the former there is no question of divorce, - the offender is to be stoned; in the second passage the ground of divorce is "some uncleanness," or some unseemly thing, whether immorality or personal defect is meant cannot be decided, the rival schools taking different sides. But it is quite certain that adultery is not intended, and ante-nuptial unchastity is not even hinted. The interpretation, therefore, given above cannot be maintained. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Omitting for the moment the limiting clause, may we say that the general teaching of Christ makes for the indissolubility of the marriage bond? The majority of the Fathers from Hermas and Justin Martyr downwards affirm this. Those who admit that divorce is permissible in the case of the wife's adultery are unanimous in asserting that, by Christ's ordinance, remarriage is prohibited to the husband during the culprit's life; so that, practically, if divorce <span class="accented">a mensa et toro</span> is allowed, divorce <span class="accented">a vinculo is</span> refused. All Christ's utterances on the subject, saving the apparently restrictive clause (<a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>) and here, absolutely and plainly forbid divorce, on the ground of law and nature. The words in <a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11</a> and <a href="/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a> are given without any limitation whatever. St. Paul draws from such his conclusion of the indissolubility of the marriage tie, as may be seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10, 11, 39</a>; <a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 3</a>. There could never have been a doubt about this subject had it not been for the difficulty in interpreting the parenthetical clause. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Are we, then, to suppose that Christ, by those words, modifies his general statement, and allows absolute divorce in the case of a wife's misconduct? Such is the view taken by many theologians, and practically endorsed by the civil law of many countries. Neither the Roman nor the Anglican Churches support this laxity. Ecclesiastical and civil laws are here antagonistic. It is said that Christ allows the wronged party to marry again. If so, if the oneness of the parties is wholly destroyed by the sin of the woman, why is it not permitted to a man to marry a divorced woman? This cannot be called adultery unless she is still one flesh with her husband, although separated. We must argue from this that divorce in such a case does not destroy the <span class="accented">vinculum matrimonii</span>, the marriage bond. and if not under this circumstance, surely under no other; for any other ground must be always less serious than adultery. If the clause in question enunciated an exception to the absolute rule elsewhere given, Christ would seem to stultify himself, to give two opposite decisions, and to introduce uncertainty in a most important verdict. The principle on which he based his dictum would be overthrown, and his hearers might have accused him of inconsistency. The solution offered for this difficulty is this - that Christ is contemplating merely what we call judicial separation; he considers that no trivial cause justifies this, in fact, nothing but fornication, and that this modified divorce does not free the man so that he may marry again; he is bound by the Law as long as his wife lives. Our Lord seems to have introduced the exceptional clause in order to answer what were virtually two questions of the Pharisees, viz. whether it was lawful to "put away a wife for every cause," and whether, when a man had legally divorced his wife, he might marry again. To the former Christ replies that separation was allowable only in the case of fornication; in response to the second, he rules that even in that case remarriage was wholly barred. <span class="cmt_word">And whosoever marrieth her which is put away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, without the article); <span class="accented">her, when she is put away</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">a divorced woman</span>. The clause is wholly omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and some other manuscripts, and some modern editors, as Westcott and Hort. But it has very high authority in its favour. Alford renders, "her, when divorced," and restricts the application to a woman unlawfully divorced, not extending it to one separated for <span class="accented">porneia</span>. But the language is too indefinite to admit of this interpretation as certain (see <a href="/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>, and the note on Matthew 5:32, where the popular view is expressed). The clause, pondered without regard to foregone conclusions, surely contains an argument for the indissolubility of the marriage tie, as we have said above. Marriage with a divorced wife can be rightly termed adultery only in consideration of the continuance of the vinculum. <span class="cmt_word">Doth commit adultery.</span> The binding nature of marriage does not depend on the will or the acts of the persons, but on its primal character and institution. By the repeal of the Mosaic relaxation and the restoration of marriage to its original principle, Christ not only enforces the high dignity of this ordinance, but obviates many opportunities of wickedness, such, for instance, as collusion between husband and wife with a view to obtain freedom for marriage with others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
