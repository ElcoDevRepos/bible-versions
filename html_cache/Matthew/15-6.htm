This practice is rooted in Jewish tradition, where dedicating possessions to God was seen as a pious act. However, Jesus criticizes this misuse, highlighting the Pharisees' hypocrisy in allowing traditions to override God's commandments. The command to honor one's parents is deeply embedded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), emphasizing its importance in Jewish law and culture. By prioritizing tradition over this commandment, the Pharisees were undermining the very law they claimed to uphold.<p><b>Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</b><br>Here, Jesus condemns the Pharisees for elevating human traditions above divine commandments. The "word of God" refers to the Scriptures, which hold ultimate authority. By adhering to traditions that contradict God's commands, the Pharisees effectively render God's word void. This critique is consistent with Jesus' broader ministry, where He often challenges religious leaders for their legalism and lack of genuine faith. The tension between tradition and Scripture is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, where Paul warns against being taken captive by human traditions. Jesus' rebuke serves as a reminder of the primacy of God's word over human customs, a principle that resonates throughout biblical teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and scribes, challenging their adherence to human traditions over God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who are known for their strict adherence to Jewish law and traditions.

The last clause is not in the Greek; it is supplied by our translators, as it was in Coverdale's version, to complete the apodosis. There are various methods of translating the passage. Retaining <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> at the beginning of the sentence, some make these words the continuation of the gloss, "Whosoever shall say," etc., the apodosis being found in the sentence following. Others conceive an aposiopesis after "be profited by me," as if Christ refrained from pronouncing the hypocritical and indeed blasphemous words which completed the gloss. In this case the apodosis follows in ver. 6, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, <span class="accented">then such a one will not honour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>), etc. The words are best taken as put into the Pharisees' mouth in the sense, "The man under those circumstances shall not honour," etc.; he is free from the obligation of helping his parents. The form of the sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with the future verb) is prohibitory rather than predictive, and implies, "he is forbidden to honour." Christ thus sharply emphasizes the contradiction between God's Law and man's perversion thereof. St. Mark has, "Ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father." Thus; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> in the apodosis, removing the full stop before it in the Authorized Version.
