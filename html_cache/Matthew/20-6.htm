This timing emphasizes the urgency and unexpected nature of the landowner's actions. In biblical symbolism, the eleventh hour can represent the last opportunity for repentance and salvation, highlighting God's grace extended even at the last moment. This concept is echoed in the parable's broader message of God's kingdom, where the last can be first, and vice versa.<p><b>he went out and found still others standing around</b><br>The landowner's repeated trips to find laborers illustrate God's persistent pursuit of individuals to join His kingdom. The "others standing around" may symbolize those who have not yet found their purpose or calling in life. This reflects the biblical theme of God seeking the lost and offering them a place in His work, as seen in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>, where Jesus states His mission to seek and save the lost.<p><b>&#8216;Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?&#8217; he asked.</b><br>This question highlights the inactivity and potential waste of time by those not engaged in the vineyard work. Culturally, day laborers would gather in marketplaces hoping to be hired, and not being chosen could lead to shame and economic hardship. The question implies a call to action and purpose, resonating with the biblical call to be active in faith and service. It also reflects the urgency of responding to God's call, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>, which urges believers to make the most of every opportunity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and just, seeking laborers for His vineyard.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laborers.htm">Laborers</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or those called to work in God's kingdom.

While circumstances kept them unemployed earlier, the landowner&#8217;s presence removes every obstacle (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; For hearers, the verse presses the call to immediate obedience: &#8220;We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). Delay is no longer defensible when God Himself invites.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/20-6.htm">Matthew 20:6</a> portrays God as a seeking, gracious Master who offers purposeful labor in His vineyard until the very last hour.

The labourers who had been first hired were not enough. Is there not an implied suggestion that they were not labouring as zealously as they might have done? They were working on their contract for the day's wages. Those who were called last of all had the joy of feeling that their day was not lost; and that joy and their faith in the justice of their employer gave a fresh energy to their toil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eleventh hour;</span> the hour before sunset, say about 5 p.m., leaving only one hour for work, when it would be most unusual to engage labourers. <span class="cmt_word">Idle</span>. The word is omitted in some manuscripts. There is some reproach in the master's question. Where were they earlier in the day, when he was hiring labourers for his vineyard? Why were they not in the marketplace, like their comrades, looking out for employment? Such questions, like many, others in the parable, are left unanswered. We see from the universal use of the term, "the eleventh hour," to express the close of the day of grace, how widely has prevailed the interpretation of the parable which applies it to the various stages of the life of the individual.
