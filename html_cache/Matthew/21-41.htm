In the parable of the tenants, the "wretches" are the tenants who killed the landowner's servants and son. This is a direct reference to the religious leaders of Israel who rejected the prophets and Jesus. The concept of divine retribution is consistent with Old Testament themes, such as in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is depicted as a vineyard that fails to produce good fruit and faces judgment.<p><b>they replied,</b><br>The response comes from the listeners of Jesus' parable, likely the chief priests and Pharisees. Their answer unwittingly pronounces their own judgment, as they fail to see themselves in the story. This interaction highlights the blindness and hardness of heart that Jesus often confronted in the religious leaders.<p><b>and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants</b><br>This signifies the transfer of God's kingdom from Israel to a new people who will be faithful. The "other tenants" symbolize the Gentiles and the early Christian church, which would bear fruit for God's kingdom. This shift is echoed in passages like <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-24</a>, where Paul discusses the inclusion of the Gentiles into God's plan.<p><b>who will give him his share of the fruit at harvest time.</b><br>The expectation of fruitfulness is a recurring biblical theme, representing the righteous deeds and faithfulness expected from God's people. The "harvest time" alludes to the final judgment when God will assess the faithfulness of His people. This is consistent with the teachings of Jesus in other parables, such as the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where accountability and fruitfulness are emphasized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching in the temple courts, addressing the chief priests and Pharisees.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_pharisees.htm">Chief Priests and Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of Israel who are being indirectly addressed through the parable.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of Israel, God's chosen people, entrusted with His word and blessings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tenants.htm">Tenants</a></b><br>Represent the religious leaders who were supposed to lead Israel in faithfulness to God but failed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/owner_of_the_vineyard.htm">Owner of the Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents God, who expects faithfulness and fruitfulness from His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god.htm">Accountability to God</a></b><br>Just as the tenants were accountable to the vineyard owner, we are accountable to God for how we steward His gifts and calling.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_in_faith.htm">Fruitfulness in Faith</a></b><br>God expects His people to bear spiritual fruit.

On the assumption that those who gave the answer were the scribes and Pharisees, we may see in it either a real unconsciousness that they were as the men on whom the punishment was to fall (see Note on <a href="/matthew/21-31.htm" title="Whether of them two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.">Matthew 21:31</a>), or, more probably, an affected horror, by which they sought to disguise the conviction that the parable was meant for them. They would not admit, in the presence of the multitude, that they winced at this intimation that their designs were known.<p><span class= "bld">Those wicked men.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">those miserable men,</span> the adjective being the same as the preceding adverb. Their answer, like the speech of Caiaphas in <a href="/context/john/11-49.htm" title="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,">John 11:49-51</a>, was an unconscious prophecy, in which were wrapt up at once the destruction of the Holy City, and the transfer of the privileges that had belonged to Israel to the Gentile Church, which was to grow into Catholic Christendom. The Lord of the vineyard would not be robbed of its fruits, and sooner or later would find faithful and true labourers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They say unto him.</span> The Pharisees probably made the reply, not at the moment apprehending the sense of the parable. Or the words were spoken by some of the bystanders, and taken up and emphatically repeated by our Lord with an unmistakable application (ver. 43). The conclusion was a necessary consequence, and this will account for Mark and Luke apparently making them a part of Christ's speech. By their answer they blindly condemn themselves, as David did at hearing Nathan's parable (<a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will miserably</span> (<span class="greek_word">kakw = </span>) <span class="cmt_word">destroy those wicked men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">miserable men</span>); or, <span class="accented">he will evilly destroy those evil men</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Malos male perdet.</span> He will make their punishment equal their crime.

The clause is peculiar to Matthew. The speakers did not clearly apprehend the bearing of this detail of the parable. <span class="cmt_word">In their</span> <span class="cmt_word">seasons.</span> The times when the various fruits are ripe and ready for harvesting. These would vary in different climates and under differing circumstances; but the good husbandmen would be always ready to render to their Lord the fruits of faith and obedience, at every holy season and in due proportion. This parable, spoken originally of Israel, applies, like all such similitudes, to the Christian Church and to the human soul. How God dealt with individual Churches we see in his words to the seven Churches of Asia (<a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1-3</a>.). Ecclesiastical history furnishes similar examples throughout all ages. God gives privileges, and looks for results worthy of these graces. He sends warnings; he raises up apostles, preachers, evangelists; and if a Church is still unfaithful, he takes away his Spirit, and lets it lapse, and gives its inheritance to others, In the other case, the vineyard is the soul of man, which he has to cultivate for his Master's use. God has hedged it round with the law, external and internal, given it the ministry and sacraments and the Scripture, and looks to it to bring forth the fruits of obedience, service, worship. He sends times of visitation, teaching, warning; he speaks to it by secret inspiration; he calls it in loving tones to closer union. If it hearkens to the call, it walks in the way of salvation; if it refuses to hear, it casts away the hope of its calling, and must share the lot of Christ's enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;He will bring</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(apolesei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and the base of olethros; to destroy fully, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
