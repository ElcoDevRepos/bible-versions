The "talent" was a large sum of money, indicating significant responsibility. The servant's approach to the master reflects a culmination of the parable's narrative, emphasizing accountability. In biblical context, talents symbolize God-given gifts and responsibilities. The servant's actions contrast with the other two servants who invested their talents wisely.<p><b>&#8216;Master, I knew that you are a hard man,</b><br>The servant addresses the master with a perception of harshness, suggesting fear rather than love or respect. This reflects a misunderstanding of the master's character, which can be seen as a metaphor for a misunderstanding of God's nature. The term "hard man" implies strictness and severity, which may reflect cultural views of authority figures in ancient times. This perception affects the servant's actions and decisions.<p><b>reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.</b><br>This accusation implies that the master benefits from the labor of others, suggesting exploitation. In the cultural context of the time, landowners often reaped the benefits of their workers' labor, but the servant's statement may also reflect a skewed view of justice and fairness. Biblically, this can be seen as a misunderstanding of God's sovereignty and provision. The imagery of reaping and gathering is often used in scripture to describe God's judgment and the gathering of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>.

His single talent was still a significant sum, demonstrating the master&#8217;s generosity (cf. <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10&#8211;12</a>, where faithfulness in little reveals readiness for greater trust). The servant&#8217;s return, contrasted with the earlier servants&#8217; joyful reports, highlights his different heart posture. <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a> reminds that &#8220;each of us will give an account of himself to God,&#8221; and this verse sets the stage for that sober reckoning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came and said</b><p>Approaching the master, the servant immediately appeals to words rather than deeds. Instead of presenting profit, he offers excuses. <a href="/proverbs/26-16.htm">Proverbs 26:16</a> warns that a sluggard is &#8220;wise in his own eyes,&#8221; and this servant embodies that attitude&#8212;talking rather than producing. His speech will soon betray a distorted view of the master, echoing <a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12&#8211;13</a>, where blame-shifting replaces responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Master, I knew that you are a hard man</b><p>The servant claims intimate knowledge of the master&#8217;s character yet completely misreads him. Earlier servants experienced the same master as generous and rewarding (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21, 23</a>). <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a> states, &#8220;The LORD is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His deeds.&#8221; The servant&#8217;s accusation therefore reveals his own hardness, not the master&#8217;s. Like the unfaithful Israelites who called God harsh in <a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>, he projects his fear and laziness onto the master.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed</b><p>He portrays the master as one who expects results without investment, yet the parable shows the master did invest&#8212;he entrusted talents. <a href="/john/4-38.htm">John 4:38</a> illustrates a legitimate scenario where one reaps another&#8217;s labor, but here the servant twists that principle into a complaint. His words expose two errors:<p>&#8226; He forgets stewardship&#8212;the talents never belonged to him (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; He ignores previous evidence of the master&#8217;s fairness&#8212;rewards were given proportionally (<a href="/matthew/25-20.htm">Matthew 25:20&#8211;23</a>).<p>Rather than inspiring diligent service as it did in the other servants, knowledge of the master&#8217;s standards becomes for him an excuse for inactivity, mirroring <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> where faith without works is dead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-24.htm">Matthew 25:24</a> reveals a servant whose wrong view of his master fuels disobedience. By blaming the master&#8217;s alleged severity, he justifies burying his talent and shirks responsibility. Scripture consistently shows that a true understanding of God&#8217;s character propels faithful action, while a distorted view breeds fear and sloth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">I knew thee that thou art an hard man.</span>--The word "hard" points to stiffness of character--St. Luke's "austere," to harshness and bitterness. Was the plea an after-thought, put forward as an excuse for what had been originally sloth pure and simple? On that view, the lesson taught is that neglect of loyal service leads before long to disloyal thoughts. But it may have been our Lord's intention to represent the slothful servant as having all along cherished the thought which he now pleads in his defence. That had been at the root of his neglect. The eye sees only so far as it brings with it the power to see, and therefore he had never seen in his master either generous love or justice in rewarding. The proverb, "One soweth, another reapeth" (<a href="/john/4-37.htm" title="And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.">John 4:37</a>), taken on its darker and more worldly side, seemed to him the rule of his master's conduct. So in the souls of men there springs up at times the thought that all the anomalies of earthly rule are found in that of God, that He too is arbitrary, vindictive, pitiless, like earthly kings; and that thought, as it kills love, so it paralyses the energy which depends on love. So, we may believe, following the thought already thrown out, the heart of the Traitor was full of envy and bitterness because he stood so low in the company of the Twelve, and thought hardly of his Master because He thus dealt with him and yet looked for faithful service.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He which had received the</span> <span class="cmt_word">one talent.</span> The rest of the parable is concerned with the case of this unprofitable servant. Usually, those who have most privileges neglect or misuse them or some of them; here the man apparently least favoured is taken as the type of the useless and wicked disciple, because his task was easiest, his responsibility less, his neglect most inexcusable. He has heard the words of his two fellow servants, and the great reward which their faithful service has received; he comes with no joy and confidence to render his account; he feels fully how unsatisfactory it is, and beans at once to defend his conduct by proclaiming his view of his lord's character. <span class="cmt_word">I know thee that thou art an hard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man.</span> He chooses to conceive of his lord as harsh, stern, churlish in nature, one without love, who taxes men above their powers, and makes no allowance for imperfect service, however honest. He dares to call this impudent fiction knowledge. Thus men regard God, not as he is, but according to their own perverted views; they read their own character into their conception of him; as the Lord says, in <a href="/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>, "Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself." <span class="cmt_word">Reaping where thou hast not sown</span> (<span class="accented">thou sowedst not</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and gathering where thou hast not</span> <span class="cmt_word">strawed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">whence thou scatteredst not</span>). This is a proverbial saying, implying a desire of obtaining results without sufficient means. The last verb is interpreted either of sowing or winnowing; the latter seems to be correct here, thus avoiding tautology. It is used by the Septuagint in this sense in <a href="/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, as the rendering of the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">zarah</span> (Edersheim). So the phrase here signifies gathering corn from a floor where thou didst not winnow.
