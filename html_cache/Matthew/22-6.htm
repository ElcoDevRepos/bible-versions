In the context of the parable, the servants represent the prophets and messengers sent by God to Israel. Historically, Israel often rejected and persecuted prophets, as seen with figures like Jeremiah and Elijah. This reflects a broader biblical theme of resistance to divine messages, as seen in <a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>, where Stephen accuses the Jewish leaders of persecuting the prophets.<p><b>mistreated them</b><br>The mistreatment of the servants symbolizes the harsh treatment and suffering endured by God's messengers. This aligns with the experiences of many prophets who faced ridicule, imprisonment, and violence. The cultural context of the time often involved severe consequences for those who challenged religious or political authorities, as seen in the treatment of John the Baptist. This mistreatment foreshadows the suffering of Jesus and His followers, as He warned in <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a> that His disciples would face persecution.<p><b>and killed them</b><br>The killing of the servants underscores the ultimate rejection and violence against God's representatives. This reflects the historical reality of prophets like Zechariah, who was stoned to death, and anticipates the crucifixion of Jesus. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of martyrdom, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, which recounts the deaths of many faithful witnesses.
