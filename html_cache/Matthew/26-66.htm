The high priest, Caiaphas, is addressing the council after Jesus has been accused of blasphemy. This question is rhetorical, meant to prompt a unified response from the council. The Sanhedrin was composed of chief priests, elders, and scribes, who were the religious leaders of Israel. Their role was to interpret and enforce Jewish law, and they were seen as the highest authority in religious matters. This moment is significant as it reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;He deserves to die,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>The response of the Sanhedrin indicates their unanimous decision that Jesus is guilty of blasphemy, a crime punishable by death according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). This verdict is significant in the context of Jewish law and Roman occupation. While the Sanhedrin could pronounce a death sentence, they did not have the authority to carry it out under Roman rule, which is why they later bring Jesus to Pontius Pilate. This moment also highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His suffering and death (<a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>). Theologically, this decision is seen as part of God's sovereign plan for redemption, with Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being judged by the Sanhedrin in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council responsible for religious decisions, which is conducting the trial of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest_caiaphas.htm">High Priest Caiaphas</a></b><br>The high priest presiding over the trial, who questions Jesus and seeks a verdict.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this trial takes place, specifically in the high priest's palace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_accusation_of_blasphemy.htm">The Accusation of Blasphemy</a></b><br>The charge brought against Jesus, leading to the declaration that He deserves death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_charge_of_blasphemy.htm">Understanding the Charge of Blasphemy</a></b><br>Recognize the gravity of the accusation against Jesus and how it was used to fulfill God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_injustice_of_human_judgment.htm">The Injustice of Human Judgment</a></b><br>Reflect on the flawed human judgment that condemned Jesus and consider how we can seek justice in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Jesus' Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Appreciate how Jesus' trial and suffering were foretold in Scripture, affirming His identity as the Messiah.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_false_accusations.htm">Responding to False Accusations</a></b><br>Learn from Jesus' example of silence and composure in the face of false accusations and consider how we can emulate this in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_sanhedrin.htm">The Role of the Sanhedrin</a></b><br>Understand the historical and religious context of the Sanhedrin's authority and how it was misused in the trial of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_26_66_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 26:66?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matt_26_66_and_OT_prophecy_link.htm">How does Matthew 26:66 demonstrate the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leaders_justice_view_in_He_deserves_death.htm">What does "He deserves to die" reveal about the leaders' understanding of justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Prevent_unfair_judgments_today.htm">How can we guard against unjust judgments in our own communities today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_26_66_link_to_Jesus_Messiahship.htm">In what ways does Matthew 26:66 connect to Jesus' role as the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_false_accusations_4.htm">How should believers respond to false accusations, as seen in Matthew 26:66?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Sanhedrin_condemn_Jesus.htm">Why did the Sanhedrin condemn Jesus to death in Matthew 26:66?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Does_Matt_26_66_fulfill_OT_prophecy.htm">How does Matthew 26:66 reflect the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Sanhedrin_s_authority_to_judge_Jesus.htm">What legal authority did the Sanhedrin have to sentence Jesus in Matthew 26:66?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_26.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_spiritual_sacrifices.htm">What are the key events in Jesus' life timeline?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_plot_of_jesus_christ_superstar.htm">What is the plot of Jesus Christ Superstar?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/should_we_crucify_him.htm">Should we crucify him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'every_tribe_and_tongue'_mean.htm">What defines the faith of the Gospel?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 26:66 Mean</div><b>What do you think?</b><p>&#8211; The high priest has just torn his robes and declared Jesus&#8217; words to be blasphemy (<a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>). Now he turns to the ruling council and asks for their judgment.<p>&#8211; This question is not an invitation to open&#8208;minded discussion; it is a call for unanimous condemnation. The leadership had long been plotting Jesus&#8217; death (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47&#8211;50</a>).<p>&#8211; Their inquiry ignores the evidence of Jesus&#8217; sinless life and miraculous works (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>). Instead, it focuses on safeguarding their authority and traditions (<a href="/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture had foretold that rulers would conspire against the Lord&#8217;s Anointed (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), and this moment fulfills that prophecy in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He deserves to die</b><p>&#8211; The council pronounces the death sentence, claiming Jesus has committed blasphemy by affirming He is &#8220;the Christ, the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63&#8211;64</a>). Under Mosaic Law, blasphemy was punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), and they latch onto that statute.<p>&#8211; Yet their application is hypocritical. Jesus truly is the Son of God (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>), so His testimony cannot be blasphemy. Their verdict exposes willful unbelief rather than zeal for holiness (<a href="/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>; <a href="/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61&#8211;64</a>).<p>&#8211; By declaring &#8220;He deserves to die,&#8221; they are, in fact, affirming the very purpose for which Jesus came&#8212;to give His life as a ransom for many (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). God sovereignly uses their unjust sentence to accomplish redemption (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>; <a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They answered</b><p>&#8211; The plural reply reveals corporate agreement; no dissenting voice is recorded (<a href="/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>).

Yet through this unjust condemnation, God&#8217;s perfect plan for salvation moves forward exactly as foretold in Scripture, proving once more the Bible&#8217;s accuracy, reliability, and life-giving truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(66) <span class= "bld">He is guilty of death.</span>--In modern English the word "guilty" is almost always followed by the crime which a man has committed.

The decision, as far as the meeting went, was unanimous. Sentence was passed. It remained, however, to carry the sentence into effect, and this, while the Roman governor was at Jerusalem, presented a difficulty which had to be met by proceedings of another kind. The Jews, or at least their rulers, who courted the favour of Rome, ostentatiously disclaimed the power of punishing capital offences (<a href="/john/18-31.htm" title="Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law.

This detail, as they considered it, was now exclusively in the hands of the Romans. We see that this meeting, which virtually doomed Christ to death, was not a regular council of the Sanhedrin; for it was not held in the appointed chamber, and was conducted at night, when criminal processes were forbidden. The meeting next morning (<a href="/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>) was convened for the purpose of considering how this informal sentence should be executed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-66.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
