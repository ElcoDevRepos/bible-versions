His story begins in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>, where God calls him to leave his homeland and promises to make him a great nation. The birth of Isaac is significant as it fulfills God's promise to Abraham and Sarah, despite their old age, highlighting themes of faith and divine intervention. Isaac's birth is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking the continuation of God's covenant with Abraham's descendants. This lineage is crucial as it sets the stage for the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is a descendant of Abraham, fulfilling the promise that through Abraham's seed all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>).<p><b>Isaac the father of Jacob</b><br>Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah, is a patriarch whose life is detailed in Genesis. His role as the father of Jacob is significant in the continuation of the Abrahamic covenant. Isaac's life is marked by his near-sacrifice on Mount Moriah, a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice. Jacob, originally named by his parents, later becomes Israel, the father of the twelve tribes. The transition from Isaac to Jacob represents the passing of God's promises to the next generation. Jacob's story, including his vision of the ladder to heaven and his wrestling with God, underscores themes of struggle and divine blessing, which are central to the narrative of God's chosen people.<p><b>and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, had twelve sons who became the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel. Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah, is particularly significant as the tribe of Judah becomes the royal line from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descend. This lineage is prophesied in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where Jacob blesses Judah, stating that the scepter will not depart from him, indicating the future kingship and the coming of the Messiah. Judah's brothers, representing the other tribes, play crucial roles in the history of Israel, but it is through Judah that the promise of a savior is fulfilled. This genealogy emphasizes God's sovereign plan and the fulfillment of His promises through specific family lines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Known as the father of faith, Abraham is a central figure in the Bible.

Matthew signals that Jesus is the fulfillment of that universal blessing (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Abraham, Matthew roots the birth of Jesus in God&#8217;s everlasting covenant&#8212;one sealed by oath (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-18</a>) and reaffirmed as unbreakable (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaac&#8217;s birth itself was miraculous, arriving after decades of barrenness (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>); this foreshadows the later virgin birth of Jesus, reinforcing that God brings life where it is humanly impossible (<a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s obedient faith&#8212;&#8220;he believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; cf. <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>)&#8212;sets the pattern of justification by faith that culminates in those who trust Christ.<p>&#8226; Matthew&#8217;s first name therefore reminds readers that Jesus stands as the Seed promised to Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>), guaranteeing blessing for Jew and Gentile alike.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Isaac the father of Jacob</b><p>&#8220;Isaac the father of Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaac, the quiet patriarch who reopened his father&#8217;s wells and built his own altar (<a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18-25</a>), pictures steadfastness in the covenant line. God reaffirmed to him, &#8220;I will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s inclusion underscores grace: even before Jacob was born, God chose him over Esau (<a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>). The Messiah&#8217;s line flows through divine election rather than human merit.<p>&#8226; Jacob experienced transformation&#8212;from grasping heel-holder to &#8220;Israel&#8221; who wrestled with God and prevailed (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-28</a>). That change illustrates how God shapes flawed people for His redemptive purposes, a process completed in Christ (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The patriarchal trio&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob&#8212;anchors Jesus in the covenant formula &#8220;I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>), affirming that He is the living God who keeps His word across generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers</b><p>&#8220;Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming &#8220;Judah and his brothers,&#8221; Matthew calls to mind the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="/bsb/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>), signaling that Jesus embodies the hope of the entire nation, not just one clan.<p>&#8226; Judah, though fourth-born, received the promise of kingship: &#8220;The scepter will not depart from Judah&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Matthew points forward to Jesus as the prophesied King, &#8220;the Lion of the tribe of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s own story of failure and repentance (<a href="/bsb/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>; 44:18-34) showcases God&#8217;s ability to redeem sinners and weave broken stories into His perfect plan, climaxing in Christ who &#8220;came to call sinners&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-32.htm">Luke 5:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning &#8220;his brothers&#8221; reminds us that Jesus is not only Judah&#8217;s royal heir but also the One who gathers all Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/37-19.htm">Ezekiel 37:19-24</a>) and, by extension, all who will believe (<a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that salvation history moves through real families with real struggles, affirming the literal, historical nature of the genealogy and the reliability of Scripture (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-1.htm">1 Chronicles 2:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a> records three generations&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and then Judah and his brothers&#8212;to anchor Jesus firmly in God&#8217;s covenant story. Each name highlights a unique facet of God&#8217;s faithfulness: Abraham&#8217;s promised blessing, Isaac&#8217;s miracle of life, Jacob&#8217;s transforming grace, and Judah&#8217;s royal destiny that anticipates the Messiah. The verse assures us that the Lord keeps His word across centuries, weaving imperfect people into His perfect plan, and that in Jesus every promise finds its &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) The omission of the names of Ishmael and Esau is explained by the fact, that they were not only not in the line of succession, but were outside the covenant with Abraham--"In Isaac shall thy seed be called" (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm" title="And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your female slave; in all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.">Genesis 21:12</a>); and Esau had forfeited both the birth-right and the blessing. The brethren of Judah are named, on the other hand, because all who were descended from them had an equal interest in the Messiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abraham begat Isaac</span>. From Abraham to David the genealogy in St. Matthew agrees with that in <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. In the other two sections, from Solomon to Zerubbabel, and from Zerubbabel to Christ, there is some difficulty in accounting for the variations, which are considerable. The natural descent of each son from his father is emphasized by the repetition of the word "begat" at every stage (cf., however, ver. 8, note) till we come to Jesus, and then the phrase is varied, "Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">Judas</span> ( <span class="accented">Judah</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">and his brethren</span>. The addition of these words seems very natural here, because the twelve sons of Jacob were the fathers of the tribes of Israel, and as descended from Abraham were heirs of the promises; and although Judah was the tribe from which the Messiah was to spring, he was to be the glory of the whole of Israel. The same words, "and his brethren," are, however, found in ver. 11, where there is no such reason to account for them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Abraham</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#8048;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Abraam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_11.htm">Strong's 11: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham, progenitor of the Hebrew race.
