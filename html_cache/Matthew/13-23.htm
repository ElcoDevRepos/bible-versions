The "good soil" symbolizes a receptive and prepared heart, open to receiving the gospel. In biblical times, agriculture was a common occupation, and the audience would understand the importance of fertile soil for a successful harvest. This imagery emphasizes the necessity of spiritual readiness and openness to God's message.<p><b>is the one who hears the word and understands it.</b><br>Hearing the word implies exposure to the teachings of Jesus and the gospel message. Understanding goes beyond mere listening; it involves comprehending and internalizing the message. In the Jewish tradition, understanding is linked to wisdom and discernment, which are gifts from God. This phrase highlights the importance of not only hearing but also grasping the spiritual truths, leading to transformation and growth in faith.<p><b>He indeed bears fruit</b><br>Bearing fruit is a common biblical metaphor for demonstrating the results of a genuine faith. In the context of the New Testament, fruit often refers to the visible evidence of a believer's life, such as good works, character transformation, and the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). This phrase underscores the expectation that true understanding of the Word will manifest in a life that reflects God's kingdom values.<p><b>and produces a crop&#8212;a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.</b><br>The varying yields of the crop indicate the different levels of fruitfulness among believers. In ancient agriculture, a tenfold yield was considered a good harvest, so the numbers mentioned here suggest an extraordinary abundance. This reflects the supernatural work of God in the life of a believer, where the impact of the gospel can exceed natural expectations. The varying degrees of fruitfulness also acknowledge that while all believers are called to bear fruit, the extent can differ based on individual circumstances and God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about the Kingdom of Heaven through parables to His disciples and the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Represents anyone who spreads the Word of God, including Jesus Himself and His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seed.htm">The Seed</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Word of God, the message of the Kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_soil.htm">The Good Soil</a></b><br>Represents those who hear, understand, and accept the Word, leading to spiritual growth and fruitfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crop.htm">The Crop</a></b><br>The result of the Word taking root in good soil, symbolizing the spiritual fruit and impact of a believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_word.htm">Understanding the Word</a></b><br>True understanding of God's Word goes beyond mere hearing; it involves comprehension and application in one's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_as_evidence.htm">Fruitfulness as Evidence</a></b><br>The evidence of genuine faith and understanding is seen in the fruit produced in a believer's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_in_yield.htm">Diversity in Yield</a></b><br>Not all believers will produce the same amount of fruit, but all are called to be fruitful in their unique capacity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_of_the_heart.htm">Preparation of the Heart</a></b><br>Just as soil must be prepared to receive seed, our hearts must be ready to receive and nurture the Word of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_growth.htm">Perseverance in Growth</a></b><br>Spiritual growth and fruitfulness require ongoing commitment and perseverance in faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_make_our_hearts_fertile_for_God.htm">How can we ensure our hearts are "good soil" for God's Word?

He takes it in, discerns its meaning. The phrases in the other Gospels express the same thing, "hear the word and receive it<span class= "ital">"</span> (Mark), "in an honest and good heart" hear and retain it (Luke). Even here, however, there are different degrees of the holiness which is symbolised by "bearing fruit"--"some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty"--varying according to men's capacities and opportunities.<p>It is allowable to fill up the outline-sketch of interpretation which thus formed the first lesson in this method in the great Master's school. (1.) It may seem strange at first that the disciples were not told who in the work of the kingdom answered to "the Sower" of the parable. The interpretation is given in the parable of the Tares ("the Sower of the good seed is the Son of Man"), and, in part, it may be said that this was the one point on which the disciples were not likely to misunderstand Him; but in part also, we may believe, this explanation was not given, because, though the parable was true in the first instance of Him and of His work, He meant them to learn wisdom from it for their own work. True, they were reaping what they had not sown (<a href="/john/4-38.htm" title="I sent you to reap that where on you bestowed no labor: other men labored, and you are entered into their labors.">John 4:38</a>), yet they too were in their turn to be sowers as well as reapers. (2.) It is obviously one important lesson of the parable that it teaches us to recognise the possible existence of "an honest and good heart" (the first word meaning "noble," "generous," rather than "honest" in our modern sense) prior to the preaching of the word. Such characters were to be found in those living under the Law, or without the Law (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a>), and it was the work of the preacher to look out for them, and win them to something yet higher. What made the ground good, is a question which the parable was perhaps meant to suggest, but does not answer. Theologians may speak of "prevenient grace." The language of <a href="/context/john/4-37.htm" title="And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.">John 4:37-38</a> leads us to think of the work of "the Light that lighteth every man." Here also the law holds good that "to him that hath shall more be given." (3.) It lies in the nature of such a parable that it represents the phenomena of the spiritual life only partially. It brings before us four classes of hearers, and seems to assume that their characters are fixed, incapable of change, issuing in results which might have been foreseen. But if so, then the work of the "word" thus preached would seem to be limited to order and progress, and the idea of "conversion"--the change of character--would almost be excluded. We must therefore supplement the parable in its practical application. The soil may be improved; the way-side and the stony places and that which contained the thorns may become as the good ground. It is the work of every preacher and teacher to prepare the soil as well as to sow the seed. In the words of an old prophet, which might almost seem to have suggested the parable itself, they are to "break up the fallow ground and sow not among thorns" (<a href="/jeremiah/4-3.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.">Jeremiah 4:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which also;</span> <span class="accented">who verily</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>), the particle giving exactness, to the relative (see Dr. Moulton's note at the end of Winer, &sect; 53). <span class="cmt_word">Some;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (Westcott and Hort).

"100 longius absunt a 60, quam 60 a 30. Habenti dabitur" (Bengel). The reason of the difference in the produce of the good ground is not stated, but, according to the tenor of the whole passage since ver. 3. this lay in a difference already existing within this good ground. Into the question of the <span class="accented">ultimate</span> cause of some men being in a better state of preparedness to receive Divine truths than others, our Lord does not enter. Prevenient grace is not always to be insisted upon in practical exhortation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the [seed]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
