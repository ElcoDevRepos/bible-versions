The disciples often sought clarification from Jesus, showing their role as learners. This setting highlights the importance of direct communication with Christ, a model for prayer and seeking understanding.<p><b>&#8220;Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended</b><br>The Pharisees were a prominent religious group in Jewish society, known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions. Their offense at Jesus' teachings reflects the tension between Jesus' message and the established religious norms. This moment underscores the growing conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. The Pharisees' offense also illustrates the challenge of confronting deeply held beliefs with the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>when they heard this?&#8221;</b><br>The specific teaching that offended the Pharisees was Jesus' statement about what defiles a person, emphasizing internal purity over external rituals. This teaching challenged the Pharisaic focus on ceremonial cleanliness and dietary laws. The reaction of the Pharisees is a reminder of the resistance that often accompanies transformative truth. This moment foreshadows the increasing opposition Jesus would face, ultimately leading to His crucifixion.

Even the disciples were half perplexed at the teaching itself, half afraid of what might be its immediate consequences.
