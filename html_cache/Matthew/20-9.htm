This phrase highlights the unexpected nature of the landowner's generosity, as these workers were hired at the last possible moment. Theologically, this can be seen as a representation of God's grace, which is extended to all, regardless of when they come to faith. This concept is echoed in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the father's love is lavishly given to the repentant son despite his late return.<p><b>came and each received a denarius</b><br>A denarius was a common day's wage for a laborer during the time of Jesus, as seen in other biblical references such as <a href="/matthew/22-19.htm">Matthew 22:19</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>. The payment of a full day's wage to those who worked only one hour underscores the theme of divine grace and the kingdom of heaven's values, which often subvert human expectations of fairness and merit. This act of generosity by the landowner can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where salvation is offered equally to all, regardless of their past or the timing of their conversion.

The idleness of the labourers had been no fault of theirs, and the readiness with which they came at the eleventh hour implied that they would have come as readily had they been called at daybreak, and therefore they received a full day's wages for their fraction of a day's work. The standard of payment was qualitative, not quantitative. In the interpretation of the parable, the "penny," as before, represents the eternal life of the kingdom of heaven. No true labourer could receive less; the longest life of labour could claim no more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They received every man a penny.</span> The steward, of course, was acting according to his master's instructions (though nothing is said of any previous orders on the subject) when he thus bounteously remunerated those that had been hired at the eleventh hour. Some commentators have endeavoured to show that the "penny" allotted to each set differed greatly in value; but this is an unwarrantable conjecture, and it is indispensable to the purport of the parable that the wages should be alike to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The workers who were hired]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
