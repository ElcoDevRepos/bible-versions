The "house of God" signifies a sacred space where God's presence dwelt among His people. In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-6</a>, David entered the tabernacle at Nob, seeking refuge and sustenance. This act foreshadows Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the temple, as He embodies God's presence on earth (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>and he and his companions</b><br>David was not alone; he was accompanied by his men, who were also in need. This highlights the communal aspect of their need and the shared experience of seeking God's provision. It parallels the New Testament community of believers who rely on Christ for spiritual sustenance and support one another in faith (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<p><b>ate the consecrated bread</b><br>The consecrated bread, also known as the "showbread" or "bread of the Presence," was placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle as an offering to God (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>). It was a symbol of God's provision and covenant with Israel. By eating this bread, David and his men were sustained physically, pointing to Jesus as the Bread of Life who sustains believers spiritually (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>which was not lawful for them to eat</b><br>According to Levitical law, the consecrated bread was reserved exclusively for the priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). This restriction underscores the holiness of the bread and the sanctity of God's commands. However, David's actions demonstrate that human need can take precedence over ceremonial law, a principle Jesus emphasizes in His ministry (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<p><b>but only for the priests</b><br>The priests, as mediators between God and the people, were the only ones permitted to eat the consecrated bread. This restriction highlights the priestly role in maintaining the holiness of the tabernacle. In the New Testament, Jesus is our High Priest, who mediates a new covenant and grants believers access to God's presence (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who was fleeing from King Saul at the time of this event.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_god.htm">House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the tabernacle, the sacred place where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecrated_bread.htm">Consecrated Bread</a></b><br>Also known as the "showbread" or "bread of the Presence," these were twelve loaves placed weekly in the tabernacle as an offering to God, meant only for the priests to eat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, tasked with performing the rituals and sacrifices in the tabernacle and later the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/companions_of_david.htm">Companions of David</a></b><br>Those who were with David during his flight from Saul, sharing in his hardships and needs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_mercy_over_ritual.htm">Understanding God's Mercy Over Ritual</a></b><br>Jesus uses this example to illustrate that human need can take precedence over ritual law.

Jesus cites this historical precedent to vindicate His disciples and to reveal His own authority as Lord of both temple and Sabbath. The passage affirms Scripture&#8217;s literal accuracy while highlighting the compassionate heart of God, who values life, mercy, and His Son&#8217;s sovereignty above mere ritual compliance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">How he entered into the house of God.</span>--Strictly speaking, it was in the tabernacle at Nob, where Ahimelech (possibly assisted by Abiathar, <a href="/mark/2-26.htm" title="How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?">Mark 2:26</a>) was ministering as high priest (<a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm" title="So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.">1Samuel 21:6</a>).

The necessity of the case, however, was in this instance allowed to override the ceremonial ordinance, and our Lord teaches men through that single instance to see the general principle that when positive commands and necessities involving the good of man come into collision, the latter, not the former, must prevail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How he entered into the house of God,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and did eat;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and they did eat</span>, with Revised Version margin (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), the simple plural verb laying the action less at David's door than does the phrase in the parallel passages - "and he gave" them to eat.
