The Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in Israel, was a central location for much of Jesus' ministry. Crossing to the other side often involved moving from predominantly Jewish regions to areas with more Gentile populations, highlighting the expanding reach of Jesus' ministry. This movement can symbolize the transition from the old covenant to the new, where the message of the Gospel would reach beyond the Jewish people to all nations.<p><b>the disciples forgot to take bread</b><br>The mention of bread is significant in the context of Jesus' recent miracles, such as the feeding of the 5,000 and the 4,000, where He multiplied loaves to feed large crowds. Bread in biblical times was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and life. The disciples' forgetfulness may indicate their lack of understanding or faith, despite witnessing Jesus' miraculous provision. This sets the stage for Jesus' teaching on spiritual discernment and the importance of focusing on spiritual nourishment over physical needs. The theme of bread also connects to Jesus as the "Bread of Life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), emphasizing His role as the provider of spiritual sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is leading and teaching His disciples throughout the Gospels.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles.

Boarding the boat (<a href="/mark/8-13.htm">Mark 8:13</a>), He physically removes the disciples from religious skeptics, modeling the wisdom of stepping away from unbelief to gain clarity.<p>&#8226; Similar movements across the Sea of Galilee mark turning points in the ministry of Christ (<a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>; <a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35</a>).

It represents a shift from confrontation to instruction. By relocating, Jesus prepares the disciples for a lesson free from the immediate pressure of hostile crowds (cf. <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Crossing water often prefaces divine provision&#8212;think of Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>) or Elijah at the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8</a>).

Miracles can quickly fade from memory when daily concerns intrude.<p>&#8226; Forgetfulness is a recurring human weakness: <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a> warns Israel not to forget the Lord&#8217;s acts; <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a> notes how their ancestors &#8220;forgot what He had done.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; memory gap sets up Jesus&#8217; gentle rebuke in verses 8&#8211;10, where He reminds them of the baskets of leftovers&#8212;evidence that material lack is no threat when He is present.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to take bread</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/16-5.htm">Matthew 16:5</a>b: &#8220;&#8230;to take bread.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Physical bread is absent, yet the Bread of Life is in the boat (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).

The contrast between literal bread and corrupt spiritual &#8220;leaven&#8221; underscores priorities&#8212;inner belief over outward supplies.<p>&#8226; Past abundance should have bolstered faith: five loaves fed five thousand with twelve baskets left over (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17&#8211;21</a>); seven loaves fed four thousand with seven baskets left over (<a href="/matthew/15-34.htm">Matthew 15:34&#8211;38</a>).

The verse positions the disciples between the memory of miraculous provision and the impending warning against poisonous doctrine. Their forgetfulness mirrors our own tendency to focus on visible lack rather than the Lord&#8217;s sufficiency. By highlighting their lapse, Scripture invites us to carry past proofs of God&#8217;s faithfulness into present moments of need, trusting that the One who multiplies loaves still sits with us &#8220;on the other side.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They had forgotten.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">they forgot.</span> St. Mark, with his usual precision in detail, states that they had but "one loaf" with them. Either the suddenness of their Lord's departure had deprived them of their customary forethought, or, it may be, they were beginning to depend wrongly on the wonder-working power, as though it would be used, not as before, to supply the wants of the famished multitude, but as rendering that forethought needless for themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-12.</span> - <span class="accented">Warning against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> (<a href="/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14-21</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They had forgotten</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not pluperfect); <span class="accented">came to the other side, and forgot</span>; <span class="accented">obliti sunt</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they perceived that they had forgotten to take sufficient bread for the journey before them. The district which they were about to traverse was but sparsely inhabited, and offered no hope of supplying this want. It is doubted whether the ensuing conversation took place during the voyage or after they had landed. The language of St. Mark inclines one to believe that the deficiency was discovered during the transit, and the remarks now narrated were made then. As it would take some hours to cross, there was ample time to feel and expatiate upon the need; and if Christ had told them of his future movements, they would naturally feel regret for their carelessness and want of forethought. Or it might be that Christ's observation concerning the leaven was made in the beat, and his reproof of their thoughts was given on landing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they crossed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(elthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
