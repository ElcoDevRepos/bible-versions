This moment occurs after Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane, highlighting Peter's internal conflict. His distance can symbolize the spiritual separation that fear and doubt create. This act fulfills Jesus' earlier prediction that Peter would deny Him (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>). The distance also reflects the physical and emotional space between Peter and Jesus, a precursor to his eventual denial.<p><b>right up to the courtyard of the high priest</b><br>The high priest's courtyard was part of a larger complex, likely belonging to Caiaphas, the high priest at the time. This location is significant as it was the center of Jewish religious authority. Archaeological findings suggest that such courtyards were open spaces surrounded by rooms, where trials and gatherings could occur. Peter's presence here indicates his desire to remain close to Jesus, despite the risk of being associated with Him.<p><b>And he went in and sat down with the guards</b><br>Peter's action of sitting with the guards shows his attempt to blend in and avoid detection. The guards were likely temple guards, responsible for maintaining order and executing the Sanhedrin's decisions. This setting underscores the tension and danger Peter faced, as he was surrounded by those who opposed Jesus. His choice to sit with them reflects his internal struggle between fear and faith.<p><b>to see the outcome</b><br>Peter's motivation to see the outcome reveals his uncertainty and curiosity about Jesus' fate. This phrase indicates a passive stance, as Peter is not actively intervening but observing. It highlights the human tendency to seek understanding and resolution in times of crisis. This moment foreshadows Peter's denial, as his fear of the outcome ultimately leads him to distance himself further from Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later for his denial of Jesus.

It was, we may believe, more than a vague curiosity.
