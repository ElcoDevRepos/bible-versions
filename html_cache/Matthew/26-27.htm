This act is deeply rooted in Jewish Passover traditions, where wine is consumed as part of the Seder meal. The cup symbolizes the blood of Christ, which will be shed for the forgiveness of sins. This moment foreshadows Jesus' sacrificial death and the establishment of a new covenant between God and humanity, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<p><b>gave thanks</b><br>The act of giving thanks, or "Eucharisteo" in Greek, is significant as it reflects Jesus' gratitude and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, even in the face of impending suffering. This thanksgiving is a model for believers, emphasizing gratitude in all circumstances. It also connects to the Jewish tradition of blessing God before partaking in food and drink, highlighting the continuity between the Old and New Covenants.<p><b>and gave it to them</b><br>By distributing the cup to His disciples, Jesus includes them in the new covenant. This act signifies the communal aspect of the faith, where believers are united in Christ's sacrifice. It also prefigures the practice of Communion or the Lord's Supper, a central rite in Christian worship that commemorates Jesus' death and resurrection.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Drink from it, all of you.</b><br>Jesus' instruction to "drink from it, all of you" emphasizes the inclusivity of His sacrifice. It is a call to all believers to partake in the benefits of His atoning death. This phrase underscores the universal offer of salvation through Christ, breaking down barriers of ethnicity, status, and gender, as echoed in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.

In the later ritual of the Passover, the cup of wine (or rather, of wine mingled with water) was passed round three times in the course of the supper. One such cup had been passed round early in the evening (<a href="/luke/22-17.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:">Luke 22:17</a>); now another becomes, under a solemn consecration, the symbol of a diviner truth than had yet been revealed to the listening and wondering disciples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He took the cup</span>. Many good manuscripts have "a cup," and some modern editors omit the article; but this cup was the only one on the table at the time; so the reading matters not. This was probably the third cup at the close of the Paschal meal (see on ver. 21). The wine of the country is what we call a red wine (compare "the blood of grapes," <a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>); it was mixed with a little water when used at the table. This third cup was termed "the cup of blessing" (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>), because over it was spoken a special benediction, and it was regarded as the principal cup, following, as it did, the eating of the lamb. <span class="cmt_word">Gave thanks</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The thanksgiving was a blessing (see on ver. 26). The celebration of Christ's death and the remembrance of the incalculable blessings obtained thereby may well be termed the Holy Eucharist, the great sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) it <span class="cmt_word">to them.</span> The aorist here used would imply strictly that he gave the cup once for all, herein differentiating the action from that employed in distributing the bread. St. Luke's expression, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves," refers to an earlier stage of the supper. In the present connection he nearly agrees with the other synoptists. It is possible that the cup was passed from hand to hand after it had been blessed by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Drink ye all of it.</span> St Mark adds, "And they all drank of it." Strange it is that, with these words written in the Scripture, any Church should have the hardihood to deny the cup to any qualified Christian. The Romanist's assertion that the cup is for priests alone, as it was given to the apostles only, and was destined for them and their sacerdotal successors, would apply equally to the consecrated bread, and then what becomes of the <span class="accented">general</span> use of the ordinance? If we would have life in us, we must not only eat Christ's flesh, but drink his blood. We need to be refreshed as well as strengthened in the battle of life, and it may well be that the mutilation of the sacrament carries with it spiritual effects that impede the soul's health. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He took</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#946;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(lab&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] cup,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#964;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pot&#275;rion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4221.htm">Strong's 4221: </a> </span><span class="str2">A drinking cup, the contents of the cup; fig: the portion which God allots. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave thanks</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eucharist&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2168.htm">Strong's 2168: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eucharistos; to be grateful, i.e. to express gratitude; specially, to say grace at a meal.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] gave [it]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ed&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
