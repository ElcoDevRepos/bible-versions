Such an assembly on the night of the Paschal Supper must have been still more at variance with usage, and the fact that it was so held has, indeed, been urged as a proof that the Last Supper was not properly the Passover. The present gathering was therefore an informal one--probably a packed meeting of those who were parties to the plot, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, and probably not a few others, like the young "ruler" of <a href="/luke/18-18.htm" title="And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 18:18</a>, not being summoned. When they had gone through their mock trial, and day was dawning (<a href="/luke/22-68.htm" title="And if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.">Luke 22:68</a>), they transformed themselves into a formal court, and proceeded to pass judgment. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 57-68.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus before Caiaphas, informally condemned to death.</span> (<a href="/mark/14-53.htm">Mark 14:53-65</a>; <a href="/luke/22-54.htm">Luke 22:54, 63-65</a>; <a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Led him away to Caiaphas.</span> The synoptists omit all mention of the preliminary inquiry before Annas (<a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13, 19-24</a>).

What passed before him is not recorded, none of the disciples being present at the examination.
