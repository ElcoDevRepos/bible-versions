Joseph&#8217;s decision shows courage and faith, fulfilling what Mark notes: &#8220;Joseph&#8230; took courage and went in to Pilate&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>).<p>&#8226; His action also aligns with Old Testament law that required prompt burial (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>), preventing the body from hanging overnight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to ask for the body of Jesus</b><p>&#8226; Roman custom often left bodies to decay on crosses or be thrown into common graves. Joseph requests Jesus&#8217; body so He may receive an honorable burial, displaying devotion and reverence.<p>&#8226; The request fulfills prophecy: &#8220;His grave was assigned with the wicked, but He was with a rich man in His death&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). Joseph, a wealthy man (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>), provides the tomb, literally satisfying Isaiah&#8217;s words.<p>&#8226; This moment also anticipates the resurrection. A known tomb, hewn from rock and sealed (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60-66</a>), becomes incontrovertible evidence when it is later found empty (<a href="/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Pilate ordered that it be given to him</b><p>&#8226; Pilate first verifies death through the centurion (<a href="/mark/15-44.htm">Mark 15:44-45</a>).

Each detail underscores fulfilled prophecy, authenticates Jesus&#8217; actual death, secures a dignified burial, and prepares the stage for the empty tomb. The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s redemptive plan unfolds even through unexpected people and secular authorities, confirming both the reliability of Scripture and the certainty of Christ&#8217;s resurrection hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(58) <span class= "bld">He went to Pilate.</span>--Assuming the death of our Lord to have been soon after the ninth hour (3 P.M.), Joseph would seem to have hastened at once to the Praetorium, and asked Pilate's permission to inter the body. St. Mark records Pilate's wonder that death should have come so soon (<a href="/mark/15-44.htm" title="And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.">Mark 15:44</a>). In his compliance with the petition we trace, as before, a lingering reverence and admiration. As far as he can, he will help the friends and not the foes of the righteous Sufferer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went to Pilate.</span> St. Mark says, "came and went in boldly unto Pilate." He had hitherto been a disciple of Christ, "secretly for fear of the Jews" (<a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a>); now that Christ was dead, and his death accompanied with such manifest wonders, according absolutely with ancient prophecy, and fulfilling Christ's own predictions, he hesitated no longer, he openly professed his partisanship, and threw in his lot with the Crucified. If from expediency or pusillanimity he had refrained from taking a prominent position as a favourer of this wonderful Teacher, he had lately learned a new lesson, and hailed the opportunity of publicly honouring him deceased whom in his heart he had loved and reverenced while alive. So he went to the Praetorium to see the procurator, whose sanction was required for removing the body of a criminal from the cross. It was probably after the deputation of the Jews to Pilate, mentioned by St. John (<a href="/john/19-31.htm">John 19:31</a>), that Joseph had his interview. <span class="cmt_word">Begged the body of Jesus.</span> It was not unusual for friends to obtain leave to pay the last rites and to give decent sepulture in such cases; otherwise the corpses were thrown carelessly into nameless graves, if they were not left to rot on the cross. The indignities which Christ had suffered during life now began to be reversed. <span class="cmt_word">Commanded the body to be delivered.</span> Pilate first, we are told, sent for the officer in charge of the execution, and finding from him that Jesus was really dead, granted Joseph's request. Perhaps he desired at the same time to flout the chief priests, and likewise to make some slight reparation to the innocent Victim of his policy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-58.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proselth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilat&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
