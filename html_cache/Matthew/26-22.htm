This emotional response indicates their genuine love and concern for Jesus, highlighting the human aspect of the disciples. The Greek word used here for "grieved" suggests intense sorrow, similar to the grief experienced in times of mourning. This moment foreshadows the sorrow of Jesus' impending crucifixion and the disciples' eventual understanding of His sacrifice.<p><b>and began to ask Him one after another</b><br>The phrase "one after another" suggests a sense of urgency and personal concern among the disciples. Each disciple's questioning indicates their introspection and fear of being the betrayer. This scene underscores the communal aspect of the Last Supper, where the disciples are gathered closely with Jesus, sharing in the Passover meal. The setting is significant, as it takes place in Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish worship and prophecy, during the Passover, a time commemorating deliverance from Egypt, which parallels Jesus' role as the ultimate deliverer.<p><b>&#8220;Surely not I, Lord?&#8221;</b><br>The use of "Lord" signifies the disciples' recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity. Their question, "Surely not I," reveals their uncertainty and self-doubt, reflecting the human tendency to question one's own faithfulness. This moment is a poignant reminder of human frailty and the need for divine grace. The disciples' questioning can be contrasted with Judas Iscariot's later betrayal, highlighting the theme of loyalty versus treachery. This phrase also connects to prophetic themes, as Jesus' betrayal was foretold in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend, pointing to the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is at the Last Supper with His disciples, preparing them for His impending betrayal and crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve men chosen by Jesus to follow Him and learn from His teachings.

All this passed apparently as a by-play, unheard or unheeded by the other disciples. It was followed by the hands of the Master and the Traitor meeting in the dish (probably that which contained the conserve of fruit above referred to); and dipping a piece of the unleavened bread in the syrup, the One gave it to the other.

Thus his peculations passed unnoticed, and the greed and. avarice which wrecked his spiritual life were entirely unsuspected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They were deeply grieved</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#965;&#960;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(lypoumenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3076.htm">Strong's 3076: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pain, grieve, vex.
