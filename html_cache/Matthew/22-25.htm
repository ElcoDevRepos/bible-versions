The number seven is often symbolic in the Bible, representing completeness or perfection. The Sadducees use this number to emphasize the extremity of their example. The setting is a public discussion, likely in the temple courts, where Jesus often taught.<p><b>The first one married and died without having children.</b><br>In Jewish culture, marriage was a significant covenant, and having children was seen as a blessing and a way to continue one's lineage. The mention of dying without children highlights the importance of offspring in Jewish society, as children were considered a means of preserving one's name and inheritance. This situation sets the stage for the application of the levirate marriage law.<p><b>So he left his wife to his brother.</b><br>This refers to the practice of levirate marriage, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>. According to this law, if a man died without having children, his brother was to marry the widow to produce offspring in the deceased brother's name. This practice was intended to ensure the continuation of the family line and to provide for the widow. The Sadducees use this law to challenge Jesus on the concept of resurrection, which they did not believe in, by presenting a scenario they thought would expose the absurdity of resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, angels, and spirits.

seemingly ordinary family detail&#8212;seven brothers living within the same covenant community (<a href="/matthew/22-23.htm">Matthew 22:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Their backdrop is the practice of levirate marriage commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5&#8211;6</a>, where a surviving brother takes his deceased brother&#8217;s widow to raise up offspring.<p>&#8226; By stacking the number of brothers to seven (<a href="/mark/12-20.htm">Mark 12:20</a>; <a href="/luke/20-28.htm">Luke 20:28</a>), they hope to magnify the difficulty of deciding whose wife she will be &#8220;in the resurrection.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In doing so, they are challenging Jesus on the reality of bodily resurrection, a doctrine they deny (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The first one married and died without having children</b><p>&#8226; Childlessness in Israel carried heartache and legal implications, because an heir was needed to preserve the family name and inheritance (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-11.htm">Ruth 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The first brother&#8217;s death without offspring triggers the levirate obligation:<p>&#8211; It protects the widow from poverty and social exclusion.<p>&#8211; It safeguards the deceased brother&#8217;s inheritance within the tribe (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The Sadducees highlight the tragic beginning to set up their later question&#8212;if one brother dies childless, succession begins; if it happens repeatedly, whose wife is she in the afterlife?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he left his wife to his brother</b><p>&#8226; The phrase describes the straightforward application of <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>: &#8220;Her husband&#8217;s brother is to take her as his wife, to fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By portraying the custom as merely procedural, the Sadducees ignore its deeper covenant purpose&#8212;continuity of the family line and promise of inheritance (<a href="/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their scenario assumes earthly marriage arrangements must be replicated in eternity, revealing their misunderstanding of both Scripture and God&#8217;s power (<a href="/matthew/22-29.htm">Matthew 22:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus will soon correct them, teaching that resurrection life transcends earthly marriage (<a href="/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>) and is guaranteed by God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness (<a href="/matthew/22-31.htm">Matthew 22:31&#8211;32</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>).<p><hr

The verse underscores the legal and familial responsibilities rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5&#8211;6</a>.
