The context is a king settling accounts with his servants, symbolizing God's judgment. The concept of settling accounts is a common biblical theme, reflecting the final judgment where all will give an account to God (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). The setting of a king and his servants would resonate with Jesus' audience, familiar with the hierarchical structures of ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>a debtor owing ten thousand talents</b><br>The amount of ten thousand talents is hyperbolic, emphasizing the impossibility of repaying such a debt. A single talent was a large sum, equivalent to about 20 years' wages for a laborer. Thus, ten thousand talents would be an astronomical debt, illustrating the magnitude of sin against God. This hyperbole underscores the need for divine forgiveness, as humans cannot repay their spiritual debt. The use of talents connects to other parables, such as the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where talents represent God-given responsibilities and opportunities.<p><b>was brought to him</b><br>The debtor being brought to the king signifies the inevitability of facing judgment. In biblical times, debtors could be summoned before a ruler or judge to settle their debts, often leading to severe consequences if they could not pay. This reflects the spiritual reality that all will stand before God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). The passive voice "was brought" suggests the debtor's lack of control over the situation, highlighting human helplessness without divine intervention. This phrase also foreshadows the grace and mercy that the king, representing God, will extend, pointing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God in the parable, who is settling accounts with his servants.

In the broader parable, Jesus is revealing how God, the ultimate King, will one day review every life (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment underscores God&#8217;s right to call us to account. Just as the king acts deliberately, so the Lord purposefully examines hearts (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals that judgment is not random but part of a planned, righteous process (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A debtor</b><p>&#8220;One of his debtors was brought to him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-24.htm">Matthew 18:24</a>a).<p>&#8226; The servant stands for every person before God, owing an account of stewardship (<a href="/luke/16-1.htm">Luke 16:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;brought&#8221; implies compulsion.

Together they picture an unpayable sum&#8212;comparable to billions today (<a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus chooses this figure to stress the immeasurable weight of sin. Even one transgression breaks fellowship, yet our total record is staggering (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The amount also magnifies God&#8217;s grace that will soon appear in the parable, setting up the contrast between human inability and divine mercy (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was brought to him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;was brought before him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-24.htm">Matthew 18:24</a>c).<p>&#8226; The debtor does not arrive on his own initiative.

A great King initiates a thorough reckoning, and a servant with an impossible debt is compelled to appear. The colossal figure of ten thousand talents illustrates the overwhelming burden of sin each person carries. Yet the scene prepares us for the breathtaking mercy that follows in the parable: what we could never repay, God freely forgives through Christ. The verse invites humble reflection on our need and confident trust in the King whose grace exceeds every debt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Ten thousand talents.</span>--It is hardly necessary to discuss in detail the value in modern coinage of the sum thus described. Assuming the Greek "talent" to have been rightly used by the LXX. translators for the Hebrew <span class= "ital">kikar</span> in <a href="/context/exodus/38-25.htm" title="And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:">Exodus 38:25-26</a>, we have a basis of calculation which makes the talent equal to 3,000 shekels; and taking the shekel as equal to four <span class= "ital">drachmae,</span> this makes the 10,000 talents about 2,500,000 sterling. The sum is evidently named in its vague vastness to indicate the immensity of the debt which man owes to God, the absolute impossibility of his ever clearing off the aggregate, ever-accumulating, of sins of omission and commission which are brought home to his conscience when God "takes account" with him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had begun to reckon.</span> This is the same word which is rendered "take account" in the previous verse, and means to compare receipts, expenditure, and balance. <span class="cmt_word">One was brought unto him.</span> The defaulter did not come of himself and own his delinquency, but was brought into his lord's presence, probably by some who had discovered his defalcations, and desired to see him punished. Otherwise the phrase may refer merely to Oriental etiquette, according to which no one can cuter the royal presence without being formally allowed the interview, and ceremoniously introduced. <span class="cmt_word">Ten thousand talents.</span> It is uncertain what is here meant by a talent, whether of silver or gold, of Jewish, or Attic, or Syriac standard; and, of course, the amount intended is variously understood. We must refer to the Bible dictionaries for an explanation of the term "talent," merely remarking here that the highest estimate would give six millions of our pounds, and the lowest more than half that amount. This huge stun must represent the total revenues of a province, and the debtor must have been a high and much-trusted official. It is used by our Lord to signify the infinite debt the sinner owes to God. Thus in the Lord's Prayer we have, "Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors" (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
