In the context of <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, Jesus is speaking in parables to convey deeper truths about the Kingdom of Heaven. Those who have spiritual insight and a willingness to understand God's word will receive even more revelation and wisdom. This principle is echoed in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where faithful servants are rewarded with greater responsibilities. The idea is that spiritual receptivity leads to increased blessings and understanding.<p><b>and he will have an abundance.</b><br>The promise of abundance is not necessarily material wealth but rather an abundance of spiritual knowledge, grace, and blessings. This abundance is a result of faithfulness and a heart open to God's teachings. In <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, Jesus speaks of coming so that believers may have life and have it abundantly, emphasizing the richness of life in Christ. The abundance here is a fulfillment of spiritual needs and a deeper relationship with God.<p><b>Whoever does not have,</b><br>This phrase refers to those who lack spiritual insight or are unwilling to receive and understand God's word. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it often applied to the religious leaders who were resistant to His message. Their lack of understanding was not due to a lack of opportunity but rather a hardened heart and unwillingness to accept the truth.<p><b>even what he has will be taken away from him.</b><br>This is a warning about the consequences of spiritual neglect and rejection. The little understanding or opportunity one might have can be lost if not nurtured. This principle is seen in the Parable of the Sower (<a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>), where seeds that fall on rocky or thorny ground do not produce fruit. It underscores the importance of being receptive to God's word and the danger of spiritual complacency. The removal of what one has can be seen as a form of judgment for rejecting the truth, as illustrated in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-28</a>, where those who reject God are given over to their own futile thinking.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowds through parables.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, who are given deeper understanding of the mysteries of the Kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowds.htm">Crowds</a></b><br>The larger group of people who follow Jesus and hear His parables, but do not always understand them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/parables.htm">Parables</a></b><br>A teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through simple accounts and analogies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_heaven.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teachings, representing God's reign and rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_and_receptivity.htm">Understanding and Receptivity</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of being open and receptive to His teachings.

Those who receive Jesus&#8217; words in faith are granted ever-increasing insight and blessing, while those who dismiss Him find their limited grasp slipping away. The verse calls believers to keep listening, keep obeying, and keep treasuring every revelation God gives, confident that He literally rewards faithfulness with abundance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Whosoever hath, to him shall be given.</span>--The words have the ring of a proverb applicable, in its literal meaning, to the conditions of worldly prosperity. There fortune smiles on the fortunate, and nothing succeeds like success. Something like that law, our Lord tells His disciples, is to be found in the conditions of spiritual growth in wisdom. They had some elements of that wisdom, and therefore, using their knowledge rightly, could pass on to more. The people, including even scribes and Pharisees, were as those that had few or none, and not using even the little that they had, were in danger of losing even that. The faithless Jew was sinking down to the level of a superstitious heathen. The proverb accordingly teaches the same lesson as that which we afterwards find developed in the parables of the Talents and the Pounds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Matthew only in this context, but found in the parallel passages shortly after the explanation of this parable - <a href="/mark/4-25.htm">Mark 4:25</a>; <a href="/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a>. The same saying is found in <a href="/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a> (the talents) and <a href="/luke/19-26.htm">Luke 19:26</a> (the pounds). <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The reason of God's action spoken of in the preceding verse. It is based on the following principle. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance.</span> The last phrase (Matthew only) is probably dub to a reminiscence of the form in which the saying was uttered at a much later period in our Lord's ministry, where it arises naturally out of the parable (<a href="/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</span> A paradox. What he already possesses, if it is so small as to be not worth speaking of, shall be lost to him. Luke's "thinketh he hath" calls attention to the superficial character of the man's mind. The unfit ground loses the seed it receives (cf. the remarks at the beginning of this chapter). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hostis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">has</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(echei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
