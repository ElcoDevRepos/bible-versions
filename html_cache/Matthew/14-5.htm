His desire to kill John the Baptist stemmed from John's public condemnation of Herod's unlawful marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife. This reflects the tension between political power and prophetic truth, a recurring theme in the Bible where God's messengers often face opposition from rulers (e.g., Elijah and Ahab in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>).<p><b>he was afraid of the people</b><br>Herod's fear of the people highlights the influence and respect John the Baptist commanded among the Jewish populace. This fear indicates Herod's political vulnerability and his awareness of the potential for unrest if he acted against a popular figure. It also underscores the tension between Herod's personal desires and his need to maintain public order, a common dilemma for rulers in biblical narratives.<p><b>because they regarded John as a prophet</b><br>John the Baptist was widely recognized as a prophet, a messenger of God who called for repentance and prepared the way for Jesus Christ. This recognition by the people is significant, as it places John in the line of Old Testament prophets who spoke God's truth to power. The people's regard for John as a prophet also fulfills the expectation of a prophetic voice preceding the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. This acknowledgment by the people contrasts with the rejection of Jesus by many of the religious leaders, highlighting the theme of true spiritual insight versus hardened hearts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, son of Herod the Great.

There was yet a struggle of conscience against passion in the weak and wicked tetrarch, as there was in Ahab in his relations with Elijah. In Herodias, as in Jezebel, there was no halting between two opinions, and she, in the bitterness of her hate, thirsted for the blood of the prophet who had dared to rebuke her guilt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he would have put him</span> <span class="cmt_word">to death, he feared the multitude</span> (cf. <a href="/luke/20-6.htm">Luke 20:6</a>).
