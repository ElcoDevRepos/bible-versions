The disciples had been overwhelmed by the vision of Jesus in His glorified state, alongside Moses and Elijah. The act of looking up signifies a return to their normal perception after experiencing a supernatural event. This moment marks a transition from divine revelation back to earthly reality, emphasizing the importance of focusing on Jesus amidst extraordinary experiences.<p><b>they saw no one</b><br>The disappearance of Moses and Elijah signifies the conclusion of the vision. Moses represents the Law, and Elijah represents the Prophets, both of which find their fulfillment in Jesus Christ. Their departure underscores the supremacy of Jesus and the new covenant He inaugurates. This moment highlights the transition from the old covenant to the new, where Jesus is the central figure. The absence of Moses and Elijah also serves to direct the disciples' attention solely to Jesus, reinforcing His unique role as the Messiah.<p><b>except Jesus</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the exclusivity and sufficiency of Christ. In the context of the Transfiguration, it underscores that Jesus alone is the mediator between God and humanity. The focus on Jesus alone aligns with the broader biblical narrative that He is the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. This moment foreshadows the centrality of Christ in the New Testament and the Christian faith. It also serves as a reminder of the call to discipleship, where believers are to fix their eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is transfigured in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>The three disciples who witnessed the Transfiguration of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus' divine glory was revealed to the disciples on a high mountain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_elijah.htm">Moses and Elijah</a></b><br>Old Testament figures who appeared with Jesus during the Transfiguration, representing the Law and the Prophets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>The unspecified high mountain where the Transfiguration took place, symbolizing a place of divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_jesus_alone.htm">Focus on Jesus Alone</a></b><br>The disciples saw "no one except Jesus," emphasizing that He is the ultimate revelation and fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_supremacy_of_christ.htm">The Supremacy of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus stands alone as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, represented by Moses and Elijah.

It was <span class= "ital">not</span> "good" for frail men such as they were to tarry long in the immediate glory of the Presence. It was a relief to see "Jesus only" with them, as they had been wont to see Him. So in our own lives, moments of spiritual ecstasy are few and far between, and it is good for us that it should be so, and that we should be left to carry the fragrance and power of their memory into the work of our common life, and the light of our common day.<p>It may not be amiss to say a few words as to the credibility of a narrative which is in itself so wonderful, and has been exposed so often to the attacks of a hostile criticism. And (1) it is obvious that what is commonly known as the rationalistic method of interpretation is altogether inapplicable here. The narrative of the Evangelists cannot by any artifice be reduced to a highly-coloured version of some natural phenomenon falling under known laws. If accepted at all, it must be accepted as belonging to the region of the super natural. (2) The so-called mythical theory, which sees in such narratives the purely legendary after-growth of the dreaming fancies of a later age, is of course possible here, as it is possible wherever the arbitrary criticism which postulates the incredibility of the supernatural chooses to apply it; but it may, at least, be urged against its application in this instance that there was nothing in the Jewish expectations of the Messiah likely to suggest such a legend, and that the circumstances connected with it are such (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> its association with our Lord's sufferings, and the strange, abrupt utterance of Peter) as were hardly likely to suggest themselves either to the popular imagination or to that of an individual mind. (3) The position which it occupies both in our Lord's ministry and the spiritual training of the disciples, while, on the one hand, it raises the Transfiguration above the region of a mere marvel, is, it may be urged again, such as was not likely to occur to a simple lover of the marvellous. (4) Lastly, the language of <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> and (though with less certainty, owing to the doubt which hangs over the genuineness of that Epistle) of <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>, may surely be allowed some evidential weight, as being of the nature of allusive reference to a fact which the writers take for granted as generally known. Over and above St. Peter's direct reference, we note the recurrence of the words "decease," "tabernacle," as suggested by it (<a href="/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man, save Jesus only.</span> Moses and Elias had vanished, Jesus was left alone, and the voice Divine said, "Hear him." When at Christ's touch and word the awestruck apostles dared once more to look around and to bethink themselves of what had passed, those were the facts of which they were conscious. The Law and the prophets, types and predictions, are fulfilled in Christ, and are so far superseded. The former were temporary, introductory to the gospel, which is to last forever. Many have seen in the Transfiguration an image and earnest of the future glory of the dead in Christ, when the vile body shall be changed into the likeness of Christ's glorious body, and they shall shine as the sun, and bear the image of the heavenly. So St. Gregory, "He is clothed with light as with a garment, because in that eternal glory he will be clothed with all the saints, to whom it is said, 'Ye are the light of the world.' Whence also it is said by the evangelist, that when the Lord was transfigured in the mountain, his raiment became as snow. In which Transfiguration what else is announced but the glory of the final resurrection? For in the mountain his raiment became as snow, because in the height of heavenly brightness all saints will be joined to him, refulgent with the light of righteousness" ('Moral.,' 32:6). Unbelief has endeavoured to throw discredit on the historical accuracy of the accounts of this great event. It was a dream, an atmospheric disturbance, an unusual play of light and shade, a myth, an allegory; the two heavenly visitants were two unknown disciples with whom Jesus conversed; the three apostles were rapt in a trance, and the vision was purely subjective; these and such like theories have been started by rationalists and enemies of the supernatural, and even by the partially orthodox, as Tertullian ('Adv. Marc., 4:22). There can be no doubt that the evangelists and the Apostle Peter regarded the event as an objective reality, upon which hung momentous truths; and we are content to let it stand or fall with the rest of the facts of the gospel narrative. There is no reason to separate it from the other items of the story. When once the stupendous miracle of the Incarnation is allowed, other wonders follow in natural sequence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they looked up,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eparantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1869.htm">Strong's 1869: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise, lift up.
