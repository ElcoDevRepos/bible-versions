This title acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah, a significant claim that the leaders find troubling. In Jewish tradition, the Messiah was expected to be a political and military leader, and the leaders are concerned about the implications of this public acclamation. The setting is the temple in Jerusalem, a place of significant religious authority, which adds to the tension of the moment.<p><b>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Jesus answered.</b><br>Jesus affirms that He hears the children, indicating His acceptance of their praise. This response is significant because it shows Jesus' willingness to receive worship, a role reserved for God, thus reinforcing His divine identity. His affirmation also challenges the religious leaders' authority and understanding of the Messiah.<p><b>&#8220;Have you never read: &#8216;From the mouths of children and infants You have ordained praise&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>Jesus quotes <a href="/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>, a psalm of David, which speaks of God's strength being established through the praise of children. By referencing this scripture, Jesus highlights the purity and truth of the children's praise, contrasting it with the skepticism of the religious leaders. This citation also underscores the theme of God using the humble and seemingly insignificant to reveal His glory. The use of this psalm connects Jesus to the Davidic line and emphasizes His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The phrase suggests that God has ordained or established praise from the most innocent and humble, indicating that true worship comes from a place of sincerity and purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, responding to the chief priests and scribes with authority and scriptural knowledge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Represent innocence and purity, and are the ones offering praise to Jesus in the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who are questioning Jesus, showing their skepticism and misunderstanding of His identity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a place of worship and teaching, where Jesus is being praised by the children.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalm_8_-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a></b><br>The Old Testament scripture Jesus quotes, highlighting the ordained praise from children and infants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/childlike_faith_and_praise.htm">Childlike Faith and Praise</a></b><br>Embrace a heart of innocence and purity in worship, as children naturally do.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/scriptural_fulfillment.htm">Scriptural Fulfillment</a></b><br>Recognize how Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecies, affirming His identity as the Messiah.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/challenge_to_religious_authority.htm">Challenge to Religious Authority</a></b><br>Understand that true worship and recognition of Jesus may come from unexpected places, challenging established norms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_use_of_the_humble.htm">God's Use of the Humble</a></b><br>Acknowledge that God often uses the humble and seemingly insignificant to reveal His glory and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_knowing_scripture.htm">Importance of Knowing Scripture</a></b><br>Jesus' response underscores the importance of knowing and understanding scripture to discern truth and respond to challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_21_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 21:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_16_Childlike_faith_in_worship.htm">How does Matthew 21:16 emphasize the importance of childlike faith in worship?

It expressed very forcibly the estimate which He formed of their character as interpreters. They spent their lives in the study of the Law, and yet they perverted its meaning, and could not see its bearing on the events that passed around them. In this instance He cites the words of <a href="/psalms/8-2.htm" title="Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you ordained strength because of your enemies, that you might still the enemy and the avenger.">Psalm 8:2</a>, the primary meaning of which appears to be that the child's wonder at the marvels of Creation is the truest worship. As applied by our Lord their lesson was the same. The cries of the children were the utterance of a truth which the priests and scribes rejected. To Him, to whom the innocent brightness of childhood was a delight, they were more acceptable than the half-hearted, self-seeking homage of older worshippers. The words are quoted from the LXX. translation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearest thou what these say?</span> They profess a great zeal for God's honour. They recognize that these cries implied high homage, if not actual worship, and appeal to Jesus to put a stop to such unseemly behaviour, approaching, as they would pretend, to formal blasphemy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. Jesus replies that he hears what the children say, but sees no reason for silencing them; rather he proves that they were only fulfilling an old prophecy, originally, indeed, applied to Jehovah, but one which he claims as addressed to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Have ye never read?</span> (<a href="/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5</a>). The quotation is from the confessedly Messianic psalm (<a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>.), a psalm very often quoted in the New Testament, and as speaking of Christ (see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sucklings</span>. This term was applied to children up to the age of three years (see 2 Macc. 7:27), but might be used metaphorically of those of tender age, though long weaned. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast perfected praise.</span> The words are from the Septuagint, which seems to have preserved the original reading. The present Hebrew text gives, "Thou hast ordained strength," or "established a power." In the Lord's mouth the citation signifies that God is praised acceptably by the weak and ignorant when, following the impulse of their simple nature, they do him homage. Some expositors combine the force of the Hebrew and Greek by explaining that "the strength of the weak is praise, and that worship of Christ is strength" (Wordsworth). It is more simple to say, with Nosgen, that for the Hebrew "strength," "praise" is substituted, in order to give the idea that the children's acclamation was that which would still the enemy, as it certainly put to shame the captious objections of the Pharisees. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Do you hear</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Akoueis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
