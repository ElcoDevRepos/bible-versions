In the biblical context, angels are frequently involved in significant events, such as the announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>) and His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2-7</a>). The sending of angels here underscores the importance and divine orchestration of the event being described.<p><b>with a loud trumpet call</b><br>The trumpet is a symbol of significant events in biblical history, often associated with the presence of God and the gathering of His people. In the Old Testament, trumpets were used to announce the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>) and to signal the gathering of the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2-10</a>). In the New Testament, the trumpet is linked to the return of Christ and the resurrection of the dead (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). The loudness of the trumpet call emphasizes the universal and unmistakable nature of this divine summons.<p><b>and they will gather His elect</b><br>The term "elect" refers to those chosen by God, a concept rooted in the Old Testament where Israel is described as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). In the New Testament, the elect are those who have faith in Christ, encompassing both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>). The gathering of the elect signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people together, a theme echoed in prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>.<p><b>from the four winds</b><br>This phrase symbolizes the universality of the gathering, indicating that God's people will be brought together from all corners of the earth. The "four winds" is a common biblical expression denoting the entirety of the earth (<a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>). It highlights the global scope of God's redemptive plan and the inclusivity of His kingdom.<p><b>from one end of the heavens to the other</b><br>This expression further emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the gathering. It suggests not only a geographical but also a cosmic scope, indicating that no part of creation is beyond God's reach. This mirrors the promise of a new creation where heaven and earth are united under Christ's reign (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>).

He commissions His angels, heralded by an unmistakable trumpet, to bring every living believer&#8212;wherever they are on the planet&#8212;into His immediate presence. The verse assures us that no redeemed person will be forgotten; Christ&#8217;s authority, the angels&#8217; obedience, and the trumpet&#8217;s blast combine to inaugurate the righteous reign promised throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">He shall send his angels.</span>--The words are memorable as the formal expansion of what had been, as it were, hinted before in the parables of the Tares (<a href="/matthew/13-41.htm" title="The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;">Matthew 13:41</a>) and the Net (<a href="/matthew/13-49.htm" title="So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,">Matthew 13:49</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With a great sound of a trumpet.</span>--The better MSS. omit "sound:" <span class= "ital">With a great trumpet.</span> We know not, and cannot know, what reality will answer to this symbol, but it is interesting to note how deeply it impressed itself on the minds not only of the disciples who heard it, but of those who learnt it from them. When St. Paul speaks of the "trumpet" that shall "sound" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>), of "the voice of the archangel and the trump of God" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a>), we feel that he was reproducing what had been thus proclaimed, and that his eschatology, or doctrine of the last things, was based on a knowledge of, at least, the substance of the great prophetic discourse recorded in the Gospels.<p><span class= "bld">They shall gather together his elect.</span>--The "elect" are the same in idea, though not necessarily the same individuals, as those for whom the days were to be shortened in <a href="/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>; and the work of the angels is that of gathering them, wherever they may be scattered, into the one fold. As with so many of the pregnant germs of thought in this chapter, the work of the angels is expanded by the visions of the Apocalypse, when the seer beheld the angels come and seal the hundred and forty-four thousand in their foreheads before the work of judgment should begin (<a href="/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>). In each case the elect are those who are living on the earth at the time of the second Advent. In these chapters there is, indeed, no distinct mention of the resurrection of the dead, though they, as well as the living, are implied in the parable of judgment with which the discourse ends. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His angels.</span> As the executors of his will, to bring before his throne all who have to be judged. They have the same office in the parable of the tares and the wheat (<a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With a great sound of a trumpet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, which may also mean, <span class="accented">with a trumpet of great sound</span>). Some manuscripts, with the Vulgate, read, "with a trumpet and a great voice;" others, "with a great trumpet," omitting "voice." All, however, agree in asserting the employment of the trumpet on this momentous occasion (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). The term may be metaphorical for a voice exceeding loud (comp. <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>); but it is more probably to be taken in the obvious sense, with a reference to its use among the Jews in calling the assembly and giving the alarm. Of course, the occurrence is supernatural. It is, indeed, as great a miracle for a sound to be heard simultaneously in both hemispheres as it is for Christ to be seen at the same moment by all dwellers on the globe. This is a matter to be believed, not explained. <span class="cmt_word">Shall gather together his elect.</span> The angels will infallibly select these from the mass of men, either by spiritual insight or Divine direction. The elect are not Israelites alone, but true believers of all nations (see ver. 14 and <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20, 21</a>).
