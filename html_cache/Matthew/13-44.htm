The "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's sovereign rule and the realm of salvation. In ancient times, it was not uncommon for people to hide valuables in fields to protect them from theft or during times of war. This practice is supported by archaeological findings of buried treasures from various periods in the Middle East. The "treasure" symbolizes the immeasurable value of the kingdom of heaven, which is often hidden from those who do not seek it earnestly. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4-5</a>, where seeking wisdom and understanding is likened to searching for hidden treasures.<p><b>When a man found it, he hid it again,</b><br>The man in the parable represents an individual who discovers the kingdom of heaven. The act of finding suggests a deliberate search or an unexpected discovery, both of which require a response. By hiding the treasure again, the man demonstrates the need to protect and secure the newfound kingdom. This action reflects the biblical principle of valuing and safeguarding spiritual truths, as seen in <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>, where believers' lives are "hidden with Christ in God."<p><b>and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field.</b><br>The man's joy signifies the profound fulfillment and happiness that comes from discovering the kingdom of heaven. This joy is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, where believers are encouraged to "rejoice in the Lord always." Selling all he had indicates the total commitment and sacrifice required to obtain the kingdom. This mirrors the call to discipleship in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to deny themselves and take up their cross. The purchase of the field underscores the idea of securing one's place in the kingdom through wholehearted devotion, reminiscent of the rich young ruler's encounter with Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>, where he is told to sell his possessions to gain eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>Represents God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled.

Nothing we relinquish can compare with the eternal treasure we gain when we belong to Christ and His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a</span> <span class= "bld">field.</span>--Probably no parable in the whole series came more home to the imagination of the disciples than this. Every village had its story of men who had become suddenly rich by finding some hidden hoard that had been hastily concealed in time of war or tumult. Then, as now, there were men who lived in the expectation of finding such treasures, and every traveller who was seen searching in the ruins of an ancient town was supposed to be hunting after them. As far back as the days of Solomon such a search had become a parable for the eager pursuit of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm" title="If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;">Proverbs 2:4</a>). Now they were told to find that which answered to it in their own experience. The conduct of the man who finds the treasure, in concealing the fact of his discovery from the owner of the field, hardly corresponds with our notions of integrity, but parables--as in the case of the Unjust Steward (<a href="/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a>) and the Unjust Judge (<a href="/luke/18-2.htm" title="Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:">Luke 18:2</a>)--do not concern themselves with these questions, and it is enough if they bring out the salient points--in this case, the eagerness of the man to obtain the treasure, and the sacrifice he is ready to make for it. Jewish casuistry, in such matters, applied the maxim, <span class= "ital">Caveat emptor,</span> to the seller rather than the buyer, and the minds of the disciples would hardly be shocked at what would seem to them a natural stroke of sharpness.<p>In the interpretation of the parable, the case described is that of a man who, not having started in the pursuit of holiness or truth, is brought by the seeming accidents of life--a chance meeting, a word spoken in season, the example of a living holiness--to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to Christ Himself, and who, finding in Him a peace and joy above all earthly treasure, is ready to sacrifice the lower wealth in order to obtain the higher. Such, we may well believe, had been the history of the publicans and the fishermen who made up the company of the Twelve. The parable had its fulfilment in them when they, at the bidding of their Lord, "forsook all and followed Him." Such, it need hardly be said, has been the story of thousands of the saints of God in every age of the Church's life from that day to this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the hidden treasure found.</span> Matthew only. It seems probable, from ver. 51, that this and the next two parables were spoken to the disciples in private. They alone would appreciate the value of what they had found; to them alone could the warning be as yet given, that it is not sufficient to have been gathered within the gospel net. Observe in this parable that the treasure was found by chance, and it was near to the man without his knowing it. <span class="cmt_word">Again</span>. To be omitted, with the Revised Version and Westcott and Hort. Its absence (contrast vers. 45, 47) suggests that this parable is the first of a group, marked as such either by our Lord beginning with it after he had made a pause, or by merely coming first in one of the sources that the evangelist used. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven</span> (ver. 24, note) <span class="cmt_word">is like unto treasure hid in a field</span> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>). <span class="accented">Hid</span> (<span class="accented">hidden</span>, Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>). It was not there by accident; it had been purposely placed there, hid by its former possessor for safety (<a href="/matthew/25-18.htm">Matthew 25:18, 25</a>). Observe that, doubtless unintentionally on the part of the evangelist, the parable forms in this respect the complement to ver. 35<span class="accented">b</span>. <span class="accented">In a field</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">in the field</span> (Revised Version); cf. <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">The which when a</span> <span class="cmt_word">man hath found, he hideth;</span> <span class="accented">which a man found, and hid</span> (Revised Version). For fear some one else should take it. Premature assertion would lose the man the treasure. (For a similar truth in spiritual things, cf. <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And for joy thereof</span>. So also the margin of the Revised Version; but <span class="accented">and in his joy</span> (Revised Version) is better (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> <span class="accented">Goeth</span>... <span class="accented">selleth</span>... <span class="accented">buyeth.</span> All in the present tense. Our Lord in this parable (contrast ver. 46) brings the man vividly before us in each separate stage of his action. For the self-denial that is a necessary of acquiring gospel privileges, comp. <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a> (where contrast the young man's grief with the joy spoken of here). <span class="accented">Field.</span> Observe that, though the figure is the same as in ver. 24, the thing signified is very different. Here <span class="accented">field</span> represents merely that which contains the treasure, perhaps the outward profession of Christianity. <span class="accented">All.</span> Westcott and Hort omit, chiefly on the authority of the Vatican manuscript (cf. ver. 46, note). <span class="accented">And buyeth that field.</span> Into the morality of the action our Lord does not enter; he only illustrates his teaching by an incident that must have happened not un-frequently in a country like Palestine, which had already been the scene of so many wars. But the transaction "was, at least, in entire accordance with Jewish law. If a man had found a treasure in loose coins among the corn, it would certainly be his, if he bought the corn. If he had found it on the ground, or in the soil, it would equally certainly belong to him, if he could claim ownership of the soil, and even if the field were not his own, unless others could <span class="accented">prove</span> their right to it. The law went so far as to adjudge to the purchaser of fruits anything found among these fruits" (Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:595). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
