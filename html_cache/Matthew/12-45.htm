The number seven often symbolizes completeness or fullness in biblical literature, suggesting a complete or intensified state of evil. The idea of spirits being more wicked indicates a hierarchy or varying degrees of malevolence among demonic forces. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the spiritual realm during the time of Jesus, where exorcism and spiritual purity were significant concerns. The act of bringing more spirits suggests a deliberate strategy to reinforce the hold on the individual, highlighting the persistent and escalating nature of evil when not countered by the presence of God.<p><b>and they go in and dwell there</b><br>The use of "dwell" implies a sense of permanence or long-term habitation, indicating that the spirits intend to establish a stronghold within the person. This reflects the biblical theme of the body as a temple, which can be inhabited by either the Holy Spirit or unclean spirits. The concept of dwelling also connects to the Old Testament, where God&#8217;s presence dwelled in the tabernacle or temple, contrasting with the unclean spirits' desire to inhabit and corrupt. This phrase underscores the importance of spiritual vigilance and the need for a life filled with the Holy Spirit to prevent such occupation.<p><b>And the final plight of that man is worse than the first</b><br>This statement serves as a warning about the dangers of spiritual complacency and the consequences of failing to fill one's life with righteousness after experiencing deliverance. The worsening condition signifies the increased vulnerability and bondage that can occur when one does not maintain spiritual discipline and protection. It echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/2_peter/2-20.htm">2 Peter 2:20-22</a>, where returning to sin after knowing the truth results in a more severe state. This highlights the necessity of ongoing spiritual growth and the transformative power of a relationship with Christ to prevent regression into a worse condition.<p><b>So will it be with this wicked generation</b><br>Here, Jesus applies the parable to His contemporary audience, the generation that witnessed His miracles and teachings yet remained unrepentant. This reflects the broader biblical theme of accountability and judgment for those who reject divine revelation. The term "wicked generation" recalls the language used by the prophets in the Old Testament to describe Israel's unfaithfulness and rebellion against God. It serves as a prophetic warning that the spiritual state of the people will deteriorate if they continue to reject Jesus as the Messiah. This phrase emphasizes the urgency of repentance and the acceptance of Christ's message to avoid spiritual decline and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, providing a warning and teaching about spiritual realities and the state of the generation He was addressing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_spirit.htm">The Unclean Spirit</a></b><br>Represents evil influences or demonic forces that can inhabit a person or generation, leaving and returning with greater force if not replaced with righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes individuals or groups who experience temporary relief from evil but fail to fill their lives with Godly presence, leading to a worse state.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_generation.htm">The Wicked Generation</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Jesus' time who were rejecting His message and thus were vulnerable to greater spiritual peril.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_other_spirits.htm">Seven Other Spirits</a></b><br>Indicates the completeness and severity of the evil that can return if a person or generation does not turn to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>Believers must remain vigilant and not become complacent after experiencing deliverance or spiritual victories.

(2) What to the seven other spirits joined with the first, and yet more evil? (3) What is the last state, yet future at the time our Lord spoke, which was to be worse than the first? The answer to the first question lies on the surface of their history. Their besetting sin from the time of the Exodus to that of the Captivity had been idolatry and apostasy. The worship of other gods exercised a strange and horrible fascination over them, deprived them, as it were, of light, reason, and true freedom of will. They were enslaved and possessed. Then came the return from the Exile, when, not so much by the teaching of the prophets as by that of the scribes and the Pharisees, idolatry seemed banished for ever. But the house was "empty, swept, and garnished." There was no in dwelling presence of the enthusiasm of a higher life, only an outward ceremonial religion and rigid precepts, and the show of piety. The hypocrisy of the scribes was the garnishing of the house. And then the old evil came back in the form of Mammon-worship, the covetousness which is idolatry (<a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>), and with it, bitterness and hate, and the license of divorce, and self-righteousness, and want of sympathy, and that antagonism to good which had come so terribly near to "the sin against the Holy Ghost." That state was bad enough as it was, but our Lord's words point to a future that should be yet worse. We must turn to the picture drawn by the Jewish historian of the crimes, frenzies, insanities of the final struggle that ended in the destruction of Jerusalem, if we would take an adequate measure of the "last state" of that "wicked generation."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>.
