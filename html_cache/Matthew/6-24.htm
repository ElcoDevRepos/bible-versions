The idea of serving two masters would have been seen as impossible, as loyalty and obedience would be divided. This phrase emphasizes the exclusivity of devotion required in a relationship with God, reflecting the biblical theme of wholehearted commitment found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>Either he will hate the one and love the other:</b><br>This phrase highlights the natural human tendency to develop strong preferences and loyalties. In biblical terms, "hate" and "love" often denote choice and priority rather than emotional extremes. The language here echoes the covenantal language of the Old Testament, where Israel is called to choose God over idols (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). The choice between two masters is a choice between two paths, reflecting the broader biblical theme of choosing between life and death, blessing and curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><b>or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other:</b><br>Devotion implies a deep commitment and allegiance, while to despise means to regard with contempt or disdain. This reflects the biblical principle that one cannot maintain equal allegiance to conflicting interests. The call to devotion is a call to prioritize God above all else, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which calls for undivided loyalty to God. The language of devotion and contempt underscores the impossibility of neutrality in spiritual matters.<p><b>You cannot serve both God and money:</b><br>The term "money" here is translated from the Aramaic word "mammon," which personifies wealth and material possessions as a rival deity. This phrase serves as a warning against the idolatry of wealth, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Jesus' teaching here aligns with the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, which warns of the dangers of trusting in riches. The juxtaposition of God and money as masters highlights the spiritual conflict between serving God and pursuing material wealth, a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings (e.g., <a href="/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>). This statement calls believers to examine their priorities and to choose God as their ultimate master, reflecting the call to seek first the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a foundational teaching of Christian ethics and discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to follow Christ's teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate master whom believers are called to serve with undivided loyalty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/money.htm">Money (Mammon)</a></b><br>Represents wealth and material possessions, often personified as a rival master to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sermon_on_the_mount.htm">Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The larger context of this teaching, where Jesus addresses various aspects of righteous living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/undivided_loyalty.htm">Undivided Loyalty</a></b><br>Believers are called to serve God with an undivided heart.

Scripture calls believers to entrust needs to the Father, invest treasures in heaven, and live as servants whose hearts, time, and resources unmistakably proclaim, &#8220;The LORD, He is God&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">No man can serve two masters.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">can be the slave of two masters.</span> The clauses that follow describe two distinct results of the attempt to combine the two forms of service which are really incompatible. In most cases, there will be love for the one, and a real hatred for the other. The man who loves God cannot love the evil world, and, so far as it is evil, will learn to hate it. The man who loves the world will, even in the midst of lip-homage, hate the service of God in his inmost heart. But there are natures which seem hardly susceptible of such strong emotions as love or hatred. In that case there will be a like though not an identical, issue. The man's will will drift in one direction or another. He will cleave to one with such affection as he is capable of, and will hold the other cheap. God or mammon, not both together, will be the ruling power with him.<p><span class= "bld">Mammon.</span>--The word means in Syriac "money" or "riches," and is used in this sense in <a href="/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>. It occurs frequently in the Chaldee Targum, but no word resembling it is found in the Hebrew of the Old Testament. In the fourth century Jerome found it in use in Syria, and Augustine in the Punic dialect of his native country. There is no ground for believing that it ever became the name of any deity, who, like the Plutus of the Greeks, was worshipped as the god of wealth. Here, there is obviously an approach to a personification for the sake of contrasting the service or worship of money with that which is due to God. Milton's description of Mammon among the fallen angels is a development of the same thought (<span class= "ital">Par. Lost, I.</span> 678).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man can serve two masters</span>, etc. In <a href="/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a> the saying is found almost word for word immediately after the parable of the unjust steward. As the word "mammon" comes twice in that parable, but nowhere else in the New Testament, it is probable that its occurrence caused the insertion of this saying in that place (cf. ver. 22, note). <span class="accented">No man can serve two masters.</span> The thought is still of earnestness of purpose and singleness of heart. Our Lord here speaks of the impossibility of such divided service as he has been warning his disciples against attempting. No man can give due service to two masters. For, apart from the extent of the claim of each master - total bond-service (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) - thorough service of two masters is incompatible with the effects produced upon the servant himself. The result of service is to incline him towards the one master and against the other. Notice how our Lord continues his plan of setting forth the moral effect of modes of thought or action upon the agents themselves (cf. <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For either he will hate the one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and love the other.</span> Because human nature is such that it must attach itself to one of two principles. "Cor hominis neque its vacuum esse potest, ut non serviat <span class="accented">ant Dee aut</span> creaturae: neque simul duobus servire" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Or else he will hold to</span> <span class="cmt_word">the one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The Revised Version omits "the." The stress here is on "one - not both." <span class="accented">Hold to</span>; in steadfast application (cf. Ellicott, on <a href="/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye cannot serve God and mammon</span>; "Ye moun not serve god and ricchesse" (Wickliffe). A repetition of the statement of the impossibility of serving two masters, but more than a repetition, for it is enforced by defining who the masters are. <span class="accented">Mammon.</span> The change in the Revised Version from a capital to a small <span class="accented">m</span> has probably been made to prevent "mammon" being understood as the proper name of some god. The derivation of the word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span>) is very doubtful. The most probable suggestion is that it is formed from the stem of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, and is equivalent to that which is apportioned or counted (cf. Levy, 'Neuheb. Worterb.,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span>; Edersheim, 'Life,' 2. p. 269). Hence its well-known meaning of property, wealth, especially money. Observe that our Lord does not here contrast God and Satan; he is emphasizing the thought which he has been adducing since ver. 19, viz., the relation that his disciples must hold to things of earth, which are summed up by him under the term "mammon" as with us under the term "wealth." Observe also that it is not the possession of wealth that he condemns, but the serving it, making it an object of thought and pursuit. Gathering it and using it in the service of and according to the will of God is not serving mammon (cf.
