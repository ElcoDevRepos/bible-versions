The Passover meal commemorates Israel's deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing liberation and salvation. The setting is significant as it foreshadows Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice will bring spiritual deliverance. The communal meal emphasizes fellowship and unity, contrasting with the impending betrayal.<p><b>He said to them</b><br>Jesus addresses His disciples directly, highlighting His role as teacher and leader. His words carry authority and foreknowledge, demonstrating His divine insight. This moment underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples, who have followed Him closely throughout His ministry.<p><b>Truly I tell you</b><br>This phrase, often used by Jesus, underscores the certainty and importance of His statement. It is a solemn declaration, indicating that what follows is of great significance. Jesus often uses this phrase to introduce profound truths or prophecies, emphasizing His role as the bearer of divine revelation.<p><b>one of you will betray Me</b><br>The prediction of betrayal introduces a moment of tension and sorrow. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. This statement reveals the human frailty and sinfulness even among Jesus' closest followers. It also highlights Jesus' foreknowledge and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, where even acts of betrayal are woven into the divine purpose. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, is the one who will fulfill this prophecy, illustrating the tragic reality of free will and the consequences of turning away from Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is foretelling His betrayal during the Last Supper.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve men chosen by Jesus to follow Him and learn from His teachings.

The verse reminds us that sin can hide in the midst of worship if hearts are untouched.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said to them</b><p>&#8226; Jesus speaks directly to the Twelve, those who have walked with Him for three and a half years. <a href="/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a> parallels the moment: &#8220;After He had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, &#8216;Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; His words are personal&#8212;He does not send an angel or use a parable. He lovingly confronts His own, showing the shepherd&#8217;s care (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Every disciple must face the possibility of hidden disloyalty; Jesus&#8217; address forces self-examination (<a href="/matthew/26-22.htm">Matthew 26:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Truly I tell you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Truly&#8221; is Jesus&#8217; solemn guarantee. Whenever He says it (e.g., <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>; 24:35), He underlines absolute certainty.<p>&#8226; Here He assures them the prediction is not hypothetical. No room remains for minimizing or spiritualizing; it will happen exactly as stated.<p>&#8226; This phrase also offers comfort: the same God who foresees betrayal also foreknows redemption (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), so His purposes cannot be derailed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one of you will betray Me</b><p>&#8226; The prophecy is precise&#8212;&#8220;one of you,&#8221; not an outsider. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a> foretold a close companion selling the Messiah for thirty pieces of silver, fulfilled literally in Judas (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>; 27:3-10).<p>&#8226; Betrayal does not catch Jesus off guard. He remains in full control, steering events toward the cross (<a href="/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes each disciple&#8217;s heart. Eleven grieve; one persists in secret sin. This contrast foreshadows the wheat and the tares growing together until harvest (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today: proximity to Jesus&#8217; teachings and His people is no substitute for genuine faith and obedience (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/26-21.htm">Matthew 26:21</a> captures a moment of breathtaking honesty at the Passover table. In the midst of covenant fellowship, Jesus plainly announces a certain, insider betrayal. He knows it, controls it, and still loves His disciples through it. The verse warns against hidden sin, reassures us of God&#8217;s sovereign plan, and calls every follower to heartfelt loyalty rather than mere outward association.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">One</span> <span class= "bld">of you shall betray me.</span>--The words would seem to have been intentionally vague, as if to rouse some of those who heard them to self-questioning. They had not, it is true, shared in the very guilt of the Traitor, but they had yielded to tendencies which they had in common with him, and which were dragging them down to his level. They had joined him in his murmuring (<a href="/matthew/26-8.htm" title="But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?">Matthew 26:8</a>), they had been quarrelling, and were about to renew their quarrel, about precedence (<a href="/mark/9-34.htm" title="But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.">Mark 9:34</a>, <a href="/luke/22-24.htm" title="And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.">Luke 22:24</a>). It was well that the abyss should be laid bare before their eyes, and that each should ask himself whether he were indeed on the point of falling into it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they did eat.</span> The details of the Paschal feast are expounded by rabbinical authors, though there is little in St. Matthew's account to lead us to conclude that our Lord observed them on this occasion. The ceremonial usually practised was as follows: The head of the family, sitting in the place of honour, took a cup of wine and water mixed ("the first cup"), pronounced a thanksgiving over it, and, having tasted it, passed it round to the guests; the master washed his hands, the others performing their ablutions at a later part of the service; the dishes were placed on the table; after a special benediction had been spoken over the bitter herbs, the master and the rest of the company took a bunch of these, dipped it in the appointed sauce, and ate it; an unleavened cake was broken and elevated with a prescribed formula; the second cup was filled, the history of the festival was proclaimed, <a href="/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>, were recited, and the cup was drunk. Now began the proper Paschal meal with a general washing of hands; the lamb was cut into pieces, anda portion given to each, with a bit of the unleavened bread and bitter herbs dipped in the sauce, called by St. John (<a href="/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>) "the sop." At the end of the meal, which was supplemented by other viands (which, however, were probably eaten before the lamb), the third cup, named by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>) "the cup of blessing," was drunk, and the solemn grace after meat was uttered. It would be necessary to examine St. John's Gospel to see how the ritual fitted into the actual details of the last Supper; we have to deal with St. Matthew's account. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> Christ thus prepares the apostles for the incredible statement which he is about to make. <span class="cmt_word">One of you;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

He had before spoken vaguely of his betrayal (see <a href="/matthew/17-22.htm">Matthew 17:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a>). By thus showing his knowledge of the coming treachery, and yet declining to denounce the traitor by name, he may have given Judas a last chance of repentance before the final act. St. Matthew omits the washing of the disciples' feet, and the strife about pre-eminence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And while</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they were eating,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#952;&#953;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(esthiont&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2068.htm">Strong's 2068: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strengthened for a primary edo; used only in certain tenses, the rest being supplied by phago; to eat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
