In the context of <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, Jesus is speaking about the end times and the great distress that will occur. The "days" mentioned are often interpreted as a time of unprecedented hardship, possibly linked to the Great Tribulation described in Revelation. The idea of days being "cut short" suggests divine intervention to prevent total destruction. This reflects God's sovereignty and mercy, ensuring that the period of suffering is limited for the sake of humanity.<p><b>nobody would be saved</b><br>The severity of the tribulation is emphasized here, indicating that without divine intervention, no one would survive. This underscores the catastrophic nature of the events being described. The term "saved" can be understood both physically, in terms of survival, and spiritually, in terms of eternal salvation. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's deliverance and protection of His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a> and <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>.<p><b>But for the sake of the elect</b><br>The "elect" refers to those chosen by God, often understood as believers or the faithful. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is described as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). In the New Testament, the term expands to include all who follow Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>. The protection and preservation of the elect highlight God's faithfulness to His promises and His care for His people.<p><b>those days will be cut short</b><br>This reiterates the assurance of divine intervention. The repetition emphasizes God's control over history and His commitment to His people. The cutting short of the days serves as a reminder of God's mercy and the fulfillment of His prophetic word. It also points to the hope and deliverance that believers can expect, even in the midst of trials, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, providing insight into the end times and the tribulation period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elect.htm">The Elect</a></b><br>Refers to God's chosen people, those who are saved and follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribulation.htm">The Tribulation</a></b><br>A future period of great suffering and distress, as described by Jesus in the Olivet Discourse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus delivered this discourse, significant in eschatological events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_end_times.htm">The End Times</a></b><br>The period leading up to the return of Christ, characterized by trials and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>God's control over history is evident as He shortens the days of tribulation for the sake of the elect, demonstrating His mercy and care for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_being_part_of_the_elect.htm">The Importance of Being Part of the Elect</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to examine their faith and ensure they are living in accordance with God's will, as the elect are those who are saved.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_times_of_trial.htm">Endurance in Times of Trial</a></b><br>Christians are called to remain steadfast and faithful during difficult times, trusting in God's promise to protect and deliver His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Hope in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The assurance that God will intervene for the sake of the elect provides hope and encouragement to believers facing trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_the_gospel.htm">Urgency of the Gospel</a></b><br>The reality of the end times should motivate believers to share the Gospel, as God's desire is for all to be saved.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_24_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 24:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_22_God_s_mercy_in_shortened_days.htm">How does Matthew 24:22 emphasize God's mercy in shortening the days?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_the_elect_in_Matthew_24_22.htm">What role do "the elect" play in the context of Matthew 24:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Prepare_for_end_times_in_Matthew_24_22.htm">How can we prepare for end times as described in Matthew 24:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/OT_prophecies_matching_Matthew_24_22.htm">Which Old Testament prophecies align with the message in Matthew 24:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_22_Persevere_in_trials.htm">How does Matthew 24:22 encourage perseverance during trials and tribulations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_days_shortened_in_Matt_24_22.htm">What does Matthew 24:22 mean by "those days will be shortened"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_22_and_divine_intervention.htm">How does Matthew 24:22 relate to the concept of divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_shorten_days_for_the_elect.htm">Why would God choose to shorten the days for the sake of the elect?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_laughter_bring_joy_to_the_heart.htm">Who can condemn if God justifies us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_salvation_for_all_or_just_the_elect.htm">Is salvation available to all or only the elect?

Yet, motivated by covenant love for His elect, He will shorten the ordeal, preserving a remnant and showcasing His absolute sovereignty over judgment and salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Should no flesh be saved.</span>--The words are of course limited by the context to the scene of the events to which the prophecy refers. The warfare with foes outside the city, and the faction-fights and massacres within, would have caused an utter depopulation of the whole country.<p><span class= "bld">For the elect's sake.</span>--Those who, as believers in Jesus, were the "remnant" of the visible Israel, and therefore the true Israel of God. It was for the sake of the Christians of Judaea, not for that of the rebellious Jews, that the war was not protracted, and that Titus, under the outward influences of Josephus and Bernice, tempered his conquests with compassion (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xii. 3, ? 2; <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> vi. 9, ? 2). The new prominence which the idea of an election gains in our Lord's later teaching is every way remarkable. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/18-7.htm" title="Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!">Matthew 18:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-6.htm" title="And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why stand you here all the day idle?">Matthew 20:6</a>). The "call" had been wide; in those who received and obeyed it He taught men to recognise the "elect" whom God had chosen. Subtle questions as to whether the choice rested on foreknowledge or was absolutely arbitrary lay, if we may reverently so speak, outside the scope of His teaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except these days should be shortened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">had been</span> <span class="accented">shortened</span>). In the midst of wrath God thinks on mercy. He providentially ordained that the days of vengeance should not be indefinitely prolonged; the siege was practically of short duration, the country was not wholly overrun and desolated (comp. <a href="/2_kings/13-23.htm">2 Kings 13:23</a>). The natural causes that combined to produce this shortening of the siege have been recounted by commentators. These were - the divided counsels of the Jews themselves, the voluntary surrender of parts of the fortifications, the fierce factions in the city, the destruction of magazines of provisions by calamitous fire, the suddenness of the arrival of Titus, and the fact that the walls had never been strengthened, as Herod Agrippa had intended. <span class="cmt_word">There should no flesh be saved;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole Jewish nation would have been annihilated. <span class="cmt_word">For the elect's sake.</span> At the intercession of the escaped Christians, who offered up unceasing prayer for their brethren and countrymen, God lessened the duration of the calamities. "The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working" (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). Ten righteous would have saved Sodom; Lot's intercession did preserve Zoar (comp. <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>). Some, not so suitably, explain "the elect" to be those Jews who should hereafter turn to the Lord; or the elect seed, "beloved for the fathers' sake" (<a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>). We may well believe that the local tribulations, such as are intimated by Daniel and Christ, and their limitation in time, are a picture of what shall happen in the last days, the intermediate fulfilment being the prelude of the final accomplishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/24-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
