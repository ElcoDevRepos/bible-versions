The Canaanites were historically enemies of Israel, and this encounter underscores the breaking of traditional barriers. Jesus' use of "O woman" is both respectful and compassionate, indicating His willingness to engage with those outside the Jewish community. This reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, which often reached beyond the boundaries of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;your faith is great!</b><br>Jesus commends the woman's faith, which is significant given her Gentile background. This acknowledgment of her faith contrasts with the frequent rebukes of the lack of faith among the Jewish leaders and even His own disciples. The woman's persistent faith, despite initial silence and apparent rejection, exemplifies the kind of faith that pleases God. This moment foreshadows the opening of the Gospel to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius and the broader mission to the Gentiles.<p><b>Let it be done for you as you desire.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus grants the woman's request, demonstrating His authority and compassion. This phrase echoes the biblical principle that faith can move mountains (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>). It also aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a> about asking, seeking, and knocking. The granting of her desire illustrates the power of intercessory prayer and the importance of approaching God with humility and persistence.<p><b>And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</b><br>The immediate healing of the woman's daughter signifies Jesus' divine power and authority over illness and demonic oppression. This miracle serves as a testament to Jesus' messianic identity and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's healing ministry (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>). The phrase "from that very hour" emphasizes the instantaneous nature of the miracle, reinforcing the theme of Jesus' sovereignty and the efficacy of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanite_woman.htm">The Canaanite Woman</a></b><br>A Gentile woman from the region of Tyre and Sidon who approaches Jesus with a request to heal her demon-possessed daughter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter.htm">The Daughter</a></b><br>The afflicted child of the Canaanite woman, who is healed by Jesus as a result of her mother's faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who witness this interaction and learn about the inclusivity of Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre_and_sidon.htm">Tyre and Sidon</a></b><br>Regions outside of Israel, indicating the expansion of Jesus' ministry to Gentile territories.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_persistent_faith.htm">The Power of Persistent Faith</a></b><br>The Canaanite woman's persistence in seeking Jesus despite initial rejection demonstrates the power of unwavering faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_boundaries.htm">Faith Beyond Boundaries</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the Canaanite woman shows that faith transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries, inviting all to believe in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_approach.htm">Humility in Approach</a></b><br>The woman's humble approach to Jesus, acknowledging her unworthiness, is a model for how we should approach God in prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith_in_healing.htm">The Role of Faith in Healing</a></b><br>The healing of the woman's daughter illustrates the connection between faith and divine intervention, encouraging believers to trust in God's power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>This passage highlights the inclusivity of Jesus' message, foreshadowing the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_15_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 15:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_28_Power_of_persistent_faith.htm">How does Matthew 15:28 demonstrate the power of persistent faith in Jesus?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Canaanite_woman_s_faith_2.htm">What can we learn from the Canaanite woman's approach to Jesus in Matthew 15:28?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_28_Hebrews_11_6_on_faith.htm">How does Matthew 15:28 connect with Hebrews 11:6 about faith's importance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Canaanite_faith_to_daily_life.htm">How can we apply the Canaanite woman's faith to our daily challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matthew_15_28_inspire_trust.htm">In what ways does Matthew 15:28 encourage us to trust Jesus' compassion and power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_28_Jesus_on_faith_persistence.htm">How does Matthew 15:28 demonstrate Jesus' view on faith and persistence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_first_ignore_her_request.htm">Why did Jesus initially ignore the Canaanite woman's request in Matthew 15:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Cultural_barriers_in_Matthew_15_28.htm">What cultural barriers are challenged by Jesus' response in Matthew 15:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_call_the_woman_a_dog.htm">Why did Jesus refer to the Canaanite woman as a dog?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_call_a_woman_a_'dog'.htm">If Jesus was sinless, why did He call a Gentile woman a &#8220;dog&#8221;

The title draws attention to her identity&#8212;a Canaanite outsider&#8212;yet Christ engages her personally, showing that the gospel reaches beyond ethnic borders (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling, not dismissing, He affirms the worth of every seeker who comes to Him (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus answered</b><p>&#8226;

(<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s response reminds believers that delays refine, not deny, earnest faith (<a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your faith is great!</b><p>&#8226;

The Lord honors her by addressing her respectfully, responding after testing, praising her great faith, granting her request, and delivering her daughter instantly. The passage affirms that anyone&#8212;regardless of background&#8212;who approaches Christ with resolute faith will find Him powerful, compassionate, and entirely trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">O woman, great is thy faith.</span>--The answer of the woman changed the conditions of the problem, and therefore, we may reverently add, changed the purpose which depended on them. Here again, as in the case of the centurion, our Lord found a faith greater than He had met with in Israel. The woman was, in St. Paul's words, a child of the faith, though not of the flesh, of Abraham (<a href="/romans/4-16.htm" title="Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,">Romans 4:16</a>), and as such was entitled to its privileges. She believed in the love of God her Father, in the pity even of the Prophet who had answered her with words of seeming harshness.<p><span class= "bld">Be</span> <span class= "bld">it unto thee even as thou wilt.</span>--St. Mark adds, as spoken by our Lord, "Go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter," and that when the woman went to her house, she found her child laid on the bed, calm and peace and slumber having taken the place of restless frenzy.<p>It is obvious that the lesson of the story stretches far and wide. Wherever man or woman is by birth, or creed, or even sin, among those whom the judgment of the heirs of religious privileges counts unworthy even of the lowest of spiritual blessings, among outcasts and heirs of shame, the excommunicated and the lost, there the thought that "the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs" may bring, as it has often brought, the faith that changes despair into something not far short of the full assurance of hope.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O woman, great is thy faith.</span> Jesus had often to complain of unbelief in his hearers; at no man's faith did he ever express surprise, except in the case of another Gentile, the centurion of Capernaum (<a href="/matthew/8-10.htm">Matthew 8:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</span> She had conquered; she gained her wish. But we must not think that Christ consented because his human feelings were overcome by her importunity, like the unjust judge in the parable, though the principle and teaching of that parable were here beautifully illustrated. He acted all the time as God, who foreknew what he would do. He had been leading her up to this climax; he had willed to give her an opportunity of exhibiting this trust and sell-command and unfailing confidence, and now he crowns her with his mighty eulogium, and grants her request, rewarding her great faith by a great mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Her daughter was made whole.</span> St. Mark reports the words of Christ, "For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter." He does not say, "I will come and heal her;" he tells her that the cure is already effected. Without personal contact with the sufferer, without any command uttered to the possessing demon, by his silent will alone the wonder comes to pass. This blessing for the child was won by the mother's faith. The two points to be remarked in this marvellous history are - Christ's abnormal treatment of a suppliant, and that suppliant's astonishing faith and perseverance.
