It underscores the reality of the resurrection, as Jesus physically meets them on their way. This encounter fulfills His promise of rising on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). The suddenness emphasizes the divine intervention and the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, where the suffering servant is promised life after death.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Greetings!&#8221;</b><br>The greeting is simple yet profound, indicating peace and reassurance. In the cultural context, such a greeting would be customary, but coming from the risen Christ, it carries deeper significance. It signifies the restoration of relationship and the beginning of a new era. This echoes the angelic announcement of peace at Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>), now fulfilled in His victory over death.<p><b>They came to Him</b><br>The women&#8217;s approach to Jesus demonstrates their faith and devotion. In the context of first-century Judea, women were not typically considered reliable witnesses, yet they are the first to see the risen Lord. This highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel and the breaking of societal norms, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where all are one in Christ.<p><b>grasped His feet</b><br>Grasping His feet signifies both the physical reality of the resurrection and an act of submission and reverence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, touching the feet of a superior was a sign of respect and humility. This act confirms that Jesus is not a ghost or vision but has a tangible, resurrected body, as further evidenced in <a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>.<p><b>and worshiped Him</b><br>The worship of Jesus by the women is a recognition of His divinity and messianic identity. Worship is reserved for God alone, and their response affirms Jesus as Lord and God, fulfilling Thomas's later declaration in <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>. This act of worship connects to Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah being worshiped, such as in <a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27-28</a>, and foreshadows the universal worship of Christ in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who appears to the women after His resurrection, affirming His victory over death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>Likely Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, who were the first to witness the resurrected Jesus and were tasked with informing the disciples.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_meeting.htm">The Meeting</a></b><br>This event occurs as the women are on their way to tell the disciples about the empty tomb, highlighting the immediacy and personal nature of Jesus' resurrection appearances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Reality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The physical appearance of Jesus to the women underscores the bodily resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_women_in_the_resurrection_narrative.htm">The Role of Women in the Resurrection Narrative</a></b><br>The women are the first to see and worship the risen Christ, highlighting their important role in the early church and the spread of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_response_to_jesus.htm">Worship as a Response to Jesus</a></b><br>The immediate reaction of the women is to worship, demonstrating the appropriate response to encountering the risen Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_personal_nature_of_jesus'_appearances.htm">The Personal Nature of Jesus' Appearances</a></b><br>Jesus meets the women personally, showing His care and the personal relationship He offers to His followers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_commission_to_share_the_good_news.htm">The Commission to Share the Good News</a></b><br>The women are tasked with telling the disciples, illustrating the call for all believers to share the message of the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_28_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 28:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_28_9_Jesus_authority_post-resurrection.htm">How does Matthew 28:9 demonstrate Jesus' authority and divinity after His resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Women_s_response_in_Matt_28_9_on_worship.htm">What does the women's response in Matthew 28:9 teach about worship and reverence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_women_s_instant_Jesus_recognition.htm">How can we apply the women's immediate recognition of Jesus in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_OT_prophecies_does_Jesus_fulfill.htm">What Old Testament prophecies are fulfilled by Jesus' resurrection in Matthew 28:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_28_9_inspire_sharing_Jesus.htm">How does Matthew 28:9 encourage us to share the news of Jesus' resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_28_9_s_role_in_Jesus_resurrection.htm">How does Matthew 28:9 support the resurrection of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_appear_to_women_first_in_Matthew_28_9.htm">Why did Jesus first appear to women in Matthew 28:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Rejoice_important_in_Matt_28_9.htm">What is the significance of the greeting "Rejoice" in Matthew 28:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_people_worship_jesus.htm">Did people worship Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'overcome_by_the_blood'_mean.htm">What were the teachings of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_1_cor_15_5-7_with_gospels.htm">How do we reconcile apparent inconsistencies between 1 Corinthians 15:5&#8211;7 and the various Gospel accounts of Jesus&#8217; resurrection appearances?

Now the women, according to our history, receive the reward of their faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail!</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">Rejoice ye!</span> This is not the usual Eastern salutation, "Peace be unto you!" but one that came with peculiar significance on their lately sorrow-stricken hearts. So he had said to his apostles, "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy" (<a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>), and now he made good his word. This is the only one of Christ's appearances in Jerusalem or its neighbourhood. that St. Matthew relates. <span class="cmt_word">They came and</span> <span class="cmt_word">held him by the feet</span> (<span class="accented">took hold of his feet</span>). As soon as they saw him, they went to him with glad surprise, and yet with such awe, that they could only fall down before him and tenderly clasp his feet. He had appeared before this to Mary Magdalene (<a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>), but had not permitted her to touch him because he had not yet ascended to the Father (<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), implying thereby either that she would have other opportunities of holding converse with him, as he was not going to leave the earth immediately, and she must not detain him now; or, more probably, that the spiritual body demanded, not the touch of earthly affection, but the attitude of awe and reverence, and that all future contact would be supernatural and spiritual, realizing his presence after a heavenly and supersensuous manner by faith. But these women clung to Christ with something higher than natural, earthly affection, acknowledging his superhumanity, and he allowed them, like Thomas, to assure themselves of his corporeity by touch as well as sight. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him.</span> They remained at his feet in profound adoration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Suddenly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">met</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#942;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hyp&#275;nt&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To meet, go to meet.
