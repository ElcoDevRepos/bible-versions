The distance suggests a separation between the main characters and the herd, which may symbolize the separation between the Jewish people and Gentile practices, as pigs were considered unclean in Jewish law.<p><b>a large herd of pigs</b><br>Pigs were considered unclean animals according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7-8</a>). The presence of a large herd of pigs indicates that this event is taking place in a Gentile region, likely the Decapolis, where Jewish dietary laws were not observed. This setting highlights the cultural and religious tensions between Jews and Gentiles. The large number of pigs also emphasizes the scale of the event and the potential economic impact on the local community, as pigs were valuable livestock for Gentiles.<p><b>was feeding</b><br>The act of feeding suggests a normal, everyday activity, which contrasts with the extraordinary events that are about to unfold. This mundane detail underscores the sudden and dramatic nature of the miracle that Jesus is about to perform. The feeding of the pigs can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment, contrasting the unclean nature of the pigs with the spiritual sustenance that Jesus offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Matthew, performing miracles and teaching with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gadara.htm">Gadara</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, often associated with Gentile territory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/demoniacs.htm">Demoniacs</a></b><br>Two men possessed by demons, living among the tombs, who encounter Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pigs.htm">Pigs</a></b><br>A large herd of pigs, significant in this account as they are unclean animals according to Jewish law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>Spiritual beings opposed to God, who recognize Jesus' authority and plead with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' authority is recognized by both the spiritual and physical realms.

Though near enough to see, the herd is far enough away that no one mistakes coincidence for providence; when the pigs later rush over the cliff (<a href="/mark/5-13.htm">Mark 5:13</a>), everyone recognizes divine causality rather than accidental stampede.<p>- Scripture often uses distance to underscore both safety and sovereignty: &#8220;While he was still a long way off&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), and &#8220;There shall be a space between you and it&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a>). Here, the gap underlines Christ&#8217;s control over the entire scene.<p>- The demons will beg to enter what they can see (<a href="/matthew/8-31.htm">Matthew 8:31</a>), proving they cannot act unless the Lord grants permission&#8212;echoing <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Large herd</b><p>- &#8220;Large&#8221; points to significant economic value. The local Gentile owners are prospering, yet moments later the whole investment will be lost, illustrating Jesus&#8217; teaching that &#8220;what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>- <a href="/mark/5-13.htm">Mark 5:13</a> numbers the pigs at about two thousand, tying the herd&#8217;s size to the &#8220;Legion&#8221; of demons (<a href="/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a>). The abundance of animals mirrors the abundance of evil spirits and magnifies Christ&#8217;s power when He expels them all at once.<p>- The scale also guarantees eyewitnesses; a few pigs might slip from memory, but a massive herd plunging into the sea becomes an unforgettable testimony (<a href="/luke/8-34.htm">Luke 8:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of pigs</b><p>- Swine are declared unclean in <a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>. Their presence signals a Gentile territory, reinforcing that Jesus&#8217; authority extends beyond Israel (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p>- Unclean spirits asking for unclean animals displays fitting irony; darkness gravitates toward what is ceremonially defiled. Yet Christ allows it, exposing evil&#8217;s nature without tainting Himself (<a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>).<p>- The link between pigs and spiritual want is seen again in <a href="/luke/15-15.htm">Luke 15:15-16</a>, where the prodigal son&#8217;s lowest moment comes among swine. Both scenes dramatize the misery of life apart from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was feeding</b><p>- The herd grazes peacefully, painting a calm backdrop before sudden destruction. Evil often lurks during apparent normalcy (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>).<p>- The verb reminds us that animals, like people, depend on daily provision from God (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27-28</a>). Even livestock destined to illustrate judgment enjoy His common grace until the appointed hour.<p>- When the pigs later rush headlong into the sea, their tranquil feeding contrasts with demonic chaos, validating Jesus&#8217; words that the thief &#8220;comes only to steal and kill and destroy&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/8-30.htm">Matthew 8:30</a> is more than scene-setting. Every phrase combines to show Christ&#8217;s absolute authority over distance, wealth, ritual uncleanness, and everyday life. A far-off, valuable, unclean, quietly feeding herd becomes the stage on which Jesus publicly exposes and overthrows a legion of demons, revealing both the seriousness of evil and the supremacy of the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">An herd of many swine.</span>--We are surprised at first to find swine kept in a country where their flesh could not be an article of food. But though the Jews did not eat pork, Roman soldiers did, and the swine may have been kept to supply the wants of the legion with which the man was familiar. The pun of Augustus as to Herod's swine and son (see Note on <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm" title="Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.">Matthew 2:16</a>) seems to imply that the king kept them on his estates for some such purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine feeding.

This is distinguished from ver. 29 as expressly the utterance of the evil spirits.

Further notice: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The unclean chose the unclean <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though we cannot attribute to the evil spirits absolute foreknowledge of what would happen in this case, their past experience may have enabled them to feel sure that they would have their love of destroying fully gratified. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is also not impossible that they may have considered that their entering the swine would be likely to prejudice the Gerasenes against Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In the distance</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(makran)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3112.htm">Strong's 3112: </a> </span><span class="str2">At a distance, far away, remote, alien.
