The term "denounce" indicates a strong rebuke or condemnation. This reflects the seriousness of the situation, as these cities had witnessed firsthand the power and authority of Jesus through His miracles. The act of denouncing suggests a judicial pronouncement, akin to a prophet declaring judgment upon a nation or city for its sins. This echoes the Old Testament prophets who often spoke against cities or nations that turned away from God.<p><b>in which most of His miracles had been performed</b><br>The cities referred to here are primarily Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, which were located in the region of Galilee. These cities were privileged to witness a significant number of Jesus' miracles, which served as signs of His divine authority and messianic identity. The miracles were not just acts of compassion but were intended to lead people to faith and repentance. The fact that "most" of His miracles were performed there underscores the abundance of evidence provided to these cities, making their unbelief and lack of repentance even more grievous.<p><b>because they did not repent</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in Jesus' teaching, calling for a change of heart and turning away from sin towards God. Despite witnessing numerous miracles, the people of these cities failed to respond with repentance. This highlights the hardness of their hearts and their unwillingness to accept Jesus as the Messiah. The call to repentance is consistent with the message of John the Baptist and the prophets before him, emphasizing the need for spiritual transformation. The lack of repentance in these cities serves as a warning about the consequences of rejecting the revelation and grace of God. This theme is echoed in other parts of the New Testament, where repentance is shown as essential for salvation and entering the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs miracles and calls for repentance.

As in the case of the passages common to both Evangelists in Matthew 10 and Luke 10, we need not assume that the former has compiled a discourse from fragments collected separately.

It is possible that St. Matthew or the author of the source used by him did not care to interrupt the subject of ch. 10. by inserting more of these verses there, even though that place more nearly represented their original position.
