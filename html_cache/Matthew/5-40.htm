The act of suing indicates a formal legal proceeding, often involving a grievance or debt. This phrase suggests a situation where an individual is being taken to court, reflecting the litigious nature of society at the time. The Mosaic Law provided guidelines for resolving disputes, and Jesus' teaching here challenges the conventional approach to justice by advocating for a response that transcends legalistic retribution.<p><b>and take your tunic</b><br>The tunic was a basic garment worn next to the skin, often made of linen or wool. It was an essential piece of clothing in ancient times, and losing it would leave a person with only their outer garment. The mention of the tunic highlights the seriousness of the lawsuit, as it involves taking something of personal necessity. This reflects the vulnerability of the individual being sued and underscores the radical nature of Jesus' teaching, which calls for a response that goes beyond mere compliance with legal demands.<p><b>let him have your cloak as well;</b><br>The cloak, or outer garment, was more than just clothing; it was also used as a blanket for warmth, especially for the poor who might not have other means of covering themselves at night. According to <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>, the cloak was considered so essential that it was protected by law, and a creditor was required to return it by sunset if taken as a pledge. Jesus' instruction to offer the cloak as well is a radical call to self-sacrifice and generosity, even at the cost of one's own comfort and security. This teaching aligns with the broader message of the Sermon on the Mount, which emphasizes love, mercy, and going beyond the letter of the law. It also reflects the example of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself fully for others, embodying the ultimate act of selflessness and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a collection of teachings that emphasize the values and ethics of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_and_the_crowd.htm">The Disciples and the Crowd</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teachings, representing both His close followers and the broader group of people interested in His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event in the New Testament where Jesus outlines the principles of His Kingdom, found in Matthew chapters 5-7.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/radical_generosity.htm">Radical Generosity</a></b><br>Jesus calls His followers to a standard of generosity that goes beyond legal obligations.

He anticipates situations where someone believes he can gain from us through the courts, echoing His earlier words, &#8220;But I tell you, do not resist an evil person&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Rather than defending personal pride, Christ calls His followers to examine the deeper issue: Am I willing to forgo my &#8220;rights&#8221; to display the kingdom&#8217;s values? Paul later asks the same in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>, urging believers to accept wrong rather than damage their witness through lawsuits.<p>&#8226; This approach does not deny real injustice; it redirects the believer&#8217;s primary concern from winning a case to winning a heart, as modeled by Jesus before Pilate (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And take your tunic</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;tunic&#8221; was a long inner garment, the basic layer of clothing. Its loss meant genuine discomfort, not a trivial inconvenience.<p>&#8226; Jesus highlights personal property that feels indispensable, reminding us of <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>, where God safeguarded a poor man&#8217;s cloak overnight. Here, however, He calls us beyond minimum compassion to radical trust.<p>&#8226; By mentioning the tunic, He acknowledges the legitimate claim the plaintiff might have, but He shifts the disciple&#8217;s focus from defending essentials to reflecting the Father&#8217;s generosity (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let him have your cloak as well</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;cloak&#8221; was the outer garment, valuable for warmth and legally protected from permanent confiscation. Offering it voluntarily goes beyond what any court could demand.<p>&#8226; Jesus invites us to proactive generosity:<p>&#8211; Outdo wrong with grace (<a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20-21</a>).<p>&#8211; Mirror the Savior who &#8220;though He was rich, yet for your sakes became poor&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Demonstrate that our security rests not in possessions but in God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Such surrender disarms hostility, much like turning the other cheek in the previous verse (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>). The goal is not passive victimhood but active love that may lead an opponent to repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a> calls believers to relinquish even legitimate claims when necessary, trading self-protection for Christlike generosity. By offering both tunic and cloak, we showcase the gospel: God freely gives beyond what justice requires, and His children gladly do the same.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">If any man will sue thee at the law.</span>--The Greek is somewhat stronger: <span class= "ital">If a man will go</span>--i.e., <span class= "ital">is bent on going</span>--<span class= "ital">to law with thee.</span> The verse presents another aspect of the same temper of forbearance. Not in regard to acts of violence only, but also in dealing with the petty litigation that disturbs so many men's peace, it is better to yield than to insist on rights. St. Paul gives the same counsel to the believers at Corinth: "Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?" (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?">1Corinthians 6:7</a>). Here also, of course, the precept, absolutely binding, as far as self-interest is concerned, may be traversed by higher considerations.<p><span class= "bld">Coat.</span>--The close-fitting tunic worn next the body.<p><span class= "bld">Cloke.</span>--The outer flowing mantle, the more costly garment of the two. (Comp. <a href="/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>, and the combination of the two words, in <a href="/acts/9-39.htm" title="Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.">Acts 9:39</a>, "coats and garments.") The meaning of the illustration is obvious. It is wise rather to surrender more than is demanded, than to disturb the calm of our own spirit by wrangling and debate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - The parallel passage, <a href="/luke/6-29.htm">Luke 6:29</a>b, gives the taking of the garments in the converse order. <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will sue thee</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and if any man would go to law with thee.</span> Notice that "will," "would" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), implies that the trial has not yet even begun.
