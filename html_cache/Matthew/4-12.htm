John's arrest fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where John is the "voice of one calling in the wilderness," preparing the way for the Lord. The imprisonment also highlights the political and religious tensions of the time, as John was arrested for condemning Herod's unlawful marriage. This event underscores the cost of prophetic truth-telling and foreshadows the opposition Jesus Himself will face.<p><b>He withdrew to Galilee</b><br>Jesus' withdrawal to Galilee is strategic and significant. Galilee, a region in northern Israel, was a fertile and populous area with a mix of Jewish and Gentile populations. This move fulfills <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light dawning in Galilee, a region often looked down upon by Judean Jews. By beginning His ministry in Galilee, Jesus aligns with God's plan to bring salvation to all, including the marginalized and those outside the religious epicenter of Jerusalem. This withdrawal is not out of fear but a deliberate step in His divine mission, setting the stage for His public ministry and the calling of His first disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who begins His public ministry following this event.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Christ, who has been imprisoned by Herod Antipas for his bold proclamation of truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel where Jesus begins His ministry, fulfilling prophecy and establishing His base of operations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Timing and Sovereignty</a></b><br>Jesus' withdrawal to Galilee demonstrates God's perfect timing and sovereignty in the unfolding of His redemptive plan.

His imprisonment meant:<p>&#8226; The forerunner&#8217;s public ministry had ended, confirming that the spotlight must now fall completely on Jesus (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p>&#8226; A sobering reminder that fidelity to truth invites opposition (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Proof that ungodly powers cannot thwart God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He withdrew</b><p>Matthew often notes Jesus withdrawing, yet never in cowardice.

Jesus, ever attentive to the Father&#8217;s timetable, reacts to John&#8217;s imprisonment not with alarm but with purposeful movement. The forerunner&#8217;s voice fades; the Messiah&#8217;s voice rises. Withdrawal safeguards the mission, and Galilee becomes the stage where prophecy meets reality. The verse quietly but powerfully affirms that God&#8217;s redemptive plan advances, unhindered by hostile rulers, guided by perfect wisdom, and directed toward needy people in dark places.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) Between the 11th and 12th verses there is a great break, and it is well to remember what passed in the interval: (1) the return to the Baptist, and the call of the six disciples (<a href="/context/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29-51</a>); (2) the marriage at Cana, and the visit to Capernaum (<a href="/context/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:">John 2:1-12</a>); (3) the cleansing of the Temple; the interview with Nicodemus, and the last testimony of the Baptist (<a href="/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a> to <a href="/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>). At this stage comes in the imprisonment of John (mentioned here, but not narrated till 14:3-5) and the consequent journey through Samaria to Galilee (<a href="/context/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1-42</a>). The verse now before us may be noted as implying a ministry in Judaea, which for some reason the writer does not narrate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-16.</span> - JESUS' WITHDRAWAL INTO GALILEE. (Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14, 15</a>.) According to some commentators, a new section begins here; but probably these verses are still preliminary. Our Lord's activity does not begin till ver. 17. But now he withdraws to Galilee, settling in Capernaum, thus fulfilling prophecy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when Jesus had heard</span>. If we had the synoptic Gospels alone, we should have supposed that the Baptist was imprisoned immediately after the end of our Lord's temptation (cf. this verse with <a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>); but St. John (<a href="/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>) expressly states that he had not been cast into prison when the events recorded in <a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43-3:23</a> took place. "For a time Christ and the Baptist worked side by side, preaching ' repentance' (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a> [also <a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>]) and baptizing [<a href="/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>]. The Messiah took up the position of a prophet in Judaea, as afterwards in Galilee" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22-24</a>). The events in Galilee related in <a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-12</a> were "preparatory to the manifestation at Jerusalem which was the real commencement of Christ's Messianic work. St. John records the course and issue of this manifestation: the other Evangelists start with the record of the Galilaean ministry, which dates from the imprisonment of the Baptist" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). He adds, on <a href="/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43</a>, "It seems probable that the earlier part of the synoptic narratives (<a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14 - 2:14</a>, and parallels) must be placed in the interval which extended from <a href="/john/4-43.htm">John 4:43-5:1</a>." Matthew alone states directly that the news of the Baptist having been taken by Herod was the motive of our Lord's withdrawal into Galilee. He says nothing to show whether our Lord withdrew because he would avoid a like treatment himself, or, as is on the whole more likely, because he did not wish to be mixed up in the tumults to which John's capture appears to have given rise (cf. <a href="/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was cast into prison;</span> "was delivered up" (Revised Version and Authorized Version margin); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, absolutely (cf. <a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>; <a href="/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>). If the more proper meaning of the word may be insisted on, the thought is of the person to whom John was committed rather than of the place; John being delivered up, that is to say, by Herod to his officials. But in usage it appears rather to mean only compulsory removal, loss of liberty. Mark (<a href="/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>) points out the temporary protection that the imprisonment gave to John against the resentment of Herodias. <span class="cmt_word">He departed</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he withdrew</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>,. A favourite word of St. Matthew's (ten times; Mark and John once each; Acts twice). It always implies some motive for the change of place, and is frequently used of departure directly consequent upon knowledge acquired. Hence it often implies a feeling of danger. Into Galilee; whence he had come (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13</a>). Hence "returned" (Luke). In Galilee he would still be in Herod's dominions; but, as being in his own home, he would not attract so much attention. N.B. - Between vers. 12 and 13 some place the incident of his preaching at Nazareth (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>); but ver. 23 of that passage assumes much previous work at Capernaum, and can therefore hardly be as early as this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
