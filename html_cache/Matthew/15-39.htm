In the context of <a href="/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>, Jesus had just performed the miracle of feeding the four thousand, demonstrating His compassion and divine provision. The dismissal of the crowds shows Jesus' awareness of the need for rest and transition to the next phase of His ministry. It reflects His authority and ability to manage large gatherings, a common occurrence in His ministry.<p><b>He got into the boat</b><br>The use of a boat was a practical means of transportation for Jesus and His disciples, given the geographical setting around the Sea of Galilee. Boats were essential for travel and fishing, a primary occupation in the region. This phrase also symbolizes transitions in Jesus' ministry, as He often used boat journeys to move between different areas, teaching and performing miracles along the way. The boat can be seen as a type of the Church, carrying the message of Christ across the waters of the world.<p><b>and went to the region of Magadan</b><br>The region of Magadan is mentioned only here in the New Testament, and its exact location is uncertain. Some manuscripts refer to it as Magdala, which is traditionally associated with Mary Magdalene. Magdala was a town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, known for its fishing industry. This movement to Magadan signifies Jesus' continued mission to reach different communities, emphasizing His itinerant ministry. The journey to Magadan also highlights the strategic nature of Jesus' travels, as He sought to spread His message throughout Galilee and beyond.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches the crowds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>Large groups of people who followed Jesus to hear His teachings and witness His miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>A common mode of transportation for Jesus and His disciples, often used to travel across the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region_of_magadan.htm">The Region of Magadan</a></b><br>A location on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, also referred to as Magdala in some manuscripts, known as the hometown of Mary Magdalene.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_rest_and_retreat.htm">The Importance of Rest and Retreat</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates the need for rest and retreat after ministering to the crowds.

The verse reminds believers to serve with compassion, maintain clear boundaries, and stay flexible for the next God-given assignment, trusting the literal and accurate record of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">Into the coasts of Magdala.</span>--The better MSS. give the reading Magadan. The narrative implies that it was on the western shore of the lake, and it is probably to be identified with the modern village of <span class= "ital">El Mejdel,</span> about three miles above <span class= "ital">Tabarieh</span> (Tiberias). The name would seem to be an altered form of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Migdol,</span> a tower. On the assumption that "Mary, called Magdalene," derived her name from a town of that name, we may think of our Lord's visit as having been in some way connected with her presence. It is clear that the company of devout women who ministered to Him could hardly have followed Him in the more distant journey to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and it was natural, if they did not, that they should have returned for a time to their homes. St. Mark gives Dalmanutha as the place where our Lord disembarked. This has been identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Ain-el-Barideh,</span> the "cold fountain," a glen which opens upon the lake about a mile from Magdala.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sent away the multitude.</span> Having supplied their spiritual and material wants. He wished to avoid all disturbance or collision with constituted authorities; and the people dispersed quietly, being less excitable than the inhabitants of Bethsaida, and not so well acquainted with the Messianic claims. The number thus dismissed was less than on the previous occasion, though the provision was greater - a difference which distinguishes one incident from the other, and which no forger would have introduced, it being much more natural to make the second wonder transcend, instead of falling short of, the previous one. We mention this here, because some critics have assumed that the present is only an imperfectly remembered account of the feeding of the five thousand already narrated. There are, of course, many points of similarity in the two incidents. Being of identical character, they must naturally present the same general features. But careful survey of the two narratives discloses many differences, which quite preclude the notion that the latter is a traditional reproduction of the former. To one who believes in the honesty and good faith of the evangelists, the allusion which Christ makes to the two miracles is a sufficient argument for their separation. Our Lord pointedly calls to mind the two occasions when he multiplied food, and rebukes the apostles for their lack of apprehension in the face of these marvels. "Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) ye took up?" (<a href="/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="/mark/8-19.htm">Mark 8:19-21</a>). Many of the essential points of difference between the two accounts are noticed in the Exposition, and they will be seen to dispart wherever divergence was possible, in time, scene, and detail. <span class="cmt_word">Magdala</span>. The right reading is most probably <span class="accented">Magadan</span>, or <span class="accented">Magedan</span> (Vulgate), the better known <span class="accented">Magdala</span> having at an early date been substituted for it. Conder identifies one of the two with a mud and stone village called <span class="accented">El Mejdel</span>, a little north of Tiberius, a poor place without any gardens, situated in a plain of partially arable soil. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] had dismissed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apolysas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_630.htm">Strong's 630: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and luo; to free fully, i.e. relieve, release, dismiss, or let die, pardon or divorce.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
