His role was to maintain order and enforce Roman law. Pilate's involvement in Jesus' trial highlights the intersection of Roman authority and Jewish leadership. Pilate's questioning of Jesus is significant as it demonstrates the legal proceedings of the time, where the accused would be given an opportunity to respond to charges. This moment also fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being delivered to the Gentiles (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Do You not hear</b><br>This phrase underscores the tension in the trial. Pilate is surprised by Jesus' silence in the face of serious accusations. In Roman trials, the accused typically defended themselves vigorously. Jesus' silence fulfills <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, which prophesies the Messiah would be oppressed and afflicted, yet not open His mouth. This silence is a testament to His submission to God's will and His role as the sacrificial Lamb.<p><b>how many charges they are bringing against You?&#8221;</b><br>The Jewish leaders accused Jesus of blasphemy, claiming He threatened to destroy the temple and claimed to be the King of the Jews, which they presented as a political threat to Roman authority. The multitude of charges reflects the leaders' desperation to ensure Jesus' condemnation. This moment is pivotal as it shows the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the rulers take counsel against the Lord and His Anointed.

Earlier, he had already questioned Jesus privately (<a href="/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33-38</a>) and declared, &#8220;I find no basis for a charge against Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). Yet the religious leaders refuse to relent. Their loud objections compel Pilate to reopen dialogue. His question shows he is torn between political pressure (<a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a>) and his awareness of Jesus&#8217; innocence (<a href="/matthew/27-18.htm">Matthew 27:18</a>). Like <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> warns, fear of man ensnares; Pilate&#8217;s words reveal that trap tightening.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do You not hear</b><p>Pilate is baffled by Jesus&#8217; silence. Only moments earlier, Jesus had spoken enough to affirm His kingship (<a href="/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11</a>), but now He chooses not to answer the piling accusations. This fulfills <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>: &#8220;He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth.&#8221; The Governor&#8217;s astonishment underscores that silence; most defendants would beg, bargain, or defend themselves (<a href="/mark/15-4.htm">Mark 15:4-5</a>). Jesus&#8217; restraint testifies to His willing submission to the Father&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how many charges</b><p>The phrase stresses quantity and intensity. The chief priests and elders hurl multiple, conflicting claims&#8212;sedition, blasphemy, forbidding taxes, claiming kingship (<a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>; <a href="/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>). None can stand scrutiny, but the barrage is designed to overwhelm. <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a> calls Satan &#8220;the accuser of our brothers,&#8221; and here his methods are mirrored: when truth fails, he multiplies lies. Yet <a href="/psalms/109-31.htm">Psalm 109:31</a> promises the Lord stands &#8220;at the right hand of the needy to save him from those who condemn his soul.&#8221; Jesus knows the outcome: every false charge will be nailed to the cross and canceled (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are bringing against You?</b><p>Pilate&#8217;s final phrase highlights the human source of the accusations&#8212;the religious elites&#8212;yet behind them stands a greater conflict (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>). Jesus&#8217; own people are &#8220;bringing&#8221; judgment, echoing <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>: &#8220;He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.&#8221; Still, Jesus will carry these very sins to Golgotha (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). While they present charges, He will present Himself as the spotless Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The irony is profound: their effort to condemn Him becomes God&#8217;s instrument to redeem them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-13.htm">Matthew 27:13</a> captures a tension-filled moment where Rome&#8217;s authority, Israel&#8217;s hostility, and heaven&#8217;s purpose intersect. Pilate&#8217;s puzzled question spotlights Jesus&#8217; silent resolve, fulfilling prophecy and modeling trust in the Father. The many charges reveal both human malice and the unseen spiritual battle, yet none of them stick because the Sinless One willingly bears them for us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearest thou not how many things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">quanta, what great things</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they witness against thee?</span> Among the charges was one that Jesus stirred up the people to revolt, both in Galilee and Judaea. The mention of Galilee offered to Pilate a chance of escaping the responsibility of the trial, and led to his sending Christ to Herod, as St. Luke relates (<a href="/luke/23-6.htm">Luke 23:6-12</a>). It was on the return from Herod that the final scene took place. Pilate evidently did not believe that this dignified, meek, inoffensive Man was guilty of sedition, and he desired to hear his defence, which he was willing to receive favourably (<a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
