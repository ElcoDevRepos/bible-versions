The context is important as it shows Jesus' active movement and engagement with the people, emphasizing His mission to seek and save the lost. The "there" refers to Capernaum, a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often considered His home base during His public ministry.<p><b>He saw a man named Matthew</b><br>Matthew, also known as Levi, is introduced here. He is traditionally understood to be the author of the Gospel of Matthew. His name means "gift of Yahweh," which is significant in the context of his calling and transformation. The act of Jesus seeing Matthew highlights Jesus' intentionality and divine insight, recognizing potential in those whom society often overlooked.<p><b>sitting at the tax booth</b><br>Matthew's occupation as a tax collector is crucial. Tax collectors were generally despised by the Jewish people for collaborating with the Roman authorities and often engaging in corrupt practices. This setting underscores the radical nature of Jesus' call, as He reaches out to someone considered a sinner and an outcast. The tax booth symbolizes Matthew's old life, which he is about to leave behind.<p><b>&#8220;Follow Me,&#8221; He told him</b><br>Jesus' call to "Follow Me" is a direct and personal invitation to discipleship. This command is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing obedience and commitment to Christ. It reflects the authority of Jesus and His ability to transform lives. The call to follow is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a complete change in direction and purpose.<p><b>and Matthew got up and followed Him</b><br>Matthew's immediate response demonstrates his willingness to leave his former life and embrace a new identity in Christ. This act of obedience is a model of faith and surrender, illustrating the transformative power of Jesus' call. It also signifies the beginning of Matthew's journey as one of the twelve apostles, who would later play a crucial role in spreading the Gospel. This response is echoed in other call narratives, such as those of Peter, Andrew, James, and John, who also left everything to follow Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who calls Matthew to follow Him.

And the sequence was probably, in part at least, one of cause and effect. The sympathy and power shown in healing the paralytic impressed itself on the mind of one who, as a publican, felt that he too had sins that needed to be forgiven.<p><span class= "bld">A man, named Matthew.</span>--St. Mark and St. Luke give the name as Levi, the former adds that he was the "son of Alphaeus." The difference may be explained by assuming that in his case, as in that of "Simon who is called (or named) Peter" (<a href="/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2</a>), a new name was given that practically superseded the old. The meaning of Matthew--which, like Theodore, Dorotheus, and the like, means "the gift of God," or, more strictly, "the gift of Jehovah"--makes a change of this kind in itself probable. If he were the son of Alphaeus, he would be (assuming identity of person and of name) the brother of the James whose name appears with his own in the second group of four in the lists of the Twelve Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Sitting at the receipt of custom.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">at the custom-house,</span> the <span class= "ital">douane</span> of the lake. The customs levied there were probably of the nature of an <span class= "ital">octroi</span> on the fish, fruit, and other produce that made up the exports and imports of Capernaum.<p><span class= "bld">And he saith unto him, Follow me.</span>--St. Mark (<a href="/mark/2-13.htm" title="And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.">Mark 2:13</a>) makes the call follow close upon an unrecorded discourse addressed to the whole multitude of Capernaum. In the nature of the case it was probable that there had been, as in the analogous call of the sons of Jona and Zebedee, a preparation of some kind. A brother had been converted, his own heart had been touched, he had felt (see Note on <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>) the presence of the new Teacher as light in the shadow of death.<p><span class= "bld">He arose, and followed him.</span>--St. Luke adds, "he left all."
