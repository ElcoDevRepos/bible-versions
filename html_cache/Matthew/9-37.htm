This moment is part of a larger narrative where Jesus is actively teaching and performing miracles, demonstrating His authority and compassion. The disciples are being trained to continue His work, and this statement is a direct call to them, emphasizing their role in the mission field. The context here is crucial as it highlights the transition from Jesus' personal ministry to the broader mission of the Church.<p><b>The harvest is plentiful</b><br>The metaphor of the harvest is rich with Old Testament imagery, often used to describe God's gathering of His people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>). In an agrarian society, the harvest represents a time of abundance and fulfillment. Spiritually, it signifies the readiness of people to receive the Gospel. Jesus is indicating that there is a vast number of people prepared to hear and accept the message of the Kingdom. This phrase underscores the urgency and opportunity present in Jesus' ministry and the ongoing mission of the Church.<p><b>But the workers are few</b><br>This phrase highlights a critical issue: the lack of sufficient laborers to gather the spiritual harvest. Historically, this reflects the small number of Jesus' followers at the time compared to the vast population needing to hear the Gospel. It also serves as a call to action for believers to engage in evangelism and discipleship. The scarcity of workers is a recurring theme in the New Testament, urging the Church to pray for and raise up more laborers (see <a href="/luke/10-2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>). This shortage emphasizes the need for commitment and dedication among Jesus' followers to fulfill the Great Commission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples.

It is not enough for Him to feel compassion Himself. He craves the sympathy of His companions and disciples, and needs even their fellowship in prayer. A great want lies before Him, and He sees that they are the right agents to meet it, if only they will pray to be made so; or, to put the case more clearly, if only they will pray that the work <span class= "ital">may be done,</span> whether they themselves are or are not the doers of it.<p><span class= "bld">The harvest truly is plenteous.</span>--This is the first occurrence in the record of the first three Gospels of the figure which was afterwards to be expanded in the two parables of the Sower and the Tares, and to reappear in the visions of the Apocalypse (<a href="/context/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14-19</a>). We find, however, from the Gospel of St. John--which here, as so often elsewhere, supplies missing links and the germs of thoughts afterwards developed--that it was not a new similitude in our Lord's teaching. Once before, among the alien Samaritans, He had seen the fields white as for the spiritual harvest of the souls of men, and had spoken of him that soweth and him that reapeth (<a href="/context/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35-36</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - The utterance is given word for word (except one transposition) at the beginning of the address to the seventy in <a href="/luke/10-2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>. But while serving there as an introduction to the rest of the speech, the reason for it is so much more self-evident here that St. Matthew seems to have recorded it in its original connexion. Our Lord himself, feeling the shepherdless condition of the people, desires to call out the interest of his disciples in it. He wants them to realize both the need of the people and the possibility that lay before the workmen. Changing the metaphor, he bids them pray him, who alone has the right and power, to send more workmen to reap these fields. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest</span> - of human souls (<a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35-38</a>).
