This approach not only challenges the questioners but also reveals their intentions. By asking a question in return, Jesus places the religious leaders in a position where they must confront their own understanding and motives.<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>The context here is Jesus' interaction with the chief priests and elders in the temple courts. His response is significant as it demonstrates His wisdom and authority. Jesus often used parables and questions to teach profound truths, and His replies were always purposeful, aiming to reveal deeper spiritual insights.<p><b>and if you answer Me,</b><br>This conditional statement sets the stage for a test of integrity and discernment. Jesus is not merely engaging in a debate; He is inviting the leaders to reflect on their own beliefs and the implications of their answer. It highlights the importance of truthfulness and the willingness to acknowledge divine authority.<p><b>I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</b><br>The phrase "these things" refers to Jesus' actions in the temple, including the cleansing of the temple and His teachings. The question of authority is central to the narrative, as it challenges the religious leaders' understanding of divine authority versus human authority. Jesus' authority is rooted in His identity as the Son of God, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and typologies of the Messiah.

He frames the entire exchange with a single, targeted question, underscoring both the gravity of what has just happened in the temple (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>) and His desire for an honest dialogue.<p>- One deliberate question cuts through any attempt at evasive debate, much as He later does with &#8220;Whose likeness is this?&#8221; regarding the denarius (<a href="/matthew/22-20.htm">Matthew 22:20</a>).<p>- Throughout Scripture the Lord often uses a single piercing inquiry to expose the heart&#8212;think of God&#8217;s &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; to Adam (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>) or Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>).<p>- <a href="/mark/11-29.htm">Mark 11:29-30</a> parallels this scene, confirming that Jesus&#8217; approach is purposeful and consistent across the Gospel accounts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus replied</b><p>The chief priests and elders have demanded, &#8220;By what authority are You doing these things?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23</a>). Jesus&#8217; response is not evasive; it is strategic.<p>- As <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a> foretells, Messiah &#8220;will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth,&#8221; and here His measured words hold spiritual authority that unsettles His opponents.<p>- <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a> notes that when reviled, Jesus &#8220;entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly,&#8221; a posture reflected in this calm yet firm reply.<p>- His answer demonstrates the wisdom urged in <a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4-5</a>&#8212;He neither sinks to foolish argument nor allows falsehood to stand unchallenged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if you answer Me</b><p>A condition is introduced.

Revelation follows reception.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a> offers the same pattern: &#8220;Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD confides in those who fear Him,&#8221; indicating that divine insight is relational, not merely informational.<p>- <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a> likewise records Jesus saying, &#8220;I have called you friends, for everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by what authority I am doing these things</b><p>The issue is authority&#8212;specifically divine authority.<p>- <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a> later records Jesus declaring, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me,&#8221; confirming what He withholds here until hearts are ready.<p>- <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-27</a> shows the Son acting only in perfect unity with the Father, grounding His temple cleansing, teaching, and miracles in heavenly commissioning.<p>- <a href="/acts/4-7.htm">Acts 4:7</a> features the Sanhedrin asking Peter and John the very same question, proving this struggle over authority continues beyond the Gospels.<p>- &#8220;These things&#8221; points back to His righteous disruption in the temple and His teaching that challenged religious commerce and hypocrisy (<a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/matthew/21-24.htm">Matthew 21:24</a> Jesus masterfully redirects a hostile interrogation into a heart-searching moment. One incisive question exposes motives, sets conditions for further revelation, and highlights the true issue: divine authority embodied in the Messiah. The passage reminds readers that honest engagement with God&#8217;s truth is a prerequisite for deeper understanding, and that Jesus stands ready to disclose more to those who respond in faith and integrity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">I also will ask you one thing.</span>--The question is met by another question. As One who taught as "having authority, and not as the scribes" (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm" title="For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.">Matthew 7:29</a>), He challenges their right to interrogate Him on the ground of precedent. Had they exercised that right in the case of the Baptist, and if so, with what result? If they had left his claim unquestioned, or if they had shrunk from confessing the result of their inquiry, they had virtually abdicated their office, and had no right, in logical consistency, to exercise it, as by fits and starts, in the case of another teacher.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I also will ask you one thing;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">one word, question</span>. Jesus does not reply directly to their insidious demand. He might have asserted his Divine mission, and appealed to his miracles in confirmation of such claim, which would have been in strict conformity with the old, established rule for discriminating false and true prophets (see <a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>); but he knew too well their scepticism and malice and inveterate prejudice to lay stress on this allegation at the present moment. Before he satisfied their inquiry, he must have their opinion concerning one whom they had received as a prophet a few years ago, and whose memory was still held in the highest respect, John the Baptist. The manner in which they regarded him and his testimony would enable them to answer their own interrogation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I will also ask</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Er&#333;t&#275;s&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2065.htm">Strong's 2065: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apparently from ereo; to interrogate; by implication, to request.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
