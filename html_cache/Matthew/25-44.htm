It highlights the finality of judgment and the accountability of all individuals. The use of "too" suggests a parallel with the righteous, emphasizing that both groups are given a chance to respond to the King.<p><b>&#8216;Lord, when did we see You</b><br>The address "Lord" signifies recognition of authority, yet it is ironic because their actions did not align with their acknowledgment. This reflects a common biblical theme where people profess faith but lack corresponding deeds (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>). The question implies ignorance or denial of their failure to act.<p><b>hungry or thirsty</b><br>These basic human needs are often used in Scripture to symbolize spiritual needs as well (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>). The failure to meet these needs in others is a failure to recognize Christ in them, as He identifies with the least of these.<p><b>or a stranger</b><br>Hospitality was a significant cultural value in ancient Near Eastern societies. The failure to welcome strangers contradicts the biblical mandate to love the foreigner (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>). This reflects a lack of compassion and understanding of God's inclusive love.<p><b>or naked</b><br>Providing clothing is a basic act of charity and dignity. In biblical times, clothing was a sign of status and identity. The failure to clothe the naked is symbolic of neglecting to restore dignity and identity to those in need (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>).<p><b>or sick</b><br>Caring for the sick is a tangible expression of mercy and compassion. In the Gospels, Jesus frequently healed the sick, demonstrating the kingdom of God's power and compassion (<a href="/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>). Ignoring the sick is a failure to emulate Christ's ministry.<p><b>or in prison</b><br>Visiting prisoners was a recognized act of mercy in Jewish tradition. Prisons in biblical times were often places of severe hardship. The call to visit prisoners reflects God's concern for justice and mercy (<a href="/hebrews/13-3.htm">Hebrews 13:3</a>).<p><b>and did not minister to You?&#8217;</b><br>The word "minister" implies service and care, which are central to Christian discipleship (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The failure to minister to those in need is equated with failing to minister to Christ Himself, underscoring the intimate connection between love for God and love for neighbor (1 <a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep_and_the_goats.htm">The Sheep and the Goats</a></b><br>This parable, told by Jesus, is about the final judgment where people are separated like a shepherd separates sheep from goats.

Men thought that they were only neglecting their fellow men, and were, it may be, thinking that they had wronged no man. It is significant that the sins here are, all of them, sins of omission. As in the case of the parable of the Talents, the opportunities (here those that are common to all men, as there those that attached to some office or ministry in the Church) have simply not been used.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall they also answer</span> [<span class="cmt_word">him</span>]. Not in words, for at that time objection and expostulation would not be allowed, but in thought, "standing at the judgment seat, yet ceasing not to sin." There is a certain self-confidence in their reply, very different from the humility and misgiving of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">When saw we thee</span>, etc.? They put all these neglected duties in a careless summary. They had never thought of Christ in the matter: were they to be condemned for this? Some had never even heard of Christ, never been taught faith in him: was this their fault? This is the line which their self-justification took; there was nothing of love, nothing of humility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
