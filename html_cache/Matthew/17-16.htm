The disciples had previously been given authority to cast out demons and heal diseases (<a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>), which makes their inability in this instance noteworthy. This reflects the importance of faith and reliance on God&#8217;s power rather than human ability. The act of bringing the boy to the disciples also highlights the communal aspect of ministry and the expectation that Jesus' followers would carry on His work.<p><b>but they could not heal him.</b><br>The disciples' failure to heal the boy underscores a moment of spiritual weakness or lack of faith, as Jesus later points out in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>. This incident serves as a teaching moment about the necessity of faith and prayer (<a href="/mark/9-29.htm">Mark 9:29</a>). It also foreshadows the greater works that Jesus would accomplish, emphasizing His unique authority and power. The inability to heal contrasts with Jesus' consistent success in performing miracles, reinforcing His divine nature and the need for His followers to remain connected to Him.

Although the disciples had been empowered, their failure highlights the necessity of active, prayer-saturated faith.

The scribes were taunting the disciples, who had probably trusted to their use of the wonted formula of their Master's name, and were now wrangling in their own defence. Neither scribes nor disciples had thought of gaining the spiritual power which might avail by the means which they both recognised as effective.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I brought him to thy disciples.</span> He had come with the multitude, hoping to find Jesus, and, being disappointed, he had applied to the nine to relieve his misery. When the apostles were sent forth with commission to heal the sick, they returned with joy to report the success of their tour: they cast forth many devils; they noted with glad surprise that the very demons were subject to them in the Name of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href="/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17</a>). It was different now. <span class="cmt_word">They could not cure him.</span> What means they used we know not; at any rate, they were ineffectual. The writers who record the failure must be allowed to be truthful and honest. There had been much to depress these disciples. Their Master was absent, gone they knew not whither; how long he would be away they could not tell; the boldest and most trusted of their company were no longer present to cheer them with sympathy, to repel attacks, to stand forth as champions. The scribes' uncompromising disbelief (<a href="/mark/9-16.htm">Mark 9:16</a>) had for the moment obscured their own perfect trust; the atmosphere of infidelity had affected their own breathing; the memory of Christ's words concerning his Passion and death recurred again with dispiriting effect, infusing doubt and disquiet; they bad for the time lost the ardour and confidence which had animated them in their first mission; retaining belief in Christ's claims, they felt a hesitation concerning their own ability; and the conscious weakness in their exorcism nullified its power, and they could do no mighty work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I brought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#942;&#957;&#949;&#947;&#954;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(pros&#275;nenka)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4374.htm">Strong's 4374: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and phero; to bear towards, i.e. Lead to, tender, treat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
