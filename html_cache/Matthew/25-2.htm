The term "foolish" in biblical context often denotes a lack of spiritual insight or discernment (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of wisdom versus folly, where folly is associated with ignoring God's commandments and wisdom with obedience and preparedness (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The foolish virgins' lack of preparation can be seen as a warning against complacency in one's spiritual life, emphasizing the need for vigilance and readiness for the Second Coming of Christ.<p><b>and five were wise</b><br>The "wise" virgins, in contrast, are those who are prepared and ready for the bridegroom's arrival. Wisdom in the Bible is frequently linked to the fear of the Lord and living according to His will (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>). The wise virgins' preparedness is a metaphor for spiritual readiness and faithfulness, highlighting the importance of living a life that is in alignment with God's expectations. This distinction between the wise and foolish virgins echoes the teachings of Jesus in other parables, such as the wise and foolish builders (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>), where wisdom is equated with hearing and acting upon Jesus' words. The wise virgins' actions serve as an encouragement to believers to remain steadfast and vigilant in their faith, anticipating Christ's return with joy and expectation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_virgins.htm">The Ten Virgins</a></b><br>These are the central figures in the parable. They represent believers who are awaiting the return of Christ, symbolized by the bridegroom. The ten virgins are divided into two groups: wise and foolish.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>This figure represents Jesus Christ, whose return is anticipated by the virgins.

The number ten pictures completeness, reminding us of the whole visible community awaiting Christ&#8217;s return, much like the wheat and tares grow together until the harvest (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Splitting the group in half signals that outward association with believers does not guarantee inward readiness; Jesus also warned that &#8220;many&#8221; who say &#8220;Lord, Lord&#8221; will hear, &#8220;I never knew you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores personal responsibility. No one can borrow another&#8217;s faith (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>); each person must stand before God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were foolish</b><p>&#8226; Scripture calls someone foolish when he neglects God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). These virgins carried lamps yet failed to take oil (<a href="/matthew/25-3.htm">Matthew 25:3</a>), symbolizing a profession without regeneration&#8212;works without the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their folly was not ignorance of Christ&#8217;s coming but indifference to preparation, echoing the man who built on sand, hearing but not doing Christ&#8217;s words (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual complacency appears harmless until crisis exposes it. At midnight the shout came, and the foolish found their lamps sputtering; likewise, sudden judgment will catch the unprepared off guard (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And five were wise</b><p>&#8226; Wisdom in Scripture is living in reverent obedience (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The wise virgins took oil in jars (<a href="/matthew/25-4.htm">Matthew 25:4</a>), illustrating a heart indwelt by the Spirit and sustained by ongoing fellowship with Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Their foresight mirrors the prudent builder whose house withstood the storm because it rested on the Rock (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>). True wisdom counts the cost, endures in faith, and perseveres to the end (<a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36-39</a>).<p>&#8226; When the Bridegroom arrived, the prepared entered the wedding banquet (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>). Wisdom, therefore, is rewarded with intimate, everlasting joy in Christ&#8217;s presence (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-2.htm">Matthew 25:2</a> draws a sharp line within a seemingly united crowd: half ready, half not. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; Mere association with believers is not enough; personal preparedness is essential.<p>&#8226; Folly dismisses the need for continual dependence on the Spirit, leaving one empty when the Lord appears.<p>&#8226; Wisdom actively trusts and obeys Christ, storing &#8220;oil&#8221; through a genuine, persevering relationship with Him.<p>The Bridegroom is coming; may we be found among the wise, lamps trimmed and hearts full of His life-giving oil.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Five of them were wise.</span>--The word is the same as in <a href="/matthew/24-45.htm" title="Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?">Matthew 24:45</a>, where see Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five of them were wise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and five were foolish.</span> The best uncials (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, D, L) invert the clauses, in agreement with the order in vers. 3, 4. So the Vulgate. In this case the idea would be that the foolish were a more prominent and noticeable class than the others. All the virgins were outwardly the same, were provided with the same lamps, prepared to perform the same office; the difference in their characters is proved by the result. Their folly is seen in the fact that at the time of action they were unable to do the part which a little care and forethought would have enabled them to perform successfully. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Five</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(pente)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4002.htm">Strong's 4002: </a> </span><span class="str2">Five.
