The context is a conversation with the religious leaders, who are being challenged to consider their own actions in light of God's will. The parable involves two sons, one who initially refuses to work in the vineyard but later repents and goes, and another who agrees to go but does not. This reflects the broader biblical theme of true obedience being demonstrated through actions rather than mere words, as seen in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>.<p><b>&#8220;The first,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>The religious leaders correctly identify the son who ultimately did the will of his father, highlighting their understanding of the principle that actions speak louder than words. This acknowledgment sets the stage for Jesus to confront them with their own failure to act on their professed beliefs. The response also underscores the importance of repentance and change, a recurring theme in the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>Jesus said to them, &#8220;Truly I tell you,</b><br>The phrase "Truly I tell you" (or "Amen, I say to you" in some translations) is a solemn affirmation used by Jesus to emphasize the truth and importance of what follows. It is a call to pay close attention, as Jesus is about to deliver a significant and perhaps unexpected message. This phrase is used frequently in the Gospels to introduce teachings that challenge conventional wisdom or religious norms.<p><b>the tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.</b><br>This statement would have been shocking to Jesus' audience, as tax collectors and prostitutes were considered sinners and outcasts in Jewish society. By stating that these individuals are entering the kingdom of God before the religious leaders, Jesus highlights the power of repentance and faith over mere religious status or outward piety. This echoes the message of John the Baptist, who called for repentance and prepared the way for Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3:1-2</a>). It also aligns with the prophetic tradition of God valuing a contrite heart over ritual sacrifice, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>.

They who gave God thanks that they were not like other men, could not imagine for an instant that the "went not" represented their spiritual life in relation to God's kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">The publicans and the harlots.</span>--The words are purposely general, as describing the action of classes; but we cannot help associating them with the personal instances of the publican who became an Apostle (9:9), and of Zacchaeus (<a href="/context/luke/19-2.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.">Luke 19:2-10</a>), and of the woman that was a sinner (<a href="/context/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37-50</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Go into the kingdom of God before you.</span>--Which literally means, <span class= "ital">lead the way into.</span> What follows shows that our Lord is stating not so much a law of God's government as a simple fact.

We must remark that the Lord has no censure for those who sometime were disobedient, but afterwards repented; his rebuke falls on the professors and self-righteous, who ought to have been leaders and guides, and were in truth impious and irreligious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
