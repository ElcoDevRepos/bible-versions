Jerusalem is the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple. This journey is significant as it marks the final approach to the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. The journey to Jerusalem is a fulfillment of Jesus' mission and aligns with Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's suffering and sacrifice (Isaiah 53). The ascent to Jerusalem is symbolic of Jesus' obedience to the Father's will, despite knowing the suffering that awaits Him.<p><b>He took the twelve disciples aside</b><br>Jesus often took His disciples aside to teach them privately, indicating the importance of the message He was about to share. The twelve disciples represent the foundation of the early Church, and their understanding of Jesus' mission is crucial for the spread of the Gospel. This private setting underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples and highlights the importance of preparing them for the events to come. It also reflects the pattern of rabbinic teaching, where a rabbi would instruct his closest followers in private.<p><b>and said</b><br>The act of speaking here is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' role as a teacher and prophet. His words are authoritative and prophetic, often revealing truths about His identity and mission. In this context, Jesus is about to predict His suffering, death, and resurrection, which is a central theme in the Gospels.

This would seem to have been followed by a return to Persea, and then the journey to Jerusalem begins. The account in St. Mark adds some significant facts. "Jesus went" (literally, <span class= "ital">was going</span>--implying continuance) "before them." It was as though the burden of the work on which He was entering pressed heavily on His soul. The shadow of the cross had fallen on Him. He felt something of the conflict which reached its full intensity in Gethsemane, and therefore He needed solitude that He might prepare Himself for the sacrifice by communing with His Father; and instead of journeying with the disciples and holding "sweet converse" with them, went on silently in advance. This departure from His usual custom, and, it may be, the look and manner that accompanied it, impressed the disciples, as was natural, very painfully. "They were amazed, and as they followed, were afraid." It was apparently as explaining what had thus perplexed them that He took the Twelve apart from the others that followed (including probably the Seventy and the company of devout women of <a href="/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2</a>) and told them of the nearness of His passion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19</span> - <span class="accented">Third and fuller prediction of Jesus</span> <span class="accented">sufferings and death</span>.
