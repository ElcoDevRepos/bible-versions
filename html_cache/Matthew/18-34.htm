Throughout Scripture, God's anger is often depicted as a response to sin and injustice (e.g., <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). This anger is not capricious but is a measured response to the servant's failure to show mercy, mirroring the divine expectation of forgiveness as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>.<p><b>his master</b><br>The master in this parable represents God, who is sovereign and just. The relationship between master and servant is a common biblical motif illustrating God's authority over humanity. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where masters had significant control over their servants, paralleling God's ultimate authority over creation.<p><b>turned him over to the jailers</b><br>The act of turning the servant over to the jailers signifies the consequences of unrepentant sin. In biblical times, jailers were responsible for enforcing punishment, often in harsh conditions. This imagery underscores the severity of divine judgment for those who fail to extend the grace they have received.<p><b>to be tortured</b><br>Torture here symbolizes the spiritual and emotional torment resulting from separation from God's grace. It reflects the severe consequences of unforgiveness, as seen in the broader biblical narrative where sin leads to suffering and alienation from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p><b>until he should repay all that he owed</b><br>This phrase highlights the impossibility of repaying the debt, symbolizing the insurmountable debt of sin that humanity owes to God. It echoes the earlier part of the parable where the servant's debt was forgiven, emphasizing the necessity of grace and the futility of attempting to earn salvation through works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Theologically, it points to the need for Christ's atoning sacrifice, as only through Him can the debt of sin be truly settled.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unforgiving_servant.htm">The Unforgiving Servant</a></b><br>This parable character is central to the teaching of <a href="/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>.

Having lavished mercy on the servant, the master&#8217;s anger is stirred by the servant&#8217;s refusal to extend that same mercy (<a href="/matthew/18-28.htm">Matthew 18:28-30</a>). <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a> reminds us that wrath is God&#8217;s settled opposition to sin. Mercy spurned invites judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his master</b><p>The master in the parable pictures God Himself (<a href="/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23</a>). As Creator and King (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>), He possesses absolute authority over every servant. <a href="/luke/7-41.htm">Luke 7:41-42</a> shows another picture of a creditor who forgives, reinforcing that God freely cancels debt yet still owns the right to call every account to order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>turned him over</b><p>Judgment is not accidental; it is intentional. <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a> describes how God &#8220;gave them over&#8221; when people persisted in sin. Likewise, <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a> warns, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God&#8221;. The servant is handed to consequences he has chosen by his hard heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the jailers</b><p>The &#8220;jailers&#8221; (or tormentors) point to confinement and custody. Jesus elsewhere speaks of imprisonment for unsettled accounts (<a href="/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58-59</a>). Second Peter 2:4 notes that God &#8220;delivered [angels] to chains of darkness.&#8221; The picture is one of inescapable restraint&#8212;no more freedom to misuse mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be tortured</b><p>Judgment is painful, not merely restrictive. <a href="/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23-24</a> records the rich man &#8220;in torment,&#8221; begging for relief. <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10-11</a> describes smoke of torment rising forever for those who reject God&#8217;s grace. The severity here underscores how seriously God views unforgiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until he should repay</b><p>Jesus borrows courtroom language (compare <a href="/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a>) to show duration. The debt is so enormous that repayment is impossible; the phrase therefore signals an unending sentence. <a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7-8</a> admits, &#8220;No man can redeem his brother&#8230; the redemption of his soul is costly.&#8221; Only divine pardon can settle the ledger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all that he owed</b><p>The servant&#8217;s entire obligation comes back on his own head. Our &#8220;debt&#8221; is sin (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>), an amount we could never cover. <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a> celebrates that Jesus &#8220;canceled the record of debt&#8230; nailing it to the cross,&#8221; but that cancellation applies only to those who, in turn, forgive others (<a href="/matthew/18-35.htm">Matthew 18:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a> teaches that rejecting God&#8217;s mercy by withholding forgiveness invites God&#8217;s righteous wrath. The Master who once released the servant&#8217;s impossible debt now enforces full payment, illustrating the unpayable cost of sin apart from grace. Genuine recipients of divine forgiveness will reflect that same forgiveness to others; failure to do so places a person under severe, even eternal, judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Delivered him to the tormentors.</span>--The words seem deliberately vague. We dare not say that the "tormentors" are avenging angels, or demons, though in the hell of mediaeval poetry and art these latter are almost exclusively represented as the instruments of punishment. More truly, we may see in them the symbols of whatever agencies God employs in the work of righteous retribution, the stings of remorse, the scourge of conscience, the scorn and reproach of men, not excluding, of course, whatever elements of suffering lie behind the veil, in the life beyond the grave.<p><span class= "bld">Till he should pay all that was due unto him.</span>--As in <a href="/matthew/5-26.htm" title="Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out there, till you have paid the uttermost farthing.">Matthew 5:26</a> (where see Note), the words suggest at once the possibility of a limit, and the difficulty, if not impossibility, of ever reaching it. How could the man in the hands of the tormentors obtain the means of paying the ten thousand talents? And the parable excludes the thought of the debt being, as it were, taken out in torments, a quantitative punishment being accepted as the discharge of what could not otherwise be paid. The imagery of the parable leaves us in silent awe, and we only find refuge from our questionings in the thought that "the things that are impossible with man are possible with God" (<a href="/matthew/19-26.htm" title="But Jesus beheld them, and said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.">Matthew 19:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was wroth.</span> This, as we said above, is the prerogative of God.

These are not the gaolers, prison keepers, but persons who put prisoners to the torture. Neither Jewish nor Roman law at that time recognized any such officials; neither were those in confinement treated thus in either community. The idea is taken from the practice of Oriental despotism, which might thus punish an offence considered supremely detestable. In a mystical sense these are the ministers of Divine vengeance who carry out the behests of the King. <span class="cmt_word">Till he should pay;</span> <span class="accented">until he should have paid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Some editors omit or bracket <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but the sense is the same with or without the relative. The debt never could be paid, so practically the punishment would last forever. Commentators, mediaeval and modern, see here an argument for the eternity of future punishment; others see in the clause an intimation that sin may be forgiven in the other world, though not repented of or pardoned in this present life. The words give no support to the latter interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Until</span>, etc., does not necessarily signify that the condition specified is certain to be fulfilled. As Bengel says, on <a href="/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>, "Non sequitur ergo post." And in the present case there could be no possibility of payment. A criminal delivered to the tormentors would have no opportunity or means of raising the necessary funds. If this is a picture of the final judgment, it is parallel to our Lord's statement in <a href="/matthew/5-26.htm">Matthew 5:26</a>, "Thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing;" for, as the Preacher says, "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All that was due</span> [<span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span>] (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Modern editors reject <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">universum debitum</span>. This is more general than "all that debt" in ver. 32. It is usually taken to refer to the old debt now redemanded. But a difficulty has been found in the fact that this old debt had been freely forgiven and utterly done away, and therefore could not, in equity, be again exacted. Hence some commentators have explained the clause as referring not at all to the former debt, but to a new debt incurred by a new offence, viz. ingratitude and unmercifulness. But the spiritual truth seems to be that, although sins once absolutely forgiven are not again imputed, they make subsequent sins more heinous, as in a human law court previous conviction increases the penalty of a fresh transgression. Falling from grace, a man passes into enmity with God, and so far cancels his pardon, and is in a state of condemnation (see <a href="/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24, 26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In his anger,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(orgistheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3710.htm">Strong's 3710: </a> </span><span class="str2">To irritate, provoke, be angry.
