This imagery aligns with Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah as a kingly figure (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>). The title "King" emphasizes His authority and sovereignty, which is a central theme in the Gospel of Matthew, highlighting Jesus as the fulfillment of the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>Truly I tell you</b><br>This phrase is a solemn affirmation used by Jesus to underscore the truth and importance of His statement. It is akin to the Hebrew "Amen," which signifies certainty and reliability. Jesus often uses this phrase to introduce significant teachings, indicating that what follows is of utmost importance and should be heeded carefully.<p><b>whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine</b><br>"The least of these" refers to those who are marginalized, vulnerable, or in need. In the cultural context of the time, this would include the poor, the sick, and the socially outcast. "Brothers of Mine" suggests a familial relationship, indicating that these individuals are part of the community of believers. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of God's concern for the poor and needy, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> and <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>. It also reflects the early Christian community's emphasis on caring for one another (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>you did for Me</b><br>This statement reveals the profound identification of Jesus with His followers. Acts of kindness and service to others are seen as acts done directly to Christ Himself. This concept is rooted in the idea of the Church as the Body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>), where believers are interconnected with Christ as the head. It underscores the incarnational aspect of Jesus' ministry, where He is present in the lives of His followers and the world. This teaching challenges believers to see Christ in every person and to serve others as they would serve Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who is depicted as the sovereign judge in this parable.
