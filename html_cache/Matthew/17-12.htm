In the context of <a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17</a>, Jesus is speaking to His disciples after the Transfiguration, where they had seen Elijah with Moses. The reference to Elijah having already come is understood to mean John the Baptist, who came in the "spirit and power of Elijah" (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>). This connection is significant because it highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the role of John the Baptist as the forerunner to the Messiah, preparing the way for Jesus.<p><b>and they did not recognize him</b><br>The failure to recognize Elijah in the form of John the Baptist reflects the spiritual blindness of the religious leaders and many of the people of Israel. Despite John's powerful ministry and clear message of repentance, he was not accepted by the religious establishment. This lack of recognition is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus Himself is often not recognized as the Messiah by those who were expecting a different kind of deliverer. This phrase underscores the importance of spiritual discernment and openness to God's unfolding plan.<p><b>but have done to him whatever they wished</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the mistreatment and eventual execution of John the Baptist. Herod Antipas, influenced by Herodias, had John imprisoned and later beheaded (<a href="/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3-12</a>). The phrase "whatever they wished" indicates the extent of the rejection and hostility faced by God's messengers. It serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of prophetic ministry and the opposition that often accompanies the proclamation of truth.<p><b>In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.</b><br>Here, Jesus draws a parallel between the fate of John the Baptist and His own impending suffering. The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term that Jesus frequently uses for Himself, emphasizing both His humanity and His divine authority (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>). This prediction of suffering foreshadows Jesus' passion and crucifixion, where He would be rejected and put to death by the religious leaders and Roman authorities. The phrase highlights the continuity of God's redemptive plan and the fulfillment of prophecy, as well as the sacrificial nature of Jesus' mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament known for his powerful ministry and miracles.

Israel&#8217;s failure to recognize the forerunner warns against spiritual dullness, while Jesus&#8217; forecast of His own passion assures us that every detail of God&#8217;s redemptive plan is on schedule. The verse calls believers to trust Scripture&#8217;s accuracy, heed God&#8217;s messengers, and embrace the Savior who knowingly walked the path of suffering for our salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Elias is come already.</span>--These words, the emphatic repetition of what had been said before in <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm" title="And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.">Matthew 11:14</a> (see Note there), ought, it is believed, to be decisive as to the issue raised in the preceding verse. So far as the prophecy of Malachi required the coming of Elijah, that prophecy had been fulfilled in the Baptist, all unconscious of it as he was, as coming in the spirit and power of Elijah (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a>). The disciples need not look for any other personal appearance. The use of the present and future tenses in <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a> point to a deeper truth, which they were to learn afterwards. The Elijah ministry, the work of the preacher of repentance, is not a transient phenomenon belonging to one stage only of the Church's history, but was to be, throughout the ages, on to the end of all things, the indispensable preparation for the coming of the Lord. Only through it could all things be restored, and the path made ready for the heralds of forgiveness and of peace.<p><span class= "bld">They knew him not.</span>--The Greek word implies full and accurate knowledge. Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">they recognised him not.</span> Must we not say that those who, after these words, still look forward to the personal advent of Elijah are unconsciously placing themselves on a level with those whose dimness of perception our Lord thus condemns?<p><span class= "bld">But have done unto him whatsoever they listed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">they did in him</span> (in him, i.e., as the region in which their will wrought) <span class= "ital">whatsoever they would.</span> To "list," now practically archaic, was the same as "lust," without the special evil sense which has attached to the latter word. It is significant that our Lord charges the guilt of the rejection and death of John upon the scribes and the people at large, with no special reference to the Tetrarch Antipas. The passions and intrigues of the palace were but instruments working out the intent of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<p><span class= "bld">Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</span>--Another instance of what may be called the new colour which from the time of the Transfiguration spreads over our Lord's teaching. All is, in one aspect, darker, sadder, more sombre. He is drawing nearer to the cross, and He brings the thought of the cross closer to the minds of the disciples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elias is come already.</span> The mystical, not the real, Elias, even John the Baptist, who came in the spirit and power of Elias (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>). Christ is here speaking of the past, as in the preceding verse he spake of the future. The common Jewish interpretation confused the two events and the two personages, reducing them to one. And this mistake has been committed by many modern expositors. <span class="cmt_word">They knew him not.</span> They did not recognize his true character and the import of his mission. Though they gathered round him and listened to his preaching and denunciations, very few saw in him the precursor of the Messiah, and many, misunderstanding his austere, self-denying life, deemed him to be possessed by a devil (<a href="/matthew/11-18.htm">Matthew 11:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have done unto him.</span> John suffered a long imprisonment, and was eventually murdered; and though Herod was primarily answerable for these doings, the people were virtually guilty, in that they consented to the injurious treatment and made no effort in his favour. <span class="cmt_word">Likewise...also.</span> Taking occasion from the mention of the Baptist's fate, Jesus foretells his own sufferings and death, endeavouring to make the apostles familiar with the idea of a dying as well as a conquering Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
