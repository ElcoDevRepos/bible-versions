This conspiracy highlights the growing tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities. Their plotting fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers take counsel against the Lord and His Anointed. The Greek term used here implies a deliberate and secretive plan, indicating the depth of their hostility.<p><b>to arrest Jesus</b><br>The intent to arrest Jesus was driven by fear of His influence and popularity among the people. The leaders were threatened by His teachings and miracles, which challenged their authority. This arrest was not to be a public spectacle, as they feared the reaction of the crowds who revered Jesus as a prophet. The arrest would eventually lead to His trial and crucifixion, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is led like a lamb to the slaughter.<p><b>covertly</b><br>The leaders sought to capture Jesus in a stealthy manner to avoid public uproar. This secrecy underscores their awareness of Jesus' innocence and their own unjust motives. The covert nature of their plan reflects the darkness of their intentions, contrasting with Jesus' openness and truth. This aligns with <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where those who do evil hate the light and do not come to it.<p><b>and kill Him</b><br>The ultimate goal of the conspiracy was to put Jesus to death. This decision was not just a political maneuver but a fulfillment of divine prophecy. Jesus had foretold His death multiple times (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>), indicating that it was part of God's redemptive plan. The leaders' desire to kill Jesus also echoes the sacrificial system, where the innocent lamb is slain for the sins of the people, pointing to Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish community who were responsible for maintaining the temple and religious law.
