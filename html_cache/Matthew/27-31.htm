Mocking was a common practice to humiliate those condemned to death, especially in the case of someone claiming to be a king. The soldiers' mockery included dressing Jesus in a scarlet robe, placing a crown of thorns on His head, and giving Him a reed as a scepter, parodying the regalia of a king. This act fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected by men.<p><b>they removed the robe</b><br>The removal of the robe signifies the end of the mock coronation. The robe, likely a soldier's cloak, was used to ridicule Jesus' claim to kingship. This act of stripping Him of the robe also symbolizes the stripping away of dignity and humanity, a common practice in Roman executions to shame the condemned.<p><b>and put His own clothes back on Him</b><br>Restoring Jesus' own clothes was a practical step before leading Him to crucifixion, as Roman law required the condemned to be crucified in their own garments. This act also highlights the transition from mockery to the grim reality of execution. It underscores the humanity of Jesus, who, despite being the Son of God, endured the same treatment as any other criminal.<p><b>Then they led Him away to crucify Him</b><br>This phrase marks the beginning of the final journey to Golgotha, the place of crucifixion. The act of leading Jesus away is significant, as it fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, which describes the Messiah being led like a lamb to the slaughter. The crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders, emphasizing the severity of the punishment Jesus endured. This event is central to Christian theology, as it represents the atoning sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of humanity, fulfilling Old Testament types and prophecies, such as the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the passage, who is being mocked and prepared for crucifixion.

He showed the silent Sufferer in the mock insignia of royalty, as if asking them, Is not this enough? The cries of "Crucify Him!" were but redoubled, and once again the cowardly judge took his place in the official chair, and passed the final sentence. The "raiment" which they put on Him again included both the tunic and the cloak, or over-garment. In this case, the former was made without seam or opening (<a href="/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>), and the mere act of drawing it roughly over the lacerated flesh must have inflicted acute agony.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus is led to crucifixion.

"The bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the priest for sin, are burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate" (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11, 12</a>). Lange describes the procession: "Instead of being led forth by litters, the command of whom Pilate, as sub-governor, did not enjoy, Jesus is conducted to the cross by the soldiery. A centurion on horseback, called by Tacitus 'Exactor mortis,' by Seneca 'Centurio supplicio praepositus,' headed the company. A herald, going in front of the condemned, proclaimed his sentence." Behind him walked the prisoner, bearing the instrument of his punishment; a small company of soldiers completed the cavalcade. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they had mocked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#958;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(enepaixan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1702.htm">Strong's 1702: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mock, ridicule.
