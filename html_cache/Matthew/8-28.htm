The Gadarenes were part of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities with a significant Gentile population. This area was known for its Hellenistic influence, which often clashed with Jewish customs and beliefs. The crossing of the sea can be seen as a symbolic act of Jesus bringing His ministry to the Gentiles, foreshadowing the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>He was met by two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs</b><br>The mention of two demon-possessed men highlights the severity of the situation. In Jewish culture, tombs were considered unclean places, and living among them would have been seen as a sign of extreme defilement. The presence of demons in these men underscores the spiritual warfare theme prevalent in the Gospels. This encounter demonstrates Jesus' authority over evil spirits, a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of liberation for the captives.<p><b>They were so violent that no one could pass that way</b><br>The violence of the demon-possessed men emphasizes the destructive power of evil and the fear it instilled in the local population. This detail highlights the hopelessness of the situation before Jesus' intervention. It also serves to magnify the power and authority of Jesus, who is able to bring peace and restoration where there was once chaos and danger.

Jesus has just calmed a fierce storm (<a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-27</a>), demonstrating His command over nature. Now He steps ashore to reveal the same sovereign power over the unseen spiritual realm. The move from the familiar western shore of Galilee to the eastern side signals intentional outreach&#8212;Jesus is not confined to one people or place (cf. <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>). His disciples, still processing the miracle on the water, are about to witness an even more startling display of authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the region of the Gadarenes</b><p>This territory&#8212;part of the largely Gentile Decapolis&#8212;was known for pig farming (<a href="/matthew/8-30.htm">Matthew 8:30-32</a>), an industry avoided by observant Jews. By entering a non-Jewish region, Jesus illustrates that His mission transcends cultural and ethnic boundaries (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). The setting also heightens the story&#8217;s impact: Jewish readers would immediately sense the spiritual uncleanness of both location and circumstance, making the coming deliverance all the more dramatic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was met by two demon-possessed men</b><p><a href="/bsb/mark/5.htm">Mark 5</a> and <a href="/bsb/luke/8.htm">Luke 8</a> focus on one predominant man; Matthew notes that two are involved, emphasizing complete testimony (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>) and underscoring the widespread grip of evil. Demon possession in Scripture is a literal reality&#8212;personal, malevolent spirits taking control of individuals (<a href="/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a>). Yet Jesus never struggles with them; His authority is absolute (<a href="/luke/4-36.htm">Luke 4:36</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). Their immediate confrontation shows how the presence of the Son of God exposes and agitates the powers of darkness.<p>&#8226; The men do not seek Jesus for salvation; the demons within them fear His judgment (<a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s initiative highlights grace: He comes to liberate people who cannot free themselves (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Coming from the tombs</b><p>Living among graves rendered a person ceremonially unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-16</a>).

In all the three Gospels we find various readings, of which the best supported are Gadarenes in St. Matthew, and Gerasenes in St. Mark and St. Luke.

Gadara was a city east of the Sea of Galilee, about sixteen miles from Tiberias. It is identified with the modern U<span class= "ital">m Keis,</span> the ruins of which are more than two miles in circumference, and stand at the north-west extremity of the mountains of Gilead, near the south-east corner of the Lake. The tombs of the city, chambers in the limestone rock often more than twenty feet square, are its most conspicuous feature, and are, indeed, the sole abode of its present inhabitants. Under the Roman occupation it was important enough to have two amphitheatres and a long colonnaded street.<p>(2.) Gerasa was a city in the Gilead district, twenty miles east of the Jordan, described sometimes as belonging to C?le-Syria, sometimes to Arabia. It also has ruins which indicate the former splendour of the city. Of these two, it is clear that Gadara fits in better with all the circumstances of the narrative; and if "Gerasenes" is more than the mistake of a transcriber, it could only be because the name was used vaguely for the whole Gilead district. The reading "Gadarenes" in that case would probably come from some one better acquainted with the position of the two cities.<p>(3.) There was no city named Gergesa, but the name Gergesenes was probably connected with the older Girgashites, one of the Canaanite races that occupied the country before the invasion of Israel (<a href="/genesis/10-16.htm" title="And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,">Genesis 10:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-21.htm" title="And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.">Genesis 15:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-10.htm" title="And Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.">Joshua 3:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Apparently, however, from the last passage referred to, they were on the western side of the Jordan. It is, on the whole, more likely that the reading was a mistake, than that the old tribe still remained with its old name; but it is possible that the name of Gerasa may represent an altered form of <span class= "ital">Girgashim.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-34.</span> <span class="accented">- The Gadarene demoniacs.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a>; <a href="/luke/8-26.htm">Luke 8:26-39</a>, where see full notes. Matthew is much less detailed. Matthew mentions two demoniacs; the parallel passages, one; the reason may be either that one was less fierce than the other, or that only one came from Gerasa (Nosgen). But in our present knowledge of the extent of inspiration, we cannot confidently affirm that the evangelists were kept from errors in numbers, and that the addition of the second demoniac is not due' to some misunderstanding, perhaps of the use of the plural in the demoniac's answer in the parallel passage, <a href="/mark/5-9.htm">Mark 5:9</a> (cf. Weiss, 'Marcus-ev.,' p. 172). (For a similar difficulty, cf. the note on Matthew 9:27-31.) With regard to this mysterious narrative generally, the explanation of its details can be little more than empirical in our present knowledge of psychology and of spiritual influences. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Gergesenes;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">Gadarenes</span>, which is certainly right here, as is "Gerasenes" in the parallel passages (cf. Westcott and Hort, it. 'App.'). Gergesa (Textus Receptus here, and Alexandrian authorities in parallel passages) and Gerasa (unless, with Origen on <a href="/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>, we understand by this the Arabian Gerasa fifty miles away)are probably forms of the same name now represented by <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, a village discovered (? in 1857) by Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 375, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, edit. 1880) on the eastern side of the lake, and lying "within a few rods of the shore," with "an immense mountain" rising directly above it, "in which are ancient tombs, out of some of which the two men possessed of the devils may have issued to meet Jesus. The lake is so near the base of the mountain that the swine, rushing madly down it, could not stop, but would be hurried on into the water and drowned." To this Origen's description (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) corresponds: "Gergesa, to which the Gergesenes belong, is an ancient city by what is now called the Lake of Tiberias, by which is a steep place adjacent to the lake, and down this, as is pointed out, the swine were cast headlong by the demons." Gadara, in some sense the capital of Peraea (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 4:07. 3), and one of the towns of the Decapolis confederacy (ch. 4:25), was some twelve miles distant from <span class="accented">Khersa</span>, and six miles from the nearest part of the lake, to which, in fact (as the stamp of a ship on its coins shows), its territory extended (cf. Schiirer, II. 1. p. 100, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). St. Matthew describes the locality, not by the little-known village, but by the well-known city of the district, to which (as we may gather from the parallel passage, <a href="/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>) the news of the miracle afterwards spread. But since he leaves the expression, "the city," in vers. 33, 34 as he fontal it in his sources, <span class="accented">i.e. Khersa</span>, the result is at first misleading <span class="cmt_word">There met him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">occurrerunt</span>, Vulgate). St. Matthew (contrast vers. 2, 5, 19) omits the nearer approach recorded in the parallel passages, <a href="/mark/5-6.htm">Mark 5:6</a> and <a href="/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Two</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Possessed with devils</span> (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">coming out of the tombs;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">coming forth out.</span> The Greek shows that they did not merely come from among the tombs, but actually out of them (cf. the experience of Warburton, as quoted in Trench on this miracle).

It deepens the contrast to their present behaviour. Perhaps "that way" refers to the Roman road by the side of the lake (cf.
