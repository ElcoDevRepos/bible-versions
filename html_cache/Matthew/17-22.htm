Galilee, a region in northern Israel, was a central location for much of Jesus' teaching and miracles. It was a diverse area with a mix of Jewish and Gentile populations, reflecting the broader mission of Jesus to reach all people. The gathering suggests a moment of intimacy and instruction among Jesus and His disciples, away from the crowds. Galilee is also where Jesus first called His disciples, making it a fitting place for this pivotal revelation.<p><b>Jesus told them</b><br>Jesus often used these moments with His disciples to prepare them for future events. His teachings were direct and personal, aimed at equipping them for the challenges ahead. This statement underscores the importance of His message and the need for the disciples to understand the gravity of what was to come. Jesus' role as a teacher and prophet is evident here, as He reveals future events with authority.<p><b>The Son of Man</b><br>This title, "Son of Man," is one Jesus frequently used for Himself. It has roots in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a messianic figure with authority and dominion. By using this title, Jesus connects His mission to Old Testament prophecy, emphasizing His divine authority and role in God's redemptive plan. It highlights both His humanity and His divine mission, serving as a bridge between His earthly ministry and His heavenly authority.<p><b>is about to be delivered</b><br>The phrase "about to be delivered" indicates the imminence of Jesus' betrayal and suffering. It foreshadows the events leading to His crucifixion, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation. This delivery is not merely a human act of betrayal but part of a divine orchestration for redemption. It reflects the prophetic nature of Jesus' mission, as foretold in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>into the hands of men</b><br>This phrase highlights the human agency involved in Jesus' impending suffering. It underscores the reality of His betrayal by Judas and the subsequent actions of the religious leaders and Roman authorities. The "hands of men" signifies the earthly powers that will temporarily prevail over Jesus, yet it also points to the ultimate victory of God's plan through the resurrection. This phrase serves as a reminder of the tension between human free will and divine sovereignty in the unfolding of salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is foretelling His impending betrayal and crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are with Him in Galilee, receiving His teaching and preparing for the events to come.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in ancient Israel where Jesus conducted much of His ministry and where this particular teaching takes place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_man.htm">The Son of Man</a></b><br>A title Jesus uses for Himself, emphasizing both His humanity and His messianic role, rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_betrayal.htm">The Betrayal</a></b><br>The event Jesus is predicting, where He will be handed over to the authorities, leading to His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' prediction of His betrayal is a reminder of His purpose on earth&#8212;to fulfill God's redemptive plan through His death and resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Despite the betrayal, God's sovereign plan is at work.

Jesus reiterates the prediction continually in order to familiarize his followers with the unwelcome, the incredible, reality.
