Crucifixion was a method used by the Romans to punish criminals and rebels, and it was a public spectacle meant to deter others from similar actions. When Jesus speaks of taking up one's cross, He is referring to a willingness to endure suffering, shame, and even death for His sake. This phrase indicates a call to self-denial and total commitment to Christ, echoing the sacrificial nature of discipleship. The cross symbolizes the burdens and trials that believers may face as they follow Jesus, and it requires a readiness to embrace these challenges.<p><b>and follow Me</b><br>Following Jesus implies a continuous, active pursuit of His teachings and example. It involves a personal relationship with Christ, characterized by obedience and imitation of His life. In the Gospels, Jesus often called His disciples to leave their former lives and follow Him, signifying a radical transformation and reorientation of priorities. This call to follow is not merely about physical proximity but about aligning one's life with the values and mission of Jesus. It is a call to discipleship that demands loyalty and perseverance, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, where Jesus emphasizes the need to take up the cross daily.<p><b>is not worthy of Me</b><br>The concept of worthiness here is tied to the idea of being fit or suitable for the kingdom of God. Jesus sets a high standard for discipleship, indicating that those who are unwilling to bear the cost of following Him are not aligned with His mission. This statement challenges believers to evaluate their commitment and priorities, as true discipleship requires placing Jesus above all else, including personal comfort and security. The notion of worthiness is also reflected in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>, where Jesus speaks of losing one's life for His sake to truly find it. This phrase underscores the seriousness of the call to follow Christ and the transformative nature of genuine faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, providing them with instructions and expectations for discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all who choose to follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>A symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and the cost of discipleship, reflecting the Roman method of execution and the ultimate sacrifice Jesus would make.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_cross.htm">Understanding the Cross</a></b><br>The cross is not just a symbol of suffering but a call to self-denial and total commitment to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/daily_commitment.htm">Daily Commitment</a></b><br>Taking up the cross is a daily decision, requiring ongoing dedication and perseverance in following Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_living.htm">Sacrificial Living</a></b><br>True discipleship involves sacrifice, prioritizing Christ above personal desires and comforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worthy_of_christ.htm">Worthy of Christ</a></b><br>To be worthy of Christ, one must embrace the challenges and sacrifices that come with following Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_suffering.htm">Transformation through Suffering</a></b><br>Embracing the cross leads to spiritual growth and transformation, aligning us more closely with Christ's character.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_10_38_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 10:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_take_up_his_cross_today.htm">What does "take up his cross" mean in Matthew 10:38 for believers today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Prioritize_Jesus_over_desires.htm">How can we prioritize following Jesus over personal desires, as Matthew 10:38 instructs?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_10_38_to_Jesus_crucifixion.htm">How does Matthew 10:38 connect with Jesus' sacrifice on the cross?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_daily_bear_our_cross_today.htm">In what ways can we daily "take up" our cross in modern life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_10_38_s_challenge_to_discipleship.htm">How does Matthew 10:38 challenge our understanding of true discipleship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_take_up_his_cross_in_Matt_10_38.htm">What does "take up his cross" mean in Matthew 10:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_10_38_s_impact_on_discipleship.htm">How does Matthew 10:38 challenge modern Christian discipleship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_self-denial_key_in_Matt_10_38.htm">Why is self-denial important in Matthew 10:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'a_sword'.htm">What did Jesus mean by bringing a sword?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_losing_life.htm">What did Jesus mean by "lose your life for my sake"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_jesus_say_he_brings_a_sword.htm">If Jesus is the Prince of Peace, why does He say, "I have not come to bring peace, but a sword" (Matthew 10:34)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/accept_jesus_as_your_savior.htm">Will you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 10:38 Mean</div><b>Anyone who does not take up his cross</b><p>&#8211; Jesus&#8217; call is unmistakably personal: &#8220;his cross.&#8221; Each disciple has a unique load of sacrifice and surrender.<p>&#8211; A cross in the first-century mind meant one thing&#8212;an instrument of death.

To be His disciple means embracing a personal cross&#8212;daily dying to self, enduring hardship, and yielding desires that conflict with His lordship. It means actively following&#8212;listening, trusting, imitating Him wherever He leads. Refusal to do so shows a heart that prizes self above the Savior, a life &#8220;not worthy&#8221; of the One who first carried the cross for us. True discipleship values Christ above all, proves it by obedient steps, and rests in the assurance that the path of the cross always leads to resurrection joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">He that taketh not his cross.</span>--The words were hardly a specific announcement of the manner of our Lord's death, though they imply, interpreted by events, a distinct prevision of it, such as that which we trace in <a href="/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>. To the disciples they would recall the sad scene which Roman rule had made familiar to them, the procession of robbers or rebels, each carrying the cross on which he was to suffer to the place of execution. They would learn that they were called to a like endurance of ignominy and suffering. When they saw their Master Himself carrying His own cross, the words would come back to their minds with a new significance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - Besides the parallel passage, <a href="/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27</a> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), cf. also (for vers. 38, 39) <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24, 25</a> (parallel passages: <a href="/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34, 35</a>; <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23, 24</a>). .<span class="cmt_word">and he that taketh not</span>; <span class="accented">doth not take</span> (Revised Version), which calls attention to the change to the more definite mode of expression (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)<span class="accented">.
