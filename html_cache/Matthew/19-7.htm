The context is a dialogue between Jesus and the Pharisees, who often sought to test Him. The use of "Why then" suggests they are challenging Jesus' previous statements about marriage and divorce, attempting to find a contradiction or loophole in His teachings.<p><b>&#8220;did Moses order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?&#8221;</b><br>The reference to Moses points to <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, where Moses provided regulations concerning divorce. This was a concession due to the hardness of people's hearts, not an endorsement of divorce. The "certificate of divorce" was a legal document that allowed a woman to remarry, offering her some protection in a patriarchal society. The Pharisees' question reflects a common debate of the time regarding the grounds for divorce, with different rabbinical schools offering varying interpretations. This question also highlights the tension between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law, a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to questions from the Pharisees about the lawfulness of divorce.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

They are referring to <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1, 2</a>. Jesus had escaped the trap which was laid for him, and foiled them by the very words of Scripture and the plain intention of the first institution.
