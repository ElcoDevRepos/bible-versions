In biblical times, a talent was a significant sum of money, often equivalent to about 20 years of a laborer's wages. The servant's receipt of one talent indicates a substantial responsibility, despite being less than the others received. This reflects the principle that God entrusts individuals with resources according to their abilities (<a href="/matthew/25-15.htm">Matthew 25:15</a>). The servant's actions are a focal point for understanding stewardship and accountability in the Kingdom of Heaven.<p><b>went off</b><br>The phrase "went off" suggests a deliberate action taken by the servant. It implies a choice to separate himself from the immediate presence of his master and the other servants. This decision can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual distancing or neglect of one's divine calling. The servant's departure from the master's presence symbolizes a lack of engagement with the responsibilities given by God.<p><b>dug a hole in the ground</b><br>Digging a hole in the ground was a common method in ancient times for safeguarding valuables. This action reflects a mindset of fear and self-preservation rather than faith and initiative. The servant's choice to bury the talent contrasts with the proactive investments made by the other servants. Biblically, this act can be seen as a failure to utilize God-given gifts for His glory, reminiscent of the warning in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> about faith without works being dead.<p><b>and hid his master&#8217;s money</b><br>Hiding the master's money signifies a lack of trust and understanding of the master's intentions. The servant's actions demonstrate a failure to recognize the opportunity to grow and multiply what was entrusted to him. This reflects a broader spiritual truth about the misuse of divine gifts and opportunities. Theologically, it underscores the importance of being faithful stewards of God's resources, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>, where believers are called to use their gifts to serve others. The servant's behavior serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of inaction and neglect in the spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents individuals who have been entrusted with resources or responsibilities by God.

He receives a valuable trust, distances himself from the giver, spends effort on non-productive self-preservation, and hides what was meant to serve the master&#8217;s interests. Jesus warns that neglect&#8212;not only open rebellion&#8212;provokes the Master&#8217;s displeasure. Each believer must remain close to the Lord, act in faith, and put His gifts to work for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">He that had received one</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--There is something strikingly suggestive in the fact that those who had received the higher sums were "good and faithful," and that it was left to the man who had received the smallest to fail in his duty. Failure in the use of wider opportunities brings with it a greater condemnation; but it is true, as a fact of human nature which our Lord thus recognised, that in such cases there is commonly less risk of failure. The very presence of the opportunities brings with it a sense of responsibility. So faithfulness in a very little receives its full reward, but the consciousness of having but a little, when men do not believe in their Master's wisdom and love in giving them but a little, tempts to discontent and so to sloth on the one hand, and on the other, as with Judas, to hasty and unscrupulous greed of immediate gain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that had received one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the one</span> talent).

So, like all Easterns, he buried the little treasure in the ground, to keep it safe till his lord should ask tot it. recognizing that it was not his own to treat as he liked, but that it still belonged to him who had entrusted it to his care. The man had some special grace, but he never exercised it, never let it shine before men, or bring forth the fruit of good works. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the [servant]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
