His reply indicates His authority and knowledge of Scripture, setting the stage for a teaching moment. Jesus often used questions to engage His audience and challenge their understanding, a common rabbinic method.<p><b>Have you not read</b><br>This phrase suggests familiarity with the Scriptures, as Jesus addresses the Pharisees, who were well-versed in the Law and the Prophets. It implies that the answer to their question is found in the Scriptures they claim to know. This rhetorical question challenges their interpretation and understanding of the law.<p><b>what David did</b><br>Jesus refers to an event from the life of King David, a revered figure in Jewish history. This reference to David is significant because it draws a parallel between David, a man after God's own heart, and Jesus Himself. It also highlights the importance of understanding the spirit of the law rather than a rigid adherence to its letter.<p><b>when he and his companions were hungry</b><br>This context is crucial as it emphasizes human need and compassion over strict legalism. The story Jesus refers to is found in <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-6</a>, where David and his men ate the consecrated bread from the tabernacle because they were in need.

<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39-40</a>).<p>&#8226; By replying rather than debating, Jesus models confident reliance on the written Word, showing that Scripture is the final court of appeal (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>;
