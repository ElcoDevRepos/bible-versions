His grief indicates a conflict between his conscience and his circumstances. Herod respected John the Baptist, recognizing him as a righteous and holy man (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>). This internal struggle highlights the moral weakness of Herod, who, despite his authority, is swayed by external pressures. The grief also reflects the broader biblical theme of the struggle between sin and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15-25</a>.<p><b>but because of his oaths</b><br>Herod had made a rash promise to Herodias's daughter, Salome, after her dance pleased him and his guests. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, oaths were considered binding and sacred, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>. Breaking an oath could lead to a loss of honor and credibility. Herod's adherence to his oath, despite his personal grief, underscores the cultural and social importance of keeping one's word, even when it leads to unjust actions.<p><b>and his guests</b><br>The presence of guests at Herod's birthday banquet added social pressure to fulfill his promise. In the context of a public setting, maintaining honor and reputation was paramount. The guests likely included influential figures, making Herod's decision a matter of public image. This scenario reflects the biblical theme of peer pressure and the fear of man, as cautioned against in <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>.<p><b>he ordered that her wish be granted</b><br>Herod's decision to grant Salome's request for John the Baptist's head demonstrates the tragic consequences of prioritizing human approval over divine righteousness. This act of yielding to sinful demands contrasts with the steadfastness of Jesus, who resisted temptation and remained obedient to God's will (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). Herod's compliance with the request also fulfills the prophecy of John the Baptist's martyrdom, as he was the forerunner of Christ, preparing the way for the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_herod_antipas.htm">King Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The ruler of Galilee and Perea, known for his moral weaknesses and political maneuvering.

Yet sin never sits still: Herod&#8217;s prior lustful gaze at Herodias&#8217; daughter (<a href="/matthew/14-6.htm">Matthew 14:6</a>) now collided with his guilty realization that an innocent prophet&#8217;s life hung in the balance. Like Pilate later (<a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>), Herod felt sorrow without repentance. The moment exposes the inner tug-of-war between conviction and corrupted desire (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but because of his oaths</b><p>Publicly, Herod had promised the girl &#8220;whatever you ask&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-23.htm">Mark 6:23</a>).

Jephthah&#8217;s tragic vow (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-40</a>) illustrates that keeping a sinful oath multiplies sin; the right course is humble confession and reversal. Herod chose image over integrity, confusing stubborn consistency with faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his guests</b><p>Royal dinner companions magnified the pressure.

The downward spiral moved from sensuality to pride to murder. John&#8217;s beheading appeared to silence truth, yet God later turned even this injustice into a louder proclamation; Jesus&#8217; ministry accelerated (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>) and John&#8217;s bold witness still speaks (<a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a> reveals a sobering chain: a conflicted conscience, a reckless vow, peer pressure, and a deadly command.

In that moment there must have come before his mind his past reverence for the prophet, the joy which had for a time accompanied the strivings of a better life, possibly the counsels of his foster-brother Manaen. Had there been only the personal influence of Herodias these might have prevailed against it, but, like most weak men, Herod feared to be thought weak. It was not so much his regard for the oath which he had taken (that, had it been taken in secret, he might have got over), but his shrinking from the taunt, or whispered jest, or contemptuous gesture of the assembled guests, if they should see him draw back from his plighted word. A false regard for public opinion, for what people will say or think of us in our own narrow circle, was in this, as in so many other instances, an incentive to guilt instead of a restraint.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake;</span> better, <span class="accented">and though the king was grieved, yet for the sake of his oaths</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7a;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.). That he was grieved at John's death is a verbal contradiction to ver. 5, but after some weeks' or months' delay psychologically quite possible (cf. note there).
