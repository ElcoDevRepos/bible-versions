Previously, Jesus had been in the region of Tyre and Sidon, where He healed the daughter of a Canaanite woman. This movement signifies His return to predominantly Jewish areas, emphasizing His mission to the "lost sheep of Israel" (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>). It also highlights the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry, as He traveled extensively to preach and perform miracles.<p><b>Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee</b><br>The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Gennesaret or the Sea of Tiberias, is a freshwater lake in the northeastern part of Israel. It was a central location for much of Jesus' ministry, providing a backdrop for many of His teachings and miracles. The sea's proximity to various towns and villages made it an ideal location for reaching large crowds. This area was familiar to Jesus and His disciples, many of whom were fishermen from the region (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>).<p><b>Then He went up on a mountain</b><br>Mountains in biblical narratives often serve as places of revelation and divine encounter. In the Old Testament, Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai, and Elijah encountered God on Mount Horeb. Similarly, Jesus frequently used mountains as settings for significant teachings and events, such as the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) and the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>). This ascent suggests a setting apart from the crowds, preparing for a moment of teaching or miraculous activity.<p><b>and sat down</b><br>In Jewish culture, sitting was the traditional posture for a teacher or rabbi when instructing others. This act indicates that Jesus was preparing to teach or engage with those who would come to Him. It also reflects His authority as a teacher, as He assumes a position that invites others to gather around Him for instruction or healing. This posture is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus sits to teach, such as in the synagogue or when addressing His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A significant body of water in the region of Galilee, known for its role in Jesus' ministry, including miracles and teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountain.htm">Mountain</a></b><br>A place often associated with significant events in Jesus' ministry, symbolizing a place of teaching, revelation, and prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_intentional_movement.htm">Jesus' Intentional Movement</a></b><br>Jesus' journey along the Sea of Galilee and up the mountain was purposeful.

Jesus physically leaves that Gentile region and heads back toward predominantly Jewish territory, yet He carries the same compassion and authority.<p>&#8211; This simple phrase shows Jesus&#8217; intentional movement; His ministry is not random but directed by the Father (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<p>&#8211; It also reminds us that each scene in the Gospels builds on the last, revealing more of who Jesus is and what He came to do.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee</b><p>&#8211; The shoreline was dotted with villages like Bethsaida and Capernaum where Jesus had already healed and taught (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>; <a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16-34</a>). Walking that familiar coast signals a continued offer of grace to people who had both received and resisted Him.<p>&#8211; Cross-reference: In Mark&#8217;s parallel (<a href="/mark/7-31.htm">Mark 7:31</a>) Jesus loops through the Decapolis, hinting that He ministers to Jews and Gentiles alike&#8212;fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, &#8220;The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.&#8221;<p>&#8211; By returning to the lake, He positions Himself where crowds can gather easily, setting the stage for the healings that follow (<a href="/matthew/15-30.htm">Matthew 15:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then He went up on a mountain</b><p>&#8211; Mountains in Matthew are places of revelation: the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>), prayer (<a href="/matthew/14-23.htm">Matthew 14:23</a>), and later the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-2</a>). Climbing higher signals something significant is about to unfold.<p>&#8211; Practically, the elevation gives space for multitudes to assemble, much like Moses on Sinai addressing Israel (<a href="/bsb/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>). Jesus stands as the greater Moses, leading a new exodus of healing and deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sat down</b><p>&#8211; Rabbis sat to teach with authority (<a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1-2</a>; <a href="/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>). Jesus&#8217; posture tells the crowd He is ready to instruct and to judge righteously (<a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Sitting also invites those who are weary to come near (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). Immediately, the lame, blind, mute, and crippled approach Him, finding rest and restoration (<a href="/matthew/15-30.htm">Matthew 15:30</a>).<p>&#8211; The scene anticipates the messianic banquet on the mountain where the Lord &#8220;will swallow up death forever&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/15-29.htm">Matthew 15:29</a> places Jesus on a purposeful journey: leaving one ministry setting, walking the familiar Galilean shore, ascending a mountain, and assuming the teacher&#8217;s seat. Each movement highlights His sovereignty, compassion, and readiness to heal and instruct all who come. The verse prepares us for the cascade of miracles that follow, confirming that the promised Messiah has arrived and that His kingdom is breaking in with power and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Jesus departed from</span> <span class= "bld">thence.</span>--As St. Mark (in the better MSS.) gives the narrative, His journey led Him actually through Sidon. It was the one instance in which He visited a distinctly heathen city, and walked by the shore of the Great Sea, and looked out towards the isles of Chittim, the isles of the Gentiles, to which His name was to come in after years as the message of joy and peace and life. It is significant, as Sidon lay to the north of Tyre, that He thus extended His journey, as though seeking for Himself and His disciples a longer period of rest for prayer and meditation. His return to Galilee must have been through some of the mountain passes of the Hermon range, bringing Him down upon the eastern shore of the lake.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-39.</span> - <span class="accented">Healing of the sick, and feeding of the four thousand.</span> (<a href="/mark/7-31.htm">Mark 7:31</a>; <a href="/mark/8-1.htm">Mark 8:1-10</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From thence</span>.
