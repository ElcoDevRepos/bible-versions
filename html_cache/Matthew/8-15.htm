The act of touching is significant, as it shows Jesus' personal involvement and care. In Jewish culture, touching someone with a fever could render a person ceremonially unclean, yet Jesus transcends these cultural norms to bring healing. This touch signifies the power and authority of Jesus over sickness, reflecting His divine nature. It also prefigures the way Jesus would later touch the lives of many through His ministry, showing that He is not distant but intimately involved with humanity.<p><b>and the fever left her</b><br>The immediate healing of Peter's mother-in-law illustrates Jesus' authority over physical ailments. Fever, often seen as a symptom of a more serious illness, was a common and sometimes deadly condition in the ancient world. The instantaneous nature of the healing underscores the miraculous power of Jesus, affirming His identity as the Messiah. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our sicknesses. It also serves as a testament to the Kingdom of God breaking into the world through Jesus' ministry, where sickness and suffering are overcome.<p><b>and she got up and began to serve Him</b><br>The response of Peter's mother-in-law is immediate and practical. Her service is a natural reaction to the healing she received, demonstrating gratitude and recognition of Jesus' authority. In the cultural context, hospitality was a significant virtue, and her actions reflect the proper response to divine intervention. This service can be seen as a model for discipleship, where those who have experienced Jesus' transformative power respond by serving Him and others. It also highlights the restoration not just to health but to community and purpose, as she resumes her role in the household. This mirrors the call for believers to serve Christ in response to His work in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus demonstrates His divine authority and compassion by healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter's_mother-in-law.htm">Peter's Mother-in-law</a></b><br>The woman who is healed by Jesus.
