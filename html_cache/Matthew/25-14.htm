The "man" represents Jesus Himself, who would soon depart from the earth after His resurrection. The journey signifies Jesus' ascension to heaven and the period before His second coming. Parables often use everyday situations to convey spiritual truths, and journeys were common in the ancient world due to trade and travel.<p><b>who called his servants</b><br>The servants symbolize believers or followers of Christ. In the cultural context of the time, servants were often entrusted with significant responsibilities, reflecting the trust and authority given to them by their master. This calling indicates a personal relationship and responsibility, as believers are called to serve God and His purposes.<p><b>and entrusted them with his possessions</b><br>The possessions represent the gifts, talents, and resources God gives to each believer. This entrustment implies stewardship, a key biblical principle where believers are accountable for how they use what God has given them. The concept of stewardship is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>, which speaks of using gifts to serve others.

The Greek runs simply, "For as a man . . . called his own servants," with no formal close to the comparison. The parable thus introduced has obviously many points in common with that of the Pounds recorded by St. Luke (<a href="/context/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12-27</a>), but the distinctive features of each are also so characteristic that it will be well to deal with each separately, and to reserve a comparison of the two till both have been interpreted.<p>The outward framework of the parable lies in the Eastern way of dealing with property in the absence of the owner. Two courses were open as an approximation to what we call investment. The more primitive and patriarchal way was for the absentee to make his slaves his agents. They were to till his land and sell the produce, or to use the money which he left with them as capital in trading. In such cases there was, of course, often an understanding that they should receive part of the profits, but being their master's slaves, there was no formal contract. The other course was to take advantage of the banking, money-changing, money-lending system, of which the Ph?nicians were the inventors, and which at the time was in full operation throughout the Roman empire The bankers received money on deposit and paid interest on it, and then lent it at a higher percentage, or employed it in trade, or (as did the <span class= "ital">publicani</span> at Rome) in farming the revenues of a province. This was therefore the natural resource, as investment in stocks or companies is with us, for those who had not energy to engage in business.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-30.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the talents.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) Following on the lesson of watchfulness and inward personal preparation just given, this parable enforces the necessity of external work and man's accountability to God for the due use of the special endowments which he has received. The former was concerned chiefly with the contemplative life, the waiting virgins; this chiefly with the active, the working servant; though, in fact, both states combine more or less in the good Christian, and the perfect disciple will unite in himself the characteristics of John and Peter, Mary and Martha. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11-27</a>) has recorded a somewhat analogous parable spoken by Christ on leaving the house of Zacchaeus, known as the parable of the pounds; and some critics have deemed that the two accounts relate to the same saying altered in some details, which are to be accounted for on the hypothesis that St. Luke has combined with our parable another on the rebellious citizens. That there are great resemblances between the two cannot be disputed, but the discrepancies are too marked to allow us to assume the unity of the two utterances. Christ often repeats himself, using the same figure, or illustration, or expression to enforce different truths or different phases of the same truth, as here he may have desired more emphatically to impress on the disciples their special responsibilities. The variations in the two parables are briefly these: The scene and occasion are different; this was spoken to the disciples, that to the multitude; in one the lord is a noble who was to receive a kingdom, in the other he is simply a landowner; here his absence is a matter of local space, there it is a matter of time; the servants are ten in the one case, and three in the other; ill one we have pounds spoken of, in the other talents; in St. Luke each servant has the same sum delivered to him, in St. Matthew the amount is divided into talents, five, two, and one; in the "pounds" the servants show differing faithfulness with the same gifts, in the "talents" two of them display the same faithfulness with differing gifts; here the idle servant hides his money in a napkin, there he buries it in the earth; the conclusions also of the parables vary. Their object is not identical: the parable in our text illustrates the truth that we shall be judged according to that which we have received; the parable in St. Luke shows, to use Trench's words, that "as men differ in fidelity, in zeal, in labour, so will they differ in the amount of their spiritual gain." The latter treats of the use of gifts common to all, whether bodily, mental, or spiritual, such as one faith, one baptism, reason, conscience, sacraments, the Word of God; the former is concerned with the exercise of endowments which have been bestowed according to the recipient's capacity and his ability to make use of them, - the question being, how he has employed his powers, opportunities, and circumstances, the particular advantages, examples, and means of grace given to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> the kingdom of heaven is <span class="cmt_word">as a man</span> The opening sentence in the original is anacoluthic, and our translators have supplied what they supposed to be wanting. The Greek has only, <span class="accented">For just as a man</span>, etc.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">sicut enim homo.</span> The other member of the comparison is not expressed. The Revised Version gives," It is as when a man." They who receive the possible interpolation at the end of ver. 13 would simply render, "For he (the Son of man) is as a man." The Authorized Version plainly affords the intended meaning in the words of the usual preface to such parables (ver. 1; <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24, 31</a>, etc.). The conjunction "for" carries us back to the Lord's solemn injunction, introducing a new illustration of the necessity of watchfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Travelling into a far country</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">leaving home</span>). Here our Lord, being about to withdraw his bodily presence from the earth and to ascend into heaven, represents himself as a man going into another country, and first putting his affairs in order and issuing instructions to his servants (comp. <a href="/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3; 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who called his own</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">servants</span>. The sentence literally is, <span class="accented">As a man</span>... <span class="accented">called his own bond servants.</span> Those who specially belonged to him - a figure of all Christians, members of Christ, doing him service as their Master. <span class="cmt_word">Delivered unto them his goods</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">his possessions</span>). This was not an absolute gift, as we see from subsequent proceedings, and from the well known relation of master and slave. The latter, generally speaking, could possess no property, but he was often employed to administer his master's property for his lord's advantage, or was set up in business on capital advanced by his owner, paying him all or a certain share of the profits. The money still was not the slave's, and legally all that a slave acquired by whatsoever means belonged to his master, though custom had sanctioned a more equitable distribution. The "goods" delivered unto the lord's servants represent the special privileges accorded to them - differences of character, opportunities, education, etc., which they do not share in common with all men. This is one point, as above remarked, in which this parable varies from that of the "pounds."
