In the cultural context of first-century Judea, physical disabilities were often seen as a sign of sin or divine displeasure, though this was not a universal belief. The presence of this man in the synagogue suggests he was seeking healing or spiritual guidance. The withered hand can also be seen as a symbol of spiritual barrenness, which Jesus came to restore. This incident occurs in a synagogue, a place of worship and teaching, highlighting the religious setting where Jesus often performed miracles and taught.<p><b>In order to accuse Jesus, they asked Him,</b><br>The "they" refers to the Pharisees, a religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and additional oral traditions. Their question was not out of genuine curiosity but was a trap to find grounds to accuse Jesus of breaking the Sabbath law. The Pharisees were often in conflict with Jesus because He challenged their interpretations and authority. This reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who were threatened by His teachings and popularity. The Pharisees' focus on legalism contrasts with Jesus' emphasis on mercy and compassion.<p><b>&#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the Pharisees centers on the interpretation of the Sabbath law, which prohibited work on the seventh day. Healing was considered work by some religious leaders, and thus, they deemed it unlawful on the Sabbath. However, the Law of Moses did not explicitly forbid acts of mercy or healing on the Sabbath. Jesus often used such questions to teach deeper spiritual truths, emphasizing the spirit of the law over the letter. This question also highlights the broader theme of Jesus' ministry: the fulfillment and reinterpretation of the Law. Jesus' response to such challenges often pointed to the greater principle of love and mercy, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and performing miracles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man_with_a_withered_hand.htm">Man with a Withered Hand</a></b><br>An individual suffering from a physical ailment, present in the synagogue.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses, often in conflict with Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>A Jewish place of worship and teaching, where this event takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>The seventh day of the week, a day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, central to the conflict in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sabbath.htm">Understanding the Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath is meant for rest and worship, but also for doing good and showing mercy.

In Scripture physical brokenness often becomes the stage on which God&#8217;s compassion is displayed (<a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12-13</a>; <a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a>).<p>- The man does not speak, ask, or beg. His silent presence is enough. Jesus frequently responds to unspoken pain (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p>- This setup immediately highlights two themes that run through the Gospels:<p>&#8226; Human helplessness in the face of real suffering.<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s readiness to act, validating His messianic identity (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In order to accuse Jesus, they asked Him</b><p>- The Pharisees are watching, not with hope, but with hostility (<a href="/matthew/9-11.htm">Matthew 9:11</a>; 22:15). Their motive is explicit: &#8220;in order to accuse.&#8221;<p>- Their hearts reveal the danger of legalism&#8212;using God&#8217;s good law as a weapon rather than a blessing (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12-13</a>).<p>- Earlier confrontations show the pattern: critics question Jesus&#8217; table fellowship (<a href="/luke/5-30.htm">Luke 5:30</a>), fasting practices (<a href="/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>), even His authority (<a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>). Each time, accusation, not curiosity, drives them.<p>- Notice the irony: while plotting evil on the Sabbath, they fault Jesus for doing good (<a href="/john/7-19.htm">John 7:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221;</b><p>- The question sounds pious but is a trap. Sabbath law called for rest (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), yet rabbinic tradition permitted life-saving aid. Would compassion for a non-life-threatening condition &#8220;break&#8221; the Sabbath?<p>- Jesus has just declared, &#8220;For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>). The Pharisees ignore that claim and press Him anyway.<p>- His later reply appeals to common sense mercy: rescuing a sheep from a pit is permissible; &#8220;How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-11.htm">Matthew 12:11-12</a>; cf. <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p>- Underlying truth: the Sabbath was made for mankind&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>), and healing reflects God&#8217;s restorative intent (<a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13-14</a>).<p>- Bullet takeaways<p>&#8226; Lawful? Yes&#8212;because God&#8217;s law prioritizes love (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus exposes the critics&#8217; hardness of heart (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The miracle that follows vindicates both His authority and His compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/12-10.htm">Matthew 12:10</a> shows a collision between rigid religiosity and the life-giving heart of God. The withered hand spotlights human need; the Pharisees&#8217; plot exposes sinful motives; the Sabbath question brings everything into sharp focus. Jesus will soon heal the man, proving that doing good never violates God&#8217;s day of rest. The passage calls readers to embrace mercy over mere rule-keeping, trusting the Lord of the Sabbath who delights in restoring what is broken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">There was a man which had his hand withered.</span>--Two facts are implied: (1.)

In the narrative of healing the man with the dropsy, found in <a href="/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1-6</a> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), a similar question is asked by our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?</span> The Tahnudic answer is that it is unlawful except in cases of actual danger to life (cf. Schurer, IL 2:104). but whether this distinction was really drawn as early as the time of our Lord {s not known in the present backward state of all critical investigations of Jewish literature. <span class="cmt_word">That they might accuse him;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>before the local court, <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a> (Meyer). Observe that, recognizing his readiness to help others, they desire (according to Matthew) to get a clear statement from him whether he would follow the traditional law (as we may assume it was) or net, intending to base their accusation on his reply. Verbally, however, Christ avoids the dilemma, as in the more famous case of the tribute to Caesar (<a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anthr&#333;pos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_444.htm">Strong's 444: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man, one of the human race.
