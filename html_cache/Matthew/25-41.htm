In the context of <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>, Jesus is describing the final judgment, where the sheep (righteous) are placed on His right and the goats (unrighteous) on His left. This separation reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of distinguishing between those who are accepted and those who are rejected. The imagery of sheep and goats would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, as shepherds often separated these animals for different purposes.<p><b>&#8216;Depart from Me,</b><br>This phrase indicates a final and irreversible separation from the presence of God. In biblical terms, to be in God's presence is to experience His blessing and favor, while to be cast away signifies judgment and exclusion from His kingdom. This echoes the language of <a href="/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a>, where the psalmist calls for evildoers to depart, and it aligns with the theme of separation found throughout Scripture, such as in the parable of the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p><b>you who are cursed,</b><br>The concept of being cursed is deeply rooted in the biblical narrative, beginning with the curse pronounced upon the serpent, the ground, and Cain in Genesis. In this context, those who are cursed are those who have rejected God's ways and are thus subject to His judgment. This contrasts with the blessings promised to the righteous, as seen in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>). The curse here is not arbitrary but a result of one's actions and choices, reflecting the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>.<p><b>into the eternal fire</b><br>The imagery of fire is frequently used in Scripture to symbolize judgment and purification. In this passage, the fire is described as eternal, indicating the permanence and severity of the judgment. This aligns with other biblical references to eternal punishment, such as in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where the devil, the beast, and the false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire. The concept of eternal fire serves as a stark warning of the consequences of rejecting God's salvation.<p><b>prepared for the devil and his angels.</b><br>This phrase highlights that the eternal fire was originally intended for the devil and his angels, not for humanity. It underscores the biblical teaching that God desires all people to be saved (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) and that hell was not created for humans. However, those who align themselves with the devil through unbelief and disobedience share in his fate. This reflects the cosmic battle between good and evil, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>, where Michael and his angels fight against the dragon and his angels. The ultimate defeat of the devil and his forces is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, affirming God's ultimate victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is delivering a parable about the final judgment, emphasizing the separation of the righteous from the unrighteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_on_his_left.htm">Those on His Left</a></b><br>Represents the unrighteous or those who have not lived according to God's will.

In the parable-scene, sheep on the right receive blessing, goats on the left receive condemnation (<a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; This right-left imagery underscores separation between genuine believers and mere professors, paralleling Jesus&#8217; earlier picture of wheat versus weeds (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30, 40</a>-43).<p>&#8226; No one is neutral; every person ultimately stands on one side or the other (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>;

Throughout Scripture, fellowship with God equals life (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>); separation equals death (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus once graciously invited, &#8220;Come to Me&#8221;

Yet its warning also highlights the urgency of turning to the Savior now, while &#8220;whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Ye cursed.</span>--The omission of the words "of My Father," which might have seemed necessary to complete the parallelism with <a href="/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a>, is every way significant.

It is conveyed in terms parallel to that on the righteous; but how infinite the difference! <span class="cmt_word">Depart from me!</span> Not "Come!" (ver. 34). What a world of misery is contained in this word, "Depart"! As the light of God's countenance is happiness, so banishment from his presence is utter woe. What it implies we know not; we will not attempt to imagine. God preserve us from ever knowing! <span class="cmt_word">Ye cursed.</span> He had called the righteous, "blessed of my Father;" he does not term these, "cursed of my Father," because God willeth not the death of a sinner. "Not he laid the curse upon them, but their own works" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). It was no part of God's design that any of his creatures should suffer this misery. "God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living. For he created all things, that they might have their being...but ungodly men with their words and works called death unto them" (Wisd. 1:13, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Into everlasting fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the fire which is even lasting</span>). To the poignant regret for the loss of happiness and of the presence of God there is added physical anguish, expressed metaphorically by the term "fire." This is called everlasting, and however in these days of compromise we may seek to minimize or modify the attribute, it was so understood by our Lord's hearers (see below on ver. 46). <span class="cmt_word">Prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> This region or sphere of torment was not, as the kingdom of the righteous, prepared for man originally; it was particularly designed (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) for Satan and his myrmidons (see <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4, 9</a>), and will not be perfected till the last judgment (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). There is no hint of its being remedial or corrective; and what it is to the devil it must be to those who share it with him. It is man's own doing that he is unfit for the company of saints and angels, and, having made himself like unto the evil spirits by rebellion and hatred of good, he must consort with them and share their doom. It seems as though there were no proper place for man's punishment; there is no book of death corresponding to the book of life (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, etc.); the wicked are in an anomalous state, and, shut out by their own action from their proper inheritance, fall into the society of demons. How to reconcile this destiny, which seems inconceivably terrible, with God's mercy, love, and justice, has always proved a stumbling block to free thinkers. It is, indeed, a mystery which we cannot understand, and which Christ has purposely left unexplained. We can only bow the head and say, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
