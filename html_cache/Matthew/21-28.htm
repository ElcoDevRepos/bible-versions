By framing the story with a probing question, presenting a father with two sons, highlighting the father&#8217;s personal approach, and issuing an urgent call to work, Jesus shows that God seeks immediate, tangible response from His children. True faith is measured not by words alone but by timely, willing labor in the Father&#8217;s vineyard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">But what think ye?</span>--The question serves to connect the parable with the foregoing incident, and so gives point to its special primary application.

They say to him, The first.

Both of those who are called to work are "sons," and not hired labourers--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, there is a recognition of both Pharisees and publicans, the outwardly religious and the conspicuously irreligious, as being alike, in a sense, children of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the two sons</span>.

By this and the succeeding parables, Jesus shows his interlocutors their true guilty position and the punishment that awaited them. He himself explains the present parable in reference to his hearers, though, of course, it has, and is meant to have, a much wider application. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">a man</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>had two sons.</span> The man represents God; the two sons symbolize two classes of Jews - the Pharisees, with their followers and imitators; and the lawless and sinful, who made no pretence of religion. The former are those who profess to keep the Law strictly, to the very letter, though they care nothing for its spirit, and virtually divorce religion from morality The latter are careless and profane persons, whom the Lord calls "publicans and harlots" (ver. 31). <span class="cmt_word">The first.</span> Westcott and Hort, relying on no very weighty authority, reverse the order of the sons' answers, altering ver. 31 in agreement with this arrangement. Christ's reply countenances the received text, setting the repentant before the professing son. It is a matter of small importance (see Tischendorf, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). "The first son "here typifies the evil and immoral among the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>, <span class="accented">work</span> <span class="cmt_word">today.</span> Two emphatic imperatives. Immediate obedience is required. "Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts" (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7, 8</a>). God called his sons to serve in his <span class="cmt_word">vineyard</span> - the Church. He called them by the prophets, and more especially by John the Baptist, to turn from evil ways, and to do works meet for repentance (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>).
