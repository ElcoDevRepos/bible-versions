This recognition suggests that Jesus' ministry and miracles had become widely known, even in regions He had not frequently visited. The men of the place likely heard of His teachings and miraculous healings, which were spreading throughout the land. This recognition also reflects the fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah being known and sought after by the people of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>they sent word to all the surrounding region</b><br>This action demonstrates the urgency and importance the people placed on Jesus' presence. The spreading of the word throughout the region shows the communal nature of society at the time, where news was shared orally and quickly among villages. It also highlights the people's faith and hope in Jesus' ability to heal and perform miracles, prompting them to gather as many as possible to benefit from His presence. This mirrors the early church's mission to spread the gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>People brought all the sick to Him</b><br>This phrase underscores the compassion and desperation of the people seeking healing. It reflects the cultural and historical context where medical knowledge was limited, and people often relied on spiritual or miraculous intervention for healing. The act of bringing the sick to Jesus signifies faith in His power and authority over illness, aligning with the biblical theme of Jesus as the Great Physician (<a href="/mark/2-17.htm">Mark 2:17</a>).

Like the disciples on the Emmaus road later &#8220;whose eyes were opened&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>), these townspeople connected the prophetic dots: the One Isaiah foretold (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5&#8211;6</a>) was standing in their streets.<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s reliability shines&#8212;people respond in real time to the living, incarnate Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they sent word to all the surrounding region</b><p>&#8226; Their faith moved them to action. Word spread rapidly, much as the healed leper publicized Jesus despite being told to keep silent (<a href="/mark/1-45.htm">Mark 1:45</a>).<p>&#8226; This impulse to broadcast good news anticipates the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19&#8211;20</a>). Ordinary believers became heralds, modeling how personal testimony ripples outward (<a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28&#8211;30</a>; <a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the collective effort: men, families, neighbors all join in. Scripture shows similar &#8220;network evangelism&#8221; when Andrew brings Peter (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41&#8211;42</a>) and when Cornelius gathers relatives (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Their announcement demonstrates confidence that Jesus&#8217; power is unlimited by geography; He can reach &#8220;all the surrounding region,&#8221; fulfilling the promise that salvation would extend &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>people brought all the sick to Him</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all the sick&#8221; underscores Christ&#8217;s comprehensive compassion&#8212;no ailment excluded. Earlier crowds came with &#8220;every kind of disease&#8221; and He healed them (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This is faith in motion: they did not merely pray for the sick; they physically carried them to Jesus, mirroring the four friends who lowered a paralytic through a roof (<a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; readiness to receive each sufferer fulfills Messianic prophecy: &#8220;He Himself took our infirmities and carried our diseases&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene previews the Church&#8217;s later ministry of intercession and care (<a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14&#8211;16</a>), reminding believers today that Christ still invites the burdened to come (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-35.htm">Matthew 14:35</a> reveals a chain of faith-filled responses: recognition of Jesus&#8217; identity, proclamation to others, and tangible bringing of every need to Him.
