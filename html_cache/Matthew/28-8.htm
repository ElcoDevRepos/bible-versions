Their immediate reaction was to leave quickly, indicating the urgency and importance of the event. The tomb, located outside Jerusalem, was a new tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea. The act of hurrying away signifies the profound impact of the resurrection, a pivotal moment in Christian faith, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy of rising on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>).<p><b>in fear and great joy</b><br>The emotions of fear and joy reflect a complex response to the divine encounter. Fear, in this context, is a reverential awe rather than terror, acknowledging the supernatural event they witnessed. Great joy signifies the fulfillment of Jesus' promises and the hope of eternal life. This duality of emotions is common in biblical theophanies, where human beings encounter the divine (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, <a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-10</a>).<p><b>and ran to tell His disciples</b><br>The women were entrusted with the message of the resurrection, highlighting their role as the first evangelists. This act of running to tell the disciples underscores the urgency and importance of the resurrection news. The disciples, who were in hiding due to fear of persecution, needed this confirmation to strengthen their faith and prepare for their mission. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier instructions to spread the Gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and sets the stage for the Great Commission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>The verse refers to the women who visited Jesus' tomb.
