The term "sins against you" indicates a personal offense or wrongdoing. In the cultural context of the time, maintaining community harmony was crucial, and addressing sin was a way to preserve unity. The concept of sinning against another is rooted in the Old Testament, where interpersonal wrongs were addressed within the community (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>).<p><b>go and confront him privately</b><br>The directive to "go" suggests taking initiative and responsibility in addressing the issue. "Confront him privately" underscores the importance of discretion and respect for the individual's dignity. This approach aligns with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/proverbs/25-9.htm">Proverbs 25:9</a>, which advises resolving disputes directly and privately. The goal is reconciliation without public embarrassment or gossip.<p><b>If he listens to you</b><br>Listening implies not just hearing but understanding and acknowledging the wrongdoing. This phrase highlights the importance of open communication and the willingness to resolve conflicts. In the biblical context, listening is often associated with obedience and repentance (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19-20</a>). The act of listening is a step towards reconciliation and healing within the community.<p><b>you have won your brother over</b><br>The phrase "won your brother over" suggests a successful reconciliation and restoration of the relationship. This reflects the redemptive nature of Christian community, where forgiveness and restoration are paramount. The language of "winning" echoes Paul's writings, where he speaks of winning others for Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>). It emphasizes the victory of love and unity over division and strife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this teaching, providing guidance on how to handle personal offenses within the Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother.htm">Brother</a></b><br>Refers to a fellow believer or member of the Christian community, emphasizing the familial relationship among Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/private_confrontation.htm">Private Confrontation</a></b><br>The initial step in addressing sin, highlighting the importance of discretion and personal responsibility in resolving conflicts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_direct_communication.htm">The Importance of Direct Communication</a></b><br>Jesus instructs us to address issues directly with the person involved, avoiding gossip and unnecessary public exposure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_goal_of_restoration.htm">The Goal of Restoration</a></b><br>The ultimate aim is to restore the relationship and bring the brother back into right standing, not to condemn or shame.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_humility_and_love.htm">The Role of Humility and Love</a></b><br>Approaching someone privately requires humility and love, recognizing our own imperfections and the need for grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_listening.htm">The Power of Listening</a></b><br>The passage highlights the importance of listening, both for the one confronting and the one being confronted, as a means to achieve understanding and reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_the_believer.htm">The Responsibility of the Believer</a></b><br>Each believer is called to take personal responsibility in addressing sin, reflecting the communal nature of the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_18_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 18:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_18_15_Church_conflict_resolution.htm">How does Matthew 18:15 guide us in resolving conflicts within the church?

(1.) The presence of "offences" implies sin, and the question arises how each man is to deal with those sins which affect himself personally. (2.) The dispute in which the teaching recorded in this chapter had originated implied that the unity of the society which was then represented by the Twelve, had for the time been broken. Each of the disciples thought himself, in some sense, aggrieved by others. Sharp words, it may be, had been spoken among them, and the breach had to be healed.<p><span class= "bld">Go and tell him his fault.</span>--The Greek is somewhat stronger, <span class= "ital">convict him of his fault,</span> press it home on him in such a way as to reach his reason and his conscience. (Comp. <a href="/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>.) But this is to be done "between thee and him alone." Angry words spoken in the presence of others would fail of that result. It is significant that the substance of the precept is taken from the passage in Leviticus (<a href="/context/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17-18</a>) which ends with "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast gained thy brother.</span>--The words in part derive their force from the subtle use of a word in one sense which men associated commonly with another. "Gain" of some kind, aimed at, or wrongfully withheld, was commonly the origin of disputes and litigation. A man hoped to reap some profit by going to law. In the more excellent way which our Lord points out, he would by sacrificing the lower gain, attain the higher, and win for God (see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1Corinthians 9:19</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>, for this aspect of the word) and for himself the brother with whom he had been at variance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Correction of an offending brother</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Hitherto the discourse has warned against offending the young and weak; it now teaches how to behave when the offence is directed against one's self. <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, "now," introducing a new subject) <span class="cmt_word">if thy brother shall trespass against</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;</span>). The brother is a brother in the faith, a fellow Christian. The words, "against thee," are omitted in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts, and by some modern editors, on the ground that it is a gloss derived from Peter's question (ver. 21). The words are retained by the Vulgate and other high authorities. Without them, the passage becomes one of a general nature, applying to all offences. Retaining them, we find a direction how to treat one who offers personal offence to ourselves - which seems to suit the context best. In the case of private quarrels between individual Christians, with the view of reconciliation, there are four steps to be taken. First, private remonstrance: <span class="cmt_word">Go</span>. Do not wait for him to come to you; make the first advances yourself. This, as being the more difficult course, is expressly enjoined on one who is learning the lesson of humility. <span class="cmt_word">Tell him his fault;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>,: <span class="accented">corripe eum</span>. Put the fault plainly before him, show him how he has wronged you, and how he has offended God. This must be done in private, gently, mercifully. Such treatment may win the heart, while public rebuke, open denunciation, might only incense and harden. Plainly, the Lord primarily contemplates quarrels between individual Christians; though, indeed, the advice here and in the sequel is applicable to a wider sphere and to more important occasions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast gained thy brother.</span> If he shall own his fault, and ask for pardon, thou hast won him for God and thyself. A quarrel is a loss to both parties; a reconciliation is a gain for both.
