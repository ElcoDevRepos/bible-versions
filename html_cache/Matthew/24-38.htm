The "days before the flood" were marked by moral decay and a departure from God's ways, leading to divine judgment. This context sets the stage for understanding the severity of the flood as a response to human sinfulness. The flood narrative is a type of final judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment at the end of the age.<p><b>people were eating and drinking</b><br>This phrase highlights the normalcy and routine of daily life during that time. Eating and drinking are basic human activities, suggesting that people were living without awareness or concern for the impending judgment. This mirrors the complacency and indifference that can characterize societies unaware of spiritual realities. The reference to eating and drinking also connects to other biblical warnings about being spiritually alert, such as in <a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>.<p><b>marrying and giving in marriage</b><br>Marriage is a God-ordained institution, and this phrase indicates that life was continuing as usual, with people planning for the future without recognizing the looming disaster. The mention of marriage underscores the idea of societal continuity and normalcy, despite the moral corruption present. This can be seen as a parallel to the days of Lot, as mentioned in <a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28</a>, where similar activities were occurring before sudden destruction.<p><b>up to the day Noah entered the ark</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the suddenness and unexpected nature of the flood's arrival. Noah's entry into the ark marks the moment of divine intervention and the closing of the opportunity for repentance. It highlights Noah's obedience and faith, as he acted on God's warning despite the apparent normalcy around him. The ark itself is a type of Christ, offering salvation and refuge from judgment for those who enter. Noah's entry signifies the separation between the righteous and the wicked, a theme echoed in the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve humanity and animal life.

When Noah entered the ark, the opportunity to repent vanished, and judgment fell without delay. Jesus applies that pattern to His return: normal routines will lull many into complacency, but a decisive, final moment is coming. The passage urges watchfulness, readiness, and unwavering trust in God&#8217;s Word, which proves true in every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were eating,</span> etc. The Lord describes the reckless way in which men went on their usual course, pursued their pleasures and avocations, with the doom. hanging over them, in spite of the warning given.
