His recognition of Jesus' sinlessness and divine nature led him to hesitate. This moment highlights John's humility and understanding of Jesus' superiority. The act of trying to prevent Jesus underscores John's awareness of his own unworthiness compared to the Messiah. This reflects the prophetic role of John as described in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, preparing the way for the Lord.<p><b>saying, &#8220;I need to be baptized by You</b><br>John acknowledges his own need for spiritual cleansing and renewal, recognizing Jesus as the source of true baptism, which is not just with water but with the Holy Spirit and fire (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). This statement reveals John's understanding of Jesus' divine authority and the transformative power of His ministry. It also points to the concept of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest, who offers a baptism that cleanses from sin, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>and do You come to me?&#8221;</b><br>John's question emphasizes the reversal of roles, where the greater (Jesus) comes to the lesser (John) for baptism. This act of humility by Jesus prefigures His ultimate act of humility on the cross (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>). It also fulfills all righteousness, as Jesus identifies with humanity's sinfulness despite being sinless Himself.

Since Jesus was sinless (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>), John saw no reason for Jesus to submit to a baptism meant for repentant sinners.<p>- John had already testified, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Recognizing Jesus as the spotless sacrifice, he naturally hesitated to baptize the One whose mission was to remove sin, not confess it.<p>- This moment highlights John&#8217;s humility, echoing his later words, &#8220;He must increase; I must decrease&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>- John&#8217;s objection is not mere formality; it is the sincere cry of a servant who feels unworthy. Similar reverence appears when Peter exclaims, &#8220;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>).<p>- The dialog underscores the personal nature of Jesus&#8217; ministry. Unlike distant deities, the Son of God converses with His followers (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>), inviting relationship rather than ritual alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I need to be baptized by You</b><p>- John sees his own need for the greater baptism Jesus will bring&#8212;&#8220;He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>).<p>- His confession mirrors the universal human condition: &#8220;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Even the greatest prophet (<a href="/luke/7-28.htm">Luke 7:28</a>) needs cleansing that only Christ provides.<p>- Jesus alone fulfills righteousness (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>); therefore, He&#8212;not John&#8212;holds the authority to impart true spiritual cleansing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and do You come to me?</b><p>- John marvels at the humility of the Messiah. <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a> describes Jesus &#8220;taking the very nature of a servant.&#8221;<p>- The question captures the wonder that the Holy One would willingly step into the waters of repentance, prefiguring how He would later bear our sins on the cross (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p>- Jesus&#8217; act models submission to the Father&#8217;s plan (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>) and inaugurates His public ministry, identifying with the people He came to save (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/3-14.htm">Matthew 3:14</a> records John&#8217;s heartfelt attempt to stop Jesus from receiving a baptism meant for sinners. John&#8217;s hesitation springs from humility, an awareness of his own need for cleansing, and a recognition of Christ&#8217;s sinless supremacy. Jesus&#8217; request reveals His willingness to identify with humanity, setting the stage for His redemptive work. The verse invites us to marvel at the humility of the Savior who enters our world, our water, and ultimately our sin, so that we might be washed clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">John forbad him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">sought to hinder Him.</span> Here again we have a question which we cannot fully answer. Did John thus forbid Him, as knowing Him to be the Christ? If so, how did that knowledge come? Had they known each other before, in youth or manhood? Or did a special inspiration reveal the character of Him who now drew near? The narrative of St. Matthew seems to imply such knowledge. On the other hand, the words of the Baptist in <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a> not only imply, but assert that he did not know Him till after the wonders of the Baptism. Probably, therefore, the sequence of facts was this: The Lord Jesus came to be baptised, as others did, though not, it would seem, with others. He confessed no sins. Look and tone, and words and silence alike spoke of a sinless and stainless life, such as even in approximate instances impresses us with something like awe in presence of the majesty of holiness. Recognising that holiness the Baptist spake as he did, "I have need to be baptised of Thee, to sit at Thy feet, learning lessons of purity and change of heart from Thee."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Vers. 14 and 15 are peculiar to St. Matthew. <span class="cmt_word">But John</span>. In <a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31, 33</a> the Baptist says that he knew him not till the descent of the Holy Spirit; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> knew him not in his full Messianic character. Here, <span class="accented">either</span> by an involuntary and miraculous impression, psychologically due to the previous revelation he had received (cf. Meyer); or, as is on the whole more probable, from his previous knowledge, direct or indirect, of Jesus, he recognizes his superior sanctity. John's inmost thoughts must therefore have been somewhat as follows. "I have come to announce the advent of Messiah; here is One who is much holier than I; it may be that he is Messiah, but I have no certainty till the sign promised has been vouchsafed." <span class="cmt_word">Forbade</span>; <span class="accented">would have hindered</span> (Revised Version), for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, does not in itself imply speech. (For a similar imperfect of that which was not fully carried out, cf. <a href="/luke/1-59.htm">Luke 1:59</a>.) It is noticeable, though doubtless merely as a coincidence, that the strong compound word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> also occur together in Judith 12:7. <span class="cmt_word">I have need to be baptized of thee</span>. Many see here a reference to the baptism of the Spirit and fire, mentioned in ver. 11. But the following clause, "and dost thou come to me?" implies that the baptisms are identical, viz. baptism by water. The sentence is equivalent to "I John, who myself administer the baptism of repentance, need to profess repentance myself, and ought rather, therefore, to receive such a baptism at thy hands, who art so far holier than I" (cf. further Weiss, 'Life,' 1:320). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">John</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;ann&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Joannes, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tried to prevent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#954;&#974;&#955;&#965;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(diek&#333;lyen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1254.htm">Strong's 1254: </a> </span><span class="str2">To obstinately prevent, hinder.
