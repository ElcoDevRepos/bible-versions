His credentials suggest he should recognize Messiah when He sees Him (<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>).<p>- His expertise implies:<p>&#8226; He knows the Torah and the prophets inside out (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; He is accustomed to debating fine points of commandment-keeping (<a href="/mark/7-5.htm">Mark 7:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>- Ironically, the more he prides himself on knowledge, the more he misses the Author of that Law standing in front of him (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>tested Him</b><p>- The verb points to motive, not curiosity. Like Satan in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>), the Pharisees&#8217; agenda is to trip Jesus up.<p>- Earlier tests:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Is it lawful to divorce&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Show us a sign from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>).<p>- Each trial ends with Jesus exposing hearts (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).

Here it is the latter, yet Jesus still answers, revealing grace even toward challengers (<a href="/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21-25</a>).<p>- The tactic:<p>&#8226; Frame a theological dilemma.<p>&#8226; Force Jesus to choose a side.<p>&#8226; Discredit Him whichever way He answers (<a href="/mark/12-13.htm">Mark 12:13</a>).<p>- Instead, the question (&#8220;Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?&#8221; <a href="/matthew/22-36.htm">Matthew 22:36</a>) becomes a doorway for Jesus to affirm <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, summarizing the entire Law and Prophets.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/22-35.htm">Matthew 22:35</a> shows one Pharisee, credentialed and confident, stepping out from his peers to test Jesus with a calculated question. The verse exposes motives&#8212;testing rather than seeking&#8212;but also sets the stage for Jesus to reveal the heart of God&#8217;s Law. What begins as an attempt to entangle Christ becomes an opportunity for Him to declare that love for God and neighbor is the pinnacle of every command.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">A lawyer.</span>--The precise distinction between the "lawyer" and the other scribes rested, probably, on technicalities that have left little or no trace behind them. The word suggests the thought of a section of the scribes who confined their attention to the Law, while the others included in their studies the writings of the Prophets also. In <a href="/luke/7-30.htm" title="But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.">Luke 7:30</a>; <a href="/luke/11-45.htm" title="Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying you reproach us also.">Luke 11:45</a>, they appear as distinct from the Pharisees. The question asked by the "lawyer" here and in <a href="/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25</a> falls in with this view. So it would seem, in <a href="/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>, that Zenas the "lawyer" was sent for to settle the strivings about the Law that prevailed in Crete.<p><span class= "bld">Tempting him.</span>--There does not appear to have been in this instance any hostile purpose in the mind of the questioner; nor does the word necessarily imply it. (Comp. <a href="/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?">2Corinthians 13:5</a>, where it is used in the sense of "trying," "examining.") It would seem, indeed, as if our Lord's refutation of the Sadducees had drawn out a certain measure of sympathy and reverence from those whose minds were not hardened in hypocrisy. They came now to test His teaching on other points. What answer would He give to the much-debated question of the schools, as to which was the great commandment of the Law? Would He fix on circumcision, or the Sabbath, or tithes, or sacrifice, as that which held the place of pre-eminence? The fact that they thus, as it were, examined Him as if they were His judges, showed an utterly imperfect recognition of His claims as a Prophet and as the Christ; but the "lawyer" who appeared as their representative was, at least, honest in his purpose, and "not far from the kingdom of God" (<a href="/mark/12-34.htm" title="And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.">Mark 12:34</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A lawyer;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, called by St. Mark "a scribe" - a term of wider signification, which would include "lawyers." Vulgate, <span class="accented">legis doctor</span>, which gives the right sense; for such were teachers and expounders of the Mosaic Law. This man was put forth by the Pharisees as an expert, who would not be so easily discomfited as the Sadducees had been. <span class="cmt_word">Tempting him.</span> Trying him (comp. <a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>); putting him to the test, not altogether maliciously, but partly from curiosity, and partly from a desire to hear Christ's opinion on a much disputed point. It is evident, from St. Mark's account, that Christ was pleased with him personally, for he said to him, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Those who put this lawyer forward had, of course, sinister motives, and hoped to make capital from Christ's answer; but the man himself seems to have been straightforward and honest. We have had the terra "tempting" used in a hostile sense (<a href="/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>), but there is no necessity for so taking it; and it seems to imply here merely the renewal of the attack on Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
