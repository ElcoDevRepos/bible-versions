It is not limited to specific situations or relationships but applies universally. The use of "everything" suggests that this principle should govern all aspects of life, reflecting the holistic nature of biblical ethics. This aligns with the biblical teaching that God's commandments are not just for religious observance but for every part of life (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-9</a>).<p><b>do to others</b><br>This directive is proactive, urging believers to take the initiative in treating others well. It reflects the biblical principle of love for one's neighbor, which is central to the teachings of both the Old and New Testaments (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>). The focus on "others" underscores the communal aspect of biblical ethics, where relationships and community are paramount.<p><b>as you would have them do to you.</b><br>This is commonly known as the "Golden Rule." It is a call to empathy and understanding, encouraging individuals to consider their own desires and needs when interacting with others. This principle is found in various forms in other religious and philosophical traditions, but its placement here within the context of Jesus' teachings gives it a distinctively Christian interpretation, rooted in love and selflessness (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p><b>For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.</b><br>This statement connects the teaching to the broader biblical narrative. The "Law and the Prophets" is a term that encompasses the entire Old Testament, indicating that this principle summarizes the ethical teachings of Scripture. It reflects Jesus' teaching that love fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>, <a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>). This connection highlights the continuity between Jesus' teachings and the Old Testament, affirming that the call to love and ethical living is central to God's revelation throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, representing followers of Christ who are learning the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_and_the_prophets.htm">The Law and the Prophets</a></b><br>A reference to the Hebrew Scriptures, encompassing the moral and ethical teachings that Jesus fulfills and expounds upon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, a collection of Jesus' teachings found in Matthew chapters 5-7, addressing the nature of true righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_rule.htm">The Golden Rule</a></b><br>A term often used to describe this verse, emphasizing its universal ethical principle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_essence_of_the_law_and_prophets.htm">The Essence of the Law and Prophets</a></b><br>Jesus summarizes the ethical teachings of the Old Testament, highlighting that true righteousness is relational and rooted in love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_principle.htm">Universal Principle</a></b><br>The Golden Rule is a timeless and cross-cultural principle that applies to all human interactions, reflecting God's desire for justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_love.htm">Active Love</a></b><br>This teaching calls for proactive love, not merely refraining from harm but actively seeking the good of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflection_of_god's_character.htm">Reflection of God's Character</a></b><br>By living out this principle, believers reflect the character of God, who is loving, just, and merciful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_discipleship.htm">Practical Discipleship</a></b><br>Applying this rule in daily life is a practical expression of discipleship, demonstrating the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_7_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 7:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_7_12_daily_with_others.htm">How can we implement Matthew 7:12 in daily interactions with others?

In doing so, we live out the central intent of God&#8217;s Law, displaying a love that reflects His character and fulfills His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Therefore . . . whatsoever.</span>--The sequence of thought requires, perhaps, some explanation. God gives His good things in answer to our wishes, if only what we wish for is really for our good. It is man's highest blessedness to be like God, to "be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect," and therefore in this respect too he must strive to resemble Him. The ground thus taken gives a new character to that which otherwise had already become almost one of the "common-places" of Jewish and heathen ethics. Perhaps the most interesting illustration of the former is the well-known story of the Gentile inquirer who went to Shammai, the great scribe, and asked to be taught the law, in a few brief words, while he stood on one foot. The Rabbi turned away in anger. The questioner then went to Hillel, and made the same demand; and the sage turned and said, "Whatsoever thou wouldest that men should not do to thee, that do not thou to them. All our law is summed up in that." And so the Gentile became a proselyte. A like negative rule is quoted by Gibbon (<span class= "ital">Decl. and Fall,</span> c. liv., note 2) from Isocrates, not without a sneer, as if it anticipated the teaching of the Christ. The nearest approach to our Lord's rule is, however, found in the saying ascribed to Aristotle, who, when asked how we should act towards our friends, replied, "As we would they should act to us" (Diog. Laert., v. 1, ? 21). All these, however, though we may welcome them as instances of the <span class= "ital">testimonium animae naturaliter Christianae</span> (as Tertullian calls it), are yet wanting in the completeness of our Lord's precept, and still more do they fall below it in regard of the ground on which the precept rests, and the power given to perform it. Yet even here, too, there is, of necessity, an implied limitation. We cannot comply with all men's desires, nor ought we to wish that they should comply with ours, for those desires may be foolish and frivolous, or may involve the indulgence of lust or passion. The rule is only safe when our own will has been first purified, so that we wish only from others that which is really good. Reciprocity in evil or in folly is obviously altogether alien from the mind of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Ver. 12<span class="accented">a</span>, parallel passage: <a href="/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>; <a href="/luke/12.htm">Luke 12</a>b, Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">things therefore</span>. <span class="accented">Therefore.</span> Summing up the lesson of vers. 1-11 (cf. ver. 7, note).

Not "these things" do ye to them; for our Lord carefully avoids any expression that might lead to a legal enumeration of different details, but "thus" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), referring to the character of your own wishes. (For this "golden rule," cf. Tobit 4:15 (negative form); cf. also patristic references in Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 95, 135.) On the occasional similarity of pre-Christian writings to the teaching of our Lord, Augustine (<span class="accented">vide</span> Trench, 'Serm.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) well says it is "the glory of the written and spoken law, that it is the transcript of that which was from the first, and not merely as old as this man or that, but as the Creation itself, a reproduction of that obscured and forgotten law written at the beginning by the finger of God on the hearts of all men. When, therefore, heathen sages or poets proclaimed any part of this, they had not thereby anticipated Christ; they had only deciphered some fragment of that law, which he gave from the first, and which, when men, exiles and fugitives from themselves and from the knowledge of their own hearts, had lost the power of reading, he came in the flesh to read to them anew, and to bring out the well-nigh obliterated characters afresh."
