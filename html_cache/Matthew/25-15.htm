Historically, a single talent was worth about 6,000 denarii, with a denarius being a day's wage for a laborer. This indicates the master's trust and the value of what he entrusted to his servants. Theologically, the talents can symbolize the gifts, opportunities, and responsibilities God gives to individuals. The number five suggests a substantial trust, indicating the servant's capability and the master's confidence in him.<p><b>to another two talents</b><br>The distribution of two talents to the second servant reflects the master's discernment in giving according to each servant's capacity. This allocation underscores the principle of stewardship, where each person is given resources in line with their ability to manage them. Biblically, this can be seen as a call to faithfulness, regardless of the amount entrusted. The number two, while less than five, still represents a significant trust and opportunity for service and growth.<p><b>and to another one talent</b><br>The servant receiving one talent still holds a considerable amount, emphasizing that even the least amount given is valuable. This highlights the idea that no gift or responsibility from God is insignificant. Theologically, it challenges believers to recognize and utilize whatever they have been given, no matter how small it may seem. The single talent serves as a test of faithfulness and initiative.<p><b>each according to his own ability</b><br>This phrase indicates the master's wisdom and fairness in distributing resources. It reflects the biblical principle that God knows each person's strengths and limitations and assigns responsibilities accordingly. This aligns with passages like <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>, which speak of diverse gifts given by the Spirit for the common good. It emphasizes personal accountability and the expectation that one should work within their God-given capacity.<p><b>And he went on his journey</b><br>The master's departure signifies a period of testing and opportunity for the servants. It parallels the ascension of Christ and the current age where believers are entrusted with the gospel and the kingdom's work until His return. This time of absence is a test of faithfulness and diligence, as seen in other parables like the Parable of the Ten Virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). It underscores the importance of being prepared and active in service, anticipating the master's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Represents God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with resources and responsibilities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or followers of Christ, each given different amounts of resources or responsibilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/talents.htm">Talents</a></b><br>A large sum of money in biblical times, symbolizing the gifts, abilities, and opportunities God gives to each person.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/journey.htm">Journey</a></b><br>The master's departure represents Christ's ascension and the period before His return, during which believers are to be faithful stewards.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/distribution_of_talents.htm">Distribution of Talents</a></b><br>The act of giving talents according to each servant's ability highlights God's wisdom and fairness in distributing gifts and responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>God entrusts each believer with specific gifts and responsibilities.

The verse calls for gratitude over what we have received, faithfulness in using it, and readiness to give an account when the Master returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Unto one he gave five talents.</span>--On the value of the talent see the Note on <a href="/matthew/18-24.htm" title="And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, which owed him ten thousand talents.">Matthew 18:24</a>. The languages of modern Europe bear witness, in their use of the word, to the impression which the parable has made. A man's energies, gifts, capacities, are the "talents," for the use of which he will have to render an account. We speak, though in this case the word is hardly more than an ill-coined vulgarism, of him who possesses them as "talented." Common, however, as this use of the word is, it tends to obscure the true meaning of the parable. Here there is an "ability" presupposed in each case, prior to the distribution of the talents, and we are led accordingly to the conclusion that the latter stand here less for natural gifts than for external opportunities--for possessions, offices, what we call "spheres of duty." These, we are told, are, in the wisdom of God, given to men, in the long run, "according to their several ability." So taken, the parable does not repeat the lesson of that which precedes it, but is addressed, not as that is to all Christians, but specifically to those who hold any vocation or ministry in the Church of Christ, or have in their hands outward resources for working in it. It is, perhaps, not altogether fanciful to trace, as a first application, in the three-fold scale of distribution, a correspondence with the three groups, four in each, into which the twelve Apostles were divided. The sons of Jona and of Zebedee were as those who had received five talents; the less conspicuous middle group answered to those who received but two; while the "wicked and slothful servant" finds his representative in the only disciple in the third, or last group, who is at all conspicuous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto one he gave five talents.</span> The talent of silver (taking silver as worth a little over 5s. an ounce) was nearly equivalent to &pound;400 of our money. It is from the use of the word "talents" in this parable that we moderns have derived its common meaning of natural gifts and endowments. The three principal slaves receive a certain amount of property to use for their master's profit. <span class="cmt_word">To every man.</span> To all is given some grace or faculty which they have to employ to the glory of God. "Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ "(<a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>). No one can justly say he is neglected in this distribution. Whatever natural powers, etc., we possess, and the opportunities of exercising and improving them, are the gift of God, and are delivered to us to be put out to interest. <span class="cmt_word">According to his several ability</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The master apportioned his gifts in accordance with his knowledge of the slaves' capacity for business, and the probability of their rightly employing much or little capital. So God distributes his endowments, not to all alike, but in such proportions as men are able to bear and to profit by. The infinite variety in men's dispositions, intellects, will. opportunities, position, and so on, are all taken into account, and modify and condition their responsibility. <span class="cmt_word">Straightway took his journey</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). Immediately after the distribution he departed, leaving each slave, uncontrolled and undirected, to use the property assigned to him. So God gives us free will at the same time that he sets before us opportunities of showing our faithfulness. The Lord may be referring primarily to the apostles whom he left immediately after he had bestowed upon them authority and commission. The Revised Version, Westcott and Hort, Nosgen, and others transfer the adverb "straightway" to the beginning of the next verse (omitting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in that verse). It is supposed to be superfluous here. The Vulgate accords with the Received Text; and there seems to be no sufficient reason for accentuating the first slave's activity above that of the second, who was equally faithful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8103;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he gave</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ed&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
