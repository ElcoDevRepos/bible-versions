The question of its source challenges the religious leaders to consider whether John's authority was divine or merely human. This reflects the broader theme of divine authority versus human tradition, a recurring issue in Jesus' ministry. John's role as a forerunner to Christ is prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, emphasizing his divine mission.<p><b>Was it from heaven or from men?&#8221;</b><br>The dichotomy presented here&#8212;heaven or men&#8212;forces the religious leaders to confront the origin of spiritual authority. "From heaven" implies divine endorsement, while "from men" suggests human invention. This question highlights the tension between acknowledging God's work and maintaining human control. The leaders' struggle to answer reveals their fear of losing authority and their unwillingness to accept divine intervention that challenges their status quo.<p><b>They deliberated among themselves and said,</b><br>The act of deliberation indicates the leaders' internal conflict and political maneuvering. Their discussion is not about seeking truth but about preserving their power and influence. This reflects the broader cultural and religious context of first-century Judea, where religious leaders often prioritized tradition and authority over genuine spiritual insight.<p><b>&#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; He will ask,</b><br>Acknowledging John's baptism as "from heaven" would validate his message and, by extension, Jesus' ministry. This admission would undermine the leaders' authority and challenge their rejection of both John and Jesus. The leaders' fear of this question reveals their awareness of the truth yet their unwillingness to accept it due to the implications for their power and control.<p><b>&#8216;Why then did you not believe him?&#8217;</b><br>This question underscores the leaders' hypocrisy and lack of faith. Belief in John's message would naturally lead to acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah, as John pointed to Jesus as the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Their failure to believe highlights their spiritual blindness and resistance to God's plan.

At one time they came to his baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a>); at another they said, "He hath a devil" (<a href="/matthew/11-18.htm" title="For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.">Matthew 11:18</a>). They watched the ebb and flow of a public reverence which the death of John had deepened, and dared not repudiate his character as a prophet. They were reluctant to admit that character, for this would have involved the necessity of accepting the testimony which he had borne to the work and office of Jesus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The baptism of John</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). By "the baptism which was of John" Christ means his whole ministry, doctrine, preaching, etc.; as by circumcision is implied the whole Mosaic Law, and the doctrine of the cross comprises all the teaching of the gospel, the chief characteristic connoting all particulars. <span class="cmt_word">From heaven, or of men?</span> Did they regard John as one inspired and commissioned by God, or as a fanatic and impostor, who was self-sent and had received no external authorization? Now, two facts were plain and could not be denied. The rulers and the people with them had allowed John to be a prophet, and had never questioned his claims hitherto. This was one fact; the other was that John had borne unmistakable evidence to Christ. "Behold the Lamb of God!" etc. (<a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-36</a>), he had said. He came and asserted that he came as Christ's forerunner; his mission was to prepare Christ's way, and had no meaning or intention but this. Here was a dilemma. They had asked for Jesus' credentials; the prophet, whose mission they had virtually endorsed testified that Jesus was the Messiah; if they believed that John spoke by inspiration, they must accept Christ; if now they discredited John, they would stultify themselves and endanger their influence with the people. <span class="cmt_word">They reasoned with themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The somewhat unusual introduction of this preposition instead of the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> implies that the reflection was not confined to their own breast, but passed in consultation from one to another. They saw the difficulty, and deliberated how they could meet it without compromising themselves, seeking, not truth, but evasion. <span class="cmt_word">Why did ye not then</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">why then did ye not</span>) <span class="cmt_word">believe him?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when he bore such plain testimony to me. This appeal could be silenced only by denying John's mission, or asserting that he was mistaken in what he said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What was the source</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pothen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4159.htm">Strong's 4159: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of posis with enclitic adverb of origin; from which or what place, state, source or cause.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
