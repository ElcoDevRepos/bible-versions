The phrase "Bring them here to Me" signifies Jesus' invitation to involve Him in the situation. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God invites His people to bring their needs and resources to Him, trusting in His provision. The act of bringing the loaves and fish to Jesus symbolizes surrender and faith, acknowledging that human resources are insufficient without divine intervention. This mirrors the Old Testament instances where God provided for His people, such as manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>Jesus said.</b><br>The authority of Jesus is emphasized here. His words are not merely suggestions but carry the weight of divine command. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus' words bring about miraculous changes, such as calming storms (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and healing the sick (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>). This phrase also highlights Jesus' role as the Good Shepherd, who cares for His flock and provides for their needs. In the broader context of <a href="/matthew/14.htm">Matthew 14</a>, this miracle prefigures the Last Supper and the Eucharist, where Jesus provides spiritual nourishment. Jesus' command to bring the loaves and fish to Him foreshadows His ultimate provision through His sacrifice on the cross, fulfilling the prophecies of a Messiah who would shepherd and feed His people (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is about to perform the miracle of feeding the five thousand.

In the face of a crowd of more than five thousand (<a href="/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>), He does not tell the disciples to invent a solution; He tells them to take what they already have and place it under His authority.<p>&#8226; The command demands faith-filled obedience, just as Elijah required the widow to &#8220;first make me a small cake&#8221; before her flour and oil multiplied (<a href="/1_kings/17-13.htm">1 Kings 17:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; It affirms God&#8217;s pattern of using what seems insufficient&#8212;Gideon&#8217;s three hundred men (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>), Elisha&#8217;s twenty barley loaves (<a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a>), the widow&#8217;s two copper coins (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds believers that everything we steward ultimately belongs to the Lord (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>). When He says &#8220;Bring,&#8221; we respond without reservation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>them here</b><p>The resources&#8212;and the need&#8212;must be relocated into Jesus&#8217; immediate presence.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Here&#8221; indicates nearness. Only when the loaves and fish leave the disciples&#8217; hands and stand before Christ can His power touch them. Compare the leper who came and knelt &#8220;before Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>) and the parents who carried their children so that He might lay hands on them (<a href="/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Moving the problem to Jesus replaces anxiety with expectancy, echoing the invitation, &#8220;Cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a> says, &#8220;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.&#8221; Physical proximity in the narrative underscores spiritual closeness for the believer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Me</b><p>The spotlight shifts from the magnitude of the crowd to the sufficiency of the Savior.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself is the destination; provision flows from His person. As He later declares, &#8220;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to Me will never hunger&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;To Me&#8221; refutes the temptation to rely on human ingenuity. The disciples might have dispersed the crowd (<a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15</a>), yet Christ insists the solution rests in Him alone, echoing <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase showcases His divine authority over creation, foreshadowing that &#8220;in Him all things hold together&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). Resources, needs, and people find completion only when brought to Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus said</b><p>The miracle is initiated not by human effort but by the spoken word of the Son of God.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, divine speech precedes divine action&#8212;&#8220;And God said&#8230; and it was so&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3-31</a>); &#8220;Only say the word, and my servant will be healed&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; His command carries the same authority later displayed when He calms the storm with &#8220;Peace! Be still!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and calls Lazarus from the tomb (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Because &#8220;the word of the Lord stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a>), believers can trust every directive He gives, whether to ancient disciples or to us through Scripture today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-18.htm">Matthew 14:18</a> reveals a four-fold pattern for faith. Christ commands us to bring what we possess, relocate it into His presence, center everything on Him, and heed His authoritative word. The verse underscores that literal obedience unlocks supernatural provision, affirming Jesus as the all-sufficient Lord who still multiplies surrendered resources for the good of many and the glory of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">He said, Bring them hither to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>).

"Yes," he says, "it is possible to feed them where we are, and especially where I am. For there is not the poverty of supply here that you think there is."
