The sending of more servants represents the prophets sent by God throughout Israel's history, as seen in the Old Testament. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were sent to call Israel back to faithfulness. The increase in the number of servants highlights God's abundant grace and mercy, despite Israel's repeated disobedience. This action reflects God's desire for repentance and reconciliation, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>, where God persistently sent messengers to His people.<p><b>But the tenants did the same to them.</b><br>The tenants' repeated mistreatment of the servants symbolizes Israel's historical rejection and persecution of the prophets. This behavior is a reflection of the hard-heartedness and rebellion of the people, as seen in passages like <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a> and <a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>, where the prophets were often met with hostility. The tenants' actions foreshadow the ultimate rejection of Jesus Christ, the Son, by the religious leaders of His time. This rejection is a fulfillment of the prophecy found in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men.
