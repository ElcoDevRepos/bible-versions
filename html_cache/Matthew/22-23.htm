It is part of a series of confrontations with religious leaders in Jerusalem during the final week of His earthly ministry, often referred to as Passion Week.<p><b>the Sadducees</b><br>The Sadducees were a Jewish sect known for their aristocratic status and control of the Temple in Jerusalem. They were distinct from the Pharisees, holding different theological views, particularly denying the resurrection, angels, and spirits. Their influence was significant in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council.<p><b>who say there is no resurrection</b><br>This belief was a defining characteristic of the Sadducees, setting them apart from the Pharisees, who affirmed the resurrection. The Sadducees' denial of the resurrection is rooted in their strict adherence to the Torah, where they claimed the concept was not explicitly mentioned. This theological stance is crucial in understanding their challenge to Jesus.<p><b>came to Jesus</b><br>The Sadducees approach Jesus with the intent to challenge His teachings and authority. This encounter is part of a broader narrative where various groups attempt to discredit Jesus. Their approach is not out of genuine inquiry but rather to trap Him in His words.<p><b>and questioned Him</b><br>The questioning by the Sadducees is a strategic move to undermine Jesus' credibility. They present a hypothetical scenario based on the Levirate marriage law from <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, aiming to ridicule the concept of resurrection.

The form of their attack implies that they looked on our Lord as teaching the doctrine of the resurrection. They rested their denial on the ground that they found no mention of it in the Law, which they recognised as the only rule of faith.

The received reading historically describes the Sadducees' opinions; the other makes them come boldly stating their sentiments. Where authorities are pretty evenly balanced, we must decide the wording of a passage by other than literary considerations; and there can be no doubt that the reading which denotes the characteristic of the sect is more appropriate than that which represents them offensively parading their views as a preparation for the coming question. We have had notice of the Saddueees before (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>). The popular account of their religious belief is given in <a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>, "The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit." They were rationalists and sceptics, who denied many old-established truths, and scorned many prevalent observances. They acknowledged most of the Old Testament, though, curiously enough, they, like our modern neologians, stumbled at the supernatural upon which the Scriptures were built. Tradition and traditional interpretations found no favour with them. The future life of the soul they utterly repudiated, and the resurrection of the body, when it was brought before them, met with contemptuous ridicule. The claims and doctrine of Christ were, in their eyes, puerile and unworthy of philosophic consideration. At the same time, they recognized that the people were with him for the moment, and that it was expedient that his teaching, so utterly opposed to their own opinions, should be discredited and repressed. So they came forward asking an imaginary question, which, as they thought, would reduce to an absurdity the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the flesh. Doubtless they were members of the Sanhedrin, and it was at the instigation of this body that they proposed the presumed case of conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(ekein&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1565.htm">Strong's 1565: </a> </span><span class="str2">That, that one there, yonder.
