Jesus addresses the disciples' lack of faith, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. The disciples had been unable to cast out a demon, and Jesus attributes this failure to their insufficient faith. This highlights the importance of faith in the life of a believer, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. The disciples' struggle with faith is a reminder of the human tendency to doubt and the need for reliance on God.<p><b>For truly I tell you,</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and truthfulness of Jesus' words. It is a common expression used by Jesus to emphasize the importance and certainty of His teachings. The use of "truly" (or "verily" in some translations) is a solemn affirmation, indicating that what follows is a foundational truth for the disciples and all believers.<p><b>if you have faith the size of a mustard seed,</b><br>The mustard seed is one of the smallest seeds known in the region, symbolizing something very small yet potent. Jesus uses this metaphor to illustrate that even a small amount of genuine faith can have great power. This imagery is consistent with other teachings of Jesus, such as the parable of the mustard seed in <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>, where the kingdom of heaven is likened to a mustard seed that grows into a large tree.<p><b>you can say to this mountain, &#8216;Move from here to there,&#8217; and it will move.</b><br>Mountains often symbolize insurmountable obstacles or challenges. Jesus uses hyperbolic language to convey that faith can overcome great difficulties. The specific mention of "this mountain" may refer to the Mount of Transfiguration or another nearby mountain, emphasizing the tangible reality of faith's power. This teaching is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, where Paul speaks of faith that can move mountains, highlighting the transformative potential of faith in action.<p><b>Nothing will be impossible for you.</b><br>This statement reinforces the limitless possibilities available through faith in God. It aligns with other biblical promises, such as <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, which declares that believers can do all things through Christ who strengthens them. The emphasis is on God's power working through the believer's faith, rather than human ability alone. This assurance encourages believers to trust in God's sovereignty and power, even in seemingly impossible situations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, providing a teaching moment to His disciples about the power of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being instructed on the importance and potential of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mustard_seed.htm">The Mustard Seed</a></b><br>A small seed used metaphorically by Jesus to illustrate the power of even a small amount of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>Symbolic of seemingly insurmountable challenges or obstacles that can be overcome through faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>This teaching occurs after the disciples were unable to cast out a demon, prompting Jesus to address their lack of faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_small_faith.htm">The Power of Small Faith</a></b><br>Even a small amount of genuine faith can achieve great things.

They show conclusively that the disciples themselves came under the range of His rebuke to the "faithless and perverse generation."<p><span class= "bld">If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed.</span>--The hyperbolical form of our Lord's words, repeated afterwards in <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>, excluded from the thoughts of the disciples, as from our own, the possibility of a literal interpretation. The "grain of mustard seed" was, as in <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:">Matthew 13:31</a>, the proverbial type of the infinitely little. To "remove mountains" was, as we see in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1Corinthians 13:2</a> (this may, however, have been an echo of our Lord's teaching), the proverbial type of overcoming difficulties that seemed insurmountable. The words were, we may believe, dramatised by a gesture pointing to the mountain from which our Lord and the three disciples had descended, as afterwards by a like act in reference to the Mount of Olives (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span>--The words, absolute as they sound, are yet, <span class= "ital">ipso facto,</span> conditional. Nothing that comes within the range of faith in the wisdom and love of God, and therefore of submission to His will, is beyond the range of prayer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of your unbelief.</span> The Revised Version adopts the reading, <span class="accented">little faith</span>, in accordance with the best authorities; but it looks like a softening of the original term "unbelief," which corresponds better with Christ's own censure, "faithless generation." Jesus gives two reasons for the apostles' failure, one connected with their own moral condition, and one (ver. 21) derived from the nature of the demons exorcised. They had, indeed, shown some faith by making even the attempt at the expulsion of the devil, and were not to be classed with the unbelieving scribes; but they had acted in a half-hearted manner, and had not displayed that perfect confidence and trust which alone can win success and make all things possible. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> The Lord proceeds to give that lesson concerning perfect faith and its results, which he afterwards repeated in connection with the withered fig tree (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>, where see note) and elsewhere (<a href="/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,</span> which, as he says (<a href="/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>), "is less than all seeds." He means a faith real and trustful, though it be small and weak. The phrase is proverbial, expressive of littleness and insignificance. The mustard seed is quite little, but, grown in favourable soil and under sunny skies, it becomes, as it were, a tree among herbs, so that birds may nestle in its branches. To it faith is compared, because, small at first, it contains within itself power of large development and increase; from minute grains copious results are produced. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall say unto this mountain.</span> He points to the hill of Hermon, where the Transfiguration had taken place. <span class="cmt_word">Remove hence.</span> It is usual to consider the expression here as an Eastern hyperbole, not to be taken literally, but meaning merely that the greatest difficulties may be overcome by faith. This may be true, but it seems hardly adequate to the explanation of our Lord's emphatic words. St. Paul writes in a similar strain (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>), "If I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains;" where there is nothing necessarily hyperbolical in the supposition. It seems rather that Jesus meant his words to be received literally, implying that if such a removal as he mentioned was ever expedient and in accordance with God's will, it would be effected by the power of faith; not that he hereby sanctioned an arbitrary and wanton display of miraculous power, but he gives an assurance that, were such a measure rendered necessary for the cause of religion, it would be performable at the call of one whose whole trust was centred on God, and whose will was one with God's will. Mediaeval writers, followed by later Roman Catholic commentators, give instances of such stupendous effects of faith. The evidence of such miracles is, of course, defective, and would not satisfy modern criticism, but the existence of such legends proves that a literal view was taken of our Lord's saying. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span> The man of faith is practically omnipotent; moral and material difficulties vanish before him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
