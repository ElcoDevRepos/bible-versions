Despite witnessing His wisdom and miraculous works, they were unable to reconcile these with their familiarity with Him as a local carpenter's son. This reflects a common human tendency to undervalue what is familiar. The Greek word for "offense" here is "skandaliz&#333;," which implies a stumbling block or cause for rejection. This reaction fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>But Jesus said to them,</b><br>Jesus' response to their offense is both a rebuke and a teaching moment. His words are a direct address to the disbelief and skepticism of those who should have been most supportive. This moment is a turning point in His ministry, as it marks a shift from focusing on local ministry to a broader mission.<p><b>&#8220;Only in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores a recurring biblical theme where prophets are often rejected by their own people. Examples include Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers, and Jeremiah, who faced opposition from his own community. Jesus identifies Himself with the prophetic tradition, emphasizing His role as a prophet. This phrase also foreshadows the broader rejection He would face from the Jewish people, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him." The mention of "household" suggests that even those closest to Him, including His family, struggled to accept His divine mission, as seen earlier in <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a>.
