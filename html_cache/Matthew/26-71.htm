The gateway, often a place of transition, represents Peter's internal struggle and impending denial. In ancient times, city gates were places of judgment and decision-making, highlighting Peter's critical moment. This setting contrasts with Jesus' trial inside, emphasizing Peter's external and internal conflict.<p><b>another servant girl saw him</b><br>The mention of "another servant girl" indicates a continuation of Peter's testing. Servant girls, often overlooked in society, play pivotal roles in the narrative, showing that God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes. This encounter follows Peter's first denial, increasing the pressure on him. The repetition of a similar challenge suggests a divine orchestration of events to reveal Peter's weaknesses and the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy about Peter's denials.<p><b>and said to the people there</b><br>The servant girl's address to the bystanders amplifies the public nature of Peter's denial. In a communal society, public opinion held significant weight, and her statement could incite collective scrutiny. This moment reflects the societal dynamics of the time, where communal identity and honor were paramount. The involvement of the crowd foreshadows the collective rejection of Jesus by the people, paralleling Peter's personal denial.<p><b>&#8220;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221;</b><br>The identification of Jesus as "of Nazareth" underscores His humble origins and fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah's lowly beginnings (<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>). Nazareth, a town of little repute, highlights the contrast between Jesus' divine mission and His earthly status. The servant girl's assertion directly challenges Peter's association with Jesus, testing his loyalty. This phrase connects to earlier moments in the Gospels where Jesus' identity and origin are questioned, emphasizing the theme of recognition and rejection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later leadership in the early church.

Moving to the gateway looks like a quiet attempt to distance himself from danger, yet he remains close enough to hear what might happen to Jesus (cf. <a href="/luke/22-60.htm">Luke 22:60&#8211;61</a>).<p>&#8226; The gateway was still within the high priest&#8217;s compound; Peter&#8217;s shift in location does not remove him from temptation, reminding us that physical relocation alone cannot safeguard a wavering heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15&#8211;16</a> notes that another disciple gained Peter entry; even good connections cannot substitute for courage informed by faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another servant girl saw him</b><p>&#8226; The first accuser was a servant girl as well; this second one confirms that the threat can arise repeatedly and from unexpected places (<a href="/mark/14-69.htm">Mark 14:69</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word shows that trials often recur until a lesson is learned (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>); Peter&#8217;s repeated testing prepares him for future leadership (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant girl &#8220;saw him&#8221; underscores how visible a follower of Christ should be. Peter&#8217;s face is recognizable because he has spent time with Jesus (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>), yet his present fear mutes his witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to the people there, &#8220;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Her statement is true.

A second servant girl identifies him, and her truthful charge&#8212;&#8220;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth&#8221;&#8212;places Peter again at a crossroads. The verse exposes the insufficiency of self-confidence and the inevitability of repeated testing, while also affirming that genuine discipleship is recognizable.
