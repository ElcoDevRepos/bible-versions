This was a concession to human weakness rather than an endorsement of divorce. The cultural context of the time allowed for divorce, but it was not God's ideal. Moses' allowance was a way to manage the consequences of sin in a fallen world, ensuring some protection for women in a patriarchal society.<p><b>because of your hardness of heart</b><br>The phrase "hardness of heart" indicates a spiritual and moral stubbornness. In biblical terms, a hard heart is resistant to God's will and guidance. This condition is often associated with sin and rebellion against God. Jesus points out that the allowance for divorce was a response to human sinfulness, not a reflection of God's perfect will.<p><b>But it was not this way from the beginning</b><br>Jesus refers back to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God established marriage as a lifelong union between a man and a woman (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). This statement underscores the original divine intention for marriage, which is rooted in permanence and unity.

Jesus points past Moses to creation itself, reaffirming that God joins husband and wife in a permanent covenant. The real issue is the human heart; when hearts are softened by God&#8217;s grace, the original, lifelong marriage plan can be lived out as He intended.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Moses because of the hardness of your hearts.</span>--The force of the answer lies (1) in emphasized substitution of "suffered" for "commanded." The scribes of the school of Hillel had almost turned divorce into a duty, even when there was no ground for it but incompatibility of temper or other lesser fault, as if <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a> had enjoined the writing of divorcement in such cases. (2) In the grounds assigned for the permission. Our Lord's position in the controversy between the two schools was analogous to that in which those who are true at once to principles and facts not seldom find themselves. He agreed, as we have seen, with the ideal of marriage maintained by the followers of Shammai. He accepted as a legitimate interpretation of the Law that of the followers of Hillel. But He proclaimed, with an authority greater than that of Moses, that his legislation on this point was a step backwards when compared with the primary law of nature, which had been "from the beginning," and only so far a step forward because the people had fallen into a yet lower state, in which the observance of the higher law was practically impossible. But for the possibility of divorce the wife would have been the victim of the husband's tyranny; and law, which has to deal with facts, was compelled to choose the least of two evils. Two important consequences, it will be obvious, flow from the reasoning thus enforced: (1) that the "hardness of heart" which made this concession necessary may be admitted as at least a partial explanation of whatever else in the Law of Moses strikes us as deviating from the standard of eternal righteousness embodied in the law of Christ--as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the tolerance of polygamy and slavery, and the severity of punishment for seeming trivial faults; (2) that the principle is one of wider application than the particular instance, and that where a nation calling itself Christian has sunk so low as to exhibit the "hardness of heart" of Jews or heathens, there also a concessive legislation may be forced upon the State even while the churches assert their witness of the higher truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses because of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">with a view to</span>, to meet) <span class="cmt_word">the hardness of your hearts;</span> your obstinacy, perverseness. You were not honest and pure enough to obey the primitive law. There was danger that you would ill treat your wives in order to get rid of them, or even murder them. The lesser evil was regular divorce. But the enactment is really a shame and reproach to you, and was occasioned by grave defects in your character and conduct. And it is not true to say that Moses <span class="accented">commanded</span>; he only <span class="cmt_word">suffered you to put away your wives.</span> This was a temporary permission to meet your then circumstances. Divorce had been practised commonly and long; it was traditional; it was seen among all other Oriental peoples. Moses could not hope at once to eradicate the inveterate evil; he could only modify, mitigate, and regulate its practice. The rules which he introduced were intended, not to facilitate divorce, but to lead men better to realize the proper idea of marriage. And Christ was introducing a better law, a higher morality, for which Mosaic legislation paved the way (comp. <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning.</span> The original institution of marriage contained no idea of divorce; it was no mere civil contract, made by man and dissoluble by man, but a union of God's own formation, with which no human power could interfere. However novel this view might seem, it was God's own design from the first. The first instance of polygamy occurs in <a href="/genesis/4-19.htm">Genesis 4:19</a>, and is connected with murder and revenge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;[It was] because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
