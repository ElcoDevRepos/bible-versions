Jesus often used everyday situations and objects to convey deeper spiritual truths. By inviting a child, He sets the stage for a lesson on humility and greatness in the kingdom of heaven. This invitation is a call to attention, emphasizing the importance of what He is about to teach.<p><b>a little child</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, children were considered low in social status and without power or influence. By choosing a child, Jesus challenges the disciples' understanding of greatness and status. The child represents innocence, dependence, and humility, qualities that are essential for those who wish to enter the kingdom of heaven. This act also foreshadows the value Jesus places on the "least of these" throughout His ministry.<p><b>to stand among them</b><br>The act of placing the child among the disciples is symbolic. It visually represents the centrality of humility and childlike faith in the community of believers. This positioning among the disciples serves as a direct contrast to their previous discussions about who would be the greatest in the kingdom. It underscores the message that true greatness is found in humility and service, not in status or power. This moment is a practical demonstration of Jesus' teaching that the last shall be first, and the first shall be last (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching His disciples about the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_child.htm">Little Child</a></b><br>Represents innocence, humility, and dependence, which Jesus uses as an example for His disciples.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being taught about the values of the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/setting.htm">Setting</a></b><br>This event takes place during Jesus' ministry, likely in a house in Capernaum, where He often taught His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/childlike_humility.htm">Childlike Humility</a></b><br>Jesus uses a child to illustrate the humility required to enter the kingdom of heaven.

By initiating the moment, selecting a powerless example, and giving that child a place among grown men, Jesus redefines greatness as humble dependence on Him. The verse calls believers to welcome, value, and imitate such childlike trust within the community of faith, knowing that this posture aligns with the very heart of Christ&#8217;s kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Jesus called a little child unto him.</span>--As the conversation was "in the house" (<a href="/mark/9-33.htm" title="And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way?">Mark 9:33</a>), and that house probably was Peter's, the child may have been one of his.

St. Mark adds that He folded His arms round the child as in loving fondness, and, before He did so, uttered the warning words, "If any one will (wishes to) be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all." A late tradition of the Eastern Church identified the child with Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, taking the name which he gave himself as passive, <span class= "greekheb">????????</span> (Theo-phoros), "one who had been carried or borne by God." Ignatius himself, however, uses it in its active sense, "one who carries God within him."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A little child.</span> Our Lord teaches, not only by spoken parables, but by symbolical actions also.
