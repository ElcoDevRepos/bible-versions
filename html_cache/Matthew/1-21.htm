The birth of a son signifies the continuation of the Davidic line, as Jesus is a descendant of King David, fulfilling the covenant promise made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. The birth of a son also highlights the humanity of Jesus, emphasizing His role as the incarnate Word (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and you are to give Him the name Jesus</b><br>The name "Jesus" is the Greek form of the Hebrew name "Yeshua" or "Joshua," meaning "The Lord is salvation" or "Yahweh saves." This name was divinely appointed, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>, where the angel Gabriel instructs Mary to name her child Jesus. The name signifies His mission to bring salvation to humanity, aligning with the Old Testament theme of God as the deliverer of His people (<a href="/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>).<p><b>because He will save His people from their sins.</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the primary mission of Jesus: salvation from sin. It reflects the messianic expectation of a savior who would deliver Israel, but it expands this role to a spiritual deliverance from sin, not just political or national liberation. This salvation is prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who bears the iniquities of many. The concept of salvation from sin is central to the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where Jesus' sacrificial death is portrayed as the means by which humanity is reconciled to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, a young Jewish woman chosen by God to bear the Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The earthly father of Jesus, a righteous man who obeyed God's command to name the child Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose name means "The Lord saves" or "Yahweh is salvation."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>The messenger who appeared to Joseph in a dream to deliver God's instructions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people to whom Jesus was first sent, representing God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_name_jesus.htm">The Significance of the Name Jesus</a></b><br>The name "Jesus" is derived from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," meaning "The Lord saves."

The customs of the Jews were, as we have seen, against any communications between the bride and bridegroom during the period of betrothal, and the facts of the case (including Mary's visit to Elizabeth) would make it more improbable than ever.<p>The name Jesus was one full of meaning, but it was not as yet a specially sacred name.

It had not been directly associated, however, with Messianic hopes, and the intimation that it was to be the name of the Christ gave a new character to men's thoughts of the kingdom. Not conquest, but "salvation"--deliverance, not from human enemies only or chiefly, nor from the penalties of sin, but from the sins themselves. As spoken by the angel to the dreamer it was the answer to prayers and hopes, going beyond the hope, and purifying it from earthly thoughts.
