It is significant in the New Testament as the site of many of Jesus' teachings and miracles. The area was a hub of fishing and trade, making it a strategic location for Jesus to begin His ministry. The Sea of Galilee is surrounded by hills, providing a natural amphitheater for Jesus' teachings. This setting emphasizes Jesus' connection to everyday life and His accessibility to the common people.<p><b>He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew</b><br>Simon, later named Peter by Jesus, is a central figure in the Gospels and the early church. His name means "rock," signifying his foundational role in the church. Andrew, Peter's brother, is known for bringing people to Jesus, including Peter himself. The calling of these brothers highlights the importance of family and relational evangelism in the spread of the Gospel. Their partnership in fishing foreshadows their future collaboration in ministry.<p><b>They were casting a net into the sea</b><br>Fishing was a common occupation in Galilee, and casting nets was a typical method used by fishermen. This imagery of casting nets is later used by Jesus to describe the work of evangelism, as seen in His call to make them "fishers of men." The act of casting a net symbolizes the spreading of the Gospel message and the gathering of people into the Kingdom of God. It also reflects the hard work and perseverance required in ministry.<p><b>for they were fishermen</b><br>Fishermen in the first century were known for their hard work, patience, and resilience. These qualities would be essential for the disciples as they faced challenges in their mission. The choice of fishermen as Jesus' first disciples underscores the theme of God using ordinary people for extraordinary purposes. It also reflects the humility and simplicity of Jesus' ministry, contrasting with the religious elite of the time. The calling of fishermen fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah reaching out to the humble and lowly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who begins His ministry by calling His first disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of the first disciples called by Jesus, later becomes a leading apostle and a foundational figure in the early Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/andrew.htm">Andrew</a></b><br>Simon Peter's brother, also called to be a disciple.

Here, everything seems sudden and abrupt. There we learn that those who were now called had some months before accepted Him as the Christ (<a href="/context/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35-43</a>), and had, some or all of them, been with Him during His visit to Jerusalem. Simon had already received the surname of Cephas or Peter or the Rock. Putting these facts together, we have something like a clear outline picture of their previous life. The sons of Jona and the sons of Zebedee had grown up in Bethsaida (probably on the north-west shore of the Lake of Galilee), and were partners in their work as fishermen. The movement of Judas of Galilee, in his assertion of national independence, had probably served to quicken their expectations of a good time coming, when they should be free from their oppressors. When they heard of the preaching of the Baptist, they joined the crowds that flocked to hear him, and received his baptism of repentance. Then they were pointed to the Lamb of God, and received Him as the Christ. Then for a short time they were His companions in His journeyings. When He began the first circuit of His Galilean ministry He was alone, and left them to return to their old calling. They could not tell whether He would ever care to use their services again, and it was under these circumstances that the new call came. St. Matthew's narrative and St. Mark's (<a href="/context/mark/1-16.htm" title="Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Mark 1:16-20</a>) agree almost verbally; St. Luke's presents more difficulty. Is it another and fuller version of the same facts? or, if different, did what he records precede or follow the call which they relate? The first view seems the most probable, but see Notes on <a href="/context/luke/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,">Luke 5:1-11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-22.</span> - The <span class="accented">summons to help in his work: his first formal adherents.</span> (Parallel passage: <a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16-20</a> <a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1, 2, 9-11</a>, very doubtful, but cf.
