In biblical times, clothing was a significant part of one's identity and social status. The act of clothing the naked is a tangible expression of compassion and mercy, aligning with the teachings found in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>, which calls for sharing with the needy. This act of kindness is seen as serving Christ Himself, as He identifies with the least of these. The imagery of clothing also connects to the spiritual concept of being clothed in righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>.<p><b>I was sick and you looked after Me</b><br>Caring for the sick is a demonstration of mercy and compassion, reflecting the healing ministry of Jesus. In the historical context, illness often led to social isolation, as seen in the treatment of lepers. By looking after the sick, believers are called to emulate Christ's example, who healed many during His earthly ministry (<a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16-17</a>). This phrase underscores the call to serve others selflessly, as seen in <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a>, where the church is encouraged to pray for and anoint the sick. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God as the ultimate healer.<p><b>I was in prison and you visited Me</b><br>Visiting those in prison was a radical act of compassion in the ancient world, where prisoners were often neglected and reliant on outsiders for basic needs. This phrase emphasizes the call to remember those who are marginalized and forgotten, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-3.htm">Hebrews 13:3</a>, which urges believers to remember those in prison as if they were bound with them. The act of visiting prisoners reflects the heart of the gospel, which brings hope and redemption to the captive. It also mirrors the mission of Jesus, who proclaimed freedom for the prisoners (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>), and serves as a reminder of the spiritual liberation offered through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching about the final judgment and the importance of serving others as a reflection of serving Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep_and_the_goats.htm">The Sheep and the Goats</a></b><br>In the broader context of <a href="/bsb/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>, Jesus uses the parable of the sheep and the goats to illustrate the separation of the righteous from the unrighteous at the final judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being instructed on how to live out their faith in practical ways.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_needy.htm">The Needy</a></b><br>Represented by those who are naked, sick, or in prison, these individuals symbolize the marginalized and vulnerable in society whom Jesus calls His followers to serve.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The ultimate place of reward for those who have lived out their faith through acts of compassion and service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>True Christian faith is demonstrated through acts of compassion and service to others.

When we dress the destitute, Jesus counts it as clothing Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was sick and you looked after Me</b><p>&#8226; The Lord speaks of hands-on care: visiting, feeding, cleaning, comforting.

Such acts do not earn salvation, but they unmistakably reveal a heart transformed by His grace and committed to loving others as He first loved us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Ye visited me.</span>--The Greek word is somewhat stronger than the modern meaning of the English, and includes "looking after," "caring for." The verb is formed from the same root as <span class= "ital">Episcopos,</span> the bishop, or overseer of the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye visited me.</span> The visitation of the sick has become a common term among us. It implies properly going to see, though other ideas are connoted. <span class="cmt_word">Ye came unto me.</span> It was easier in those days to visit friends in prison than it is at the present time. Good men, if they could not obtain release of prisoners, might comfort and sympathize with them. The seven corporal works of mercy which antiquity has endorsed have been preserved in the mnemonic line, "Visito, poto, cibo, redimo, tego, colligo, condo. All these might be performed by non-Christians who professed the fear of God and followed the guidance of conscience. God never leaves himself without witness; his Spirit strives with man, and in the absence of higher and completer revelation, to be wholly guided by these inner motions is to work out salvation, as far as circumstances allow, and in a certain restricted sense. In a universal judgment regard is had to this consideration. "In return for what do they receive such things? For the covering of a roof, for a garment, for bread, for cold water, for visiting, for going into the prison. For indeed in every case it is for what is needed; and sometimes not even for that. For surely the sick and he that is in bonds seek not for this only, but the one to be loosed, the other to be delivered from his infirmity. But he, being gracious, requires only what is within our power, or rather even less than what is within our power, leaving to us to exert our generosity in doing more" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[I was] naked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gymnos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1131.htm">Strong's 1131: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rarely: stark-naked; generally: wearing only the under-garment; bare, open, manifest; mere.
