The crowds, likely composed of pilgrims coming to Jerusalem for Passover, recognize Jesus as a significant figure. The act of going ahead and following Him signifies a procession, a common practice for honoring royalty or a victorious leader. This public acclamation fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, where the King comes to Jerusalem riding on a donkey, symbolizing peace rather than war.<p><b>&#8220;Hosanna to the Son of David!&#8221;</b><br>"Hosanna" is a Hebrew expression meaning "save now" or "save, we pray." It is both a plea for salvation and an exclamation of praise. The title "Son of David" acknowledges Jesus as the promised Messiah, a descendant of King David, fulfilling the covenant God made with David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. This title is significant as it connects Jesus to the messianic prophecies and expectations of the Jewish people, who anticipated a deliverer from David's line.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>, a messianic psalm often recited during Passover. It was traditionally used to greet pilgrims entering Jerusalem, but here it takes on a deeper meaning as the crowd acknowledges Jesus as the one sent by God. The phrase signifies divine approval and mission, indicating that Jesus comes with God's authority and blessing. This acknowledgment aligns with the Jewish expectation of a divinely appointed leader who would restore Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Hosanna in the highest!&#8221;</b><br>This expression elevates the plea for salvation to the highest heavens, suggesting that the salvation Jesus brings is not just earthly but has heavenly significance. It implies that the praise and recognition of Jesus' messianic role extend beyond the earthly realm to the heavenly hosts. This phrase echoes the angelic announcement at Jesus' birth in <a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>, where peace and glory are proclaimed in the highest heavens, further affirming Jesus' divine mission and identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, entering Jerusalem as the prophesied Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The people who gathered around Jesus, both leading and following Him, expressing their recognition of His messianic role.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_david.htm">Son of David</a></b><br>A messianic title acknowledging Jesus' royal lineage and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosanna.htm">Hosanna</a></b><br>A Hebrew expression meaning "save now," used here as a cry of praise and recognition of Jesus' divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_jesus_as_messiah.htm">Recognition of Jesus as Messiah</a></b><br>The crowds' acclamation of Jesus as the "Son of David" and their use of "Hosanna" reflect a recognition of His messianic identity.

(1.) As here, "Hosanna." The word was a Hebrew imperative, "Save us, we beseech thee," and had come into liturgical use from Psalms 118. That Psalm belonged specially to the Feast of Tabernacles (see Perowne on Psalms 118), and as such, was naturally associated with the palm-branches; the verses from it now chanted by the people are said to have been those with which the inhabitants of Jerusalem were wont to welcome the pilgrims who came up to keep the feast. The addition of "Hosanna to the Son of David" made it a direct recognition of the claims of Jesus to be the Christ; that of "Hosanna in the highest" (comp. <a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>) claimed heaven as in accord with earth in this recognition. (2.) "Blessed be" ("the King" in St. Luke) "He that cometh in the name of the Lord." These words, too, received a special personal application. The welcome was now given, not to the crowd of pilgrims, but to the King. (3.) As in St. Luke, one of the cries was an echo of the angels' hymn at the Nativity, "Peace on earth, and glory in the highest" (<a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>). (4.) As in St. Mark, "Blessed be the kingdom of our father David." We have to think of these shouts as filling the air as He rides slowly on in silence. He will not check them at the bidding of the Pharisees (<a href="/luke/19-39.htm" title="And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke your disciples.">Luke 19:39</a>), but His own spirit is filled with quite other thoughts than theirs. And those who watched Him saw the tears streaming down His cheeks as He looked on the walls and towers of the city, and heard, what the crowds manifestly did not hear, His lamentation over its coming fall (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The multitudes that went before, and that followed</span>. These expressions point to two separate bodies, which combined in escorting Jesus at a certain portion of the route. We learn from St. John (<a href="/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18</a>) that much people, greatly excited by the news of the raising of Lazarus, when they heard that he was in the neighbourhood, hurried forth from Jerusalem to meet and do him honour. These, when they met the other procession with Jesus riding in the midst, turned back again and preceded him into the city. St. Luke identifies the spot as "at the descent of the Mount of Olives." "As they approached the shoulder of the hill," says Dr. Geikie ('The Life of Christ,' 2:397), "where the road bends downwards to the north, the sparse vegetation of the eastern slope changed, as in a moment, to the rich green of garden and trees, and Jerusalem in its glory rose before them. It is hard for us to imagine now the splendour of the view. The city of God, seated on her hills, shone at the moment in the morning sun. Straight before stretched the vast white walls and buildings of the temple, its courts glittering with gold, rising one above the other; the steep sides of the hill of David crowned with lofty walls; the mighty castles towering above them; the sumptuous palace of Herod in its green parks; and the picturesque outlines of the streets." <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna to the Son of David!</span> "Hosanna!" is compounded of two words meaning "save" and "now," or, "I pray," and is written in full <span class="accented">Hoshia-na</span>, translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>. The expressions uttered by the people are mostly derived from <a href="/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, which formed part of the great Hallel (<a href="/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>.) sung at the Feast of Tabernacles. "Hosanna!" was originally a formula of prayer and supplication, but later became a term of joy and congratulation. So here the cry signifies "Blessings on [or, 'Jehovah bless'] the Son of David!" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Messiah, acknowledging Jesus to be he, the promised Prince of David's line. Thus we say, "God save the king!" This, which Ewald calls the first Christian hymn, gave to Palm Sunday, in some parts of the Church, the name of the "day of Hosannas," and was incorporated into the liturgical service both in East and West. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed... of the Lord:</span> (<a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>). The formula is taken in two ways, the words, "ill the Name of the Lord," being connected either with "blessed" or with "cometh." In the former case the cry signifies, "The blessing of Jehovah rest on him who cometh!" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, Messiah (<a href="/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); in the latter, the meaning is, "Blessing on him who cometh with Divine mission, sent with the authority of Jehovah!" The second interpretation seems to be correct. <span class="cmt_word">In the highest</span> (comp. <a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). The people cry to God to ratify in heaven the blessing which they invoke on earth. This homage and the title of Messiah Jesus now accepts as his due, openly asserting his claims, and by his acquiescence encouraging the excitement. St. Matthew omits the touching scene of Christ's lamentations over Jerusalem, as he passed the spot where Roman legions would, a generation hence, encamp against the doomed city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
