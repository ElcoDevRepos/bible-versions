This moment occurs after James and John's mother asked Jesus for her sons to sit at His right and left in His kingdom. The request highlights the human tendency towards ambition and status, which was a common cultural value in the Greco-Roman world. The disciples' reaction indicates that they were closely following the conversation and were aware of the implications of such a request.<p><b>they were indignant</b><br>The word "indignant" suggests a strong emotional response, likely a mix of anger and jealousy. This reaction is consistent with human nature and reflects the disciples' misunderstanding of Jesus' teachings on servanthood and humility. Their indignation reveals their own desires for prominence and power, which Jesus frequently addressed throughout His ministry. This moment serves as a teaching opportunity for Jesus to further explain the nature of His kingdom, contrasting earthly power with spiritual leadership.<p><b>with the two brothers.</b><br>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, are the "two brothers" who were part of Jesus' inner circle. Their request, made through their mother, reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom. In Jewish culture, family ties were significant, and it was not uncommon for family members to advocate for one another. This incident highlights the ongoing theme in the Gospels of the disciples' struggle to grasp the concept of servant leadership, which Jesus exemplified. The brothers' ambition is juxtaposed with Jesus' call to humility and service, as He later explains that true greatness in His kingdom is measured by one's willingness to serve others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_disciples.htm">The Ten Disciples</a></b><br>These are the remaining disciples of Jesus who were not involved in the request made by James and John.

The request happened privately, but word reached the rest of the disciples.<p>&#8226; The ten had walked the same dusty roads, witnessed the same miracles, and believed they were on equal footing with the two brothers. Hearing about this special request sounded like an attempt to leapfrog over them, upsetting their sense of unity (<a href="/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35-41</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment exposes the disciples&#8217; lingering focus on earthly rank. Only a short time earlier Jesus had taught that greatness in His kingdom comes through humility like that of a child (<a href="/matthew/18-1.htm">Matthew 18:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their hearing sets up an opportunity for Jesus to teach again that ambition for personal glory is out of step with His call to servanthood (<a href="/luke/22-24.htm">Luke 22:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were indignant</b><p>Indignation is strong displeasure mixed with offense. The ten felt wronged and probably jealous.<p>&#8226; Similar indignation erupts whenever self-interest collides with another&#8217;s advantage (<a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>; <a href="/acts/7-9.htm">Acts 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their anger was not righteous; it sprang from wounded pride. While anger against sin is appropriate (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>), anger triggered by threatened status reveals a heart still learning Christlike humility.<p>&#8226; Jesus immediately addressed their indignation by contrasting worldly leadership that &#8220;lords it over&#8221; with kingdom leadership that serves (<a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-27</a>). In doing so, He redirected their emotions toward self-examination and service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the two brothers</b><p>The focus of their indignation was James and John, sons of Zebedee.<p>&#8226; These brothers, part of Jesus&#8217; inner circle, already enjoyed closeness with Him (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37</a>). Seeking even higher honor seemed greedy in their peers&#8217; eyes.<p>&#8226; James and John illustrate how genuine followers can still harbor mixed motives. Even after confessing Jesus as Messiah (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>), they underestimated His path of suffering and overestimated their place in future glory.<p>&#8226; Jesus did not reject them; instead, He guided them. James would later be the first apostle martyred (<a href="/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1-2</a>), and John would faithfully shepherd the church into old age (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>). Their lives prove that Christ can transform selfish ambition into sacrificial service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/20-24.htm">Matthew 20:24</a> reveals that the other disciples reacted with offended anger when they heard James and John&#8217;s bid for prominence. Their indignation exposes human pride but also sets the stage for Jesus to teach servant leadership. The verse reminds believers that rivalry and jealousy fracture fellowship, while humility and service align us with the King who &#8220;did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Against the two brethren.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">concerning,</span> or <span class= "ital">about.</span> The context shows that it was not a righteous indignation, as against that which was unworthy of true followers of Jesus, but rather the jealousy of rivals, angry that the two brothers should have taken what seemed an unfair advantage of our Lord's known affection for them and for their mother.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Were moved with indignation against</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">concerning</span>. "The ambition of one creates envy in others who partake of the same feeling" (I. Williams). The displeasure of the ten arose from their sharing in the ambitious desires which had prompted the request of the brothers.
