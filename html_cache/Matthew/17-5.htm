Where the Hebrew text had had "I will dwell in thee," the Targum of Jonathan had "I will make my Shechinah to dwell" (<a href="/zechariah/2-10.htm" title="Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, see, I come, and I will dwell in the middle of you, said the LORD.">Zechariah 2:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.">Zechariah 8:3</a>). Its appearance at this moment, followed by the voice out or the cloud, was a witness that no tabernacle made with hands was now needed, that the humanity of Christ was the true tabernacle of God (comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), and that it was in this sense true that "the tabernacle of God was with men" (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>), and that He would dwell with them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A bright cloud overshadowed them.</span> The cloud spread over and around, not Jesus only and the other two, but in some degree over the apostles also, as St. Luke adds, "They feared as they entered into the cloud." It was the Shechinah, the token of the presence of the Most High, who dwelleth in the unapproachable light. It enshrouded Jesus and his two companions, so that mortal eye could not pierce it or even look upon it; but the apostles, who were outside its immediate contact, were in some sort included in its influence, so that it could be said to overshadow them. St. Peter calls it "the excellent glory (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>). The cloud from which on Sinai the old Law was given, was dark and threatening (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>); this was bright, coming not to terrify, but to teach and to bless. Here is seen the contrast between the two dispensations, the Law and the gospel (comp. <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A voice out of the cloud.</span> It was the voice of God the Father, for he called Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">My beloved Son.</span> The same voice, saying the same words, had been heard over the waters of Jordan when Jesus was baptized (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>); it spake once again just before his Passion (<a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a>); at all times witnessing the Father's love and the perfect Divinity of Christ. Now, as before, the Holy Trinity was revealed, the Father speaking with audible voice, the Son standing in radiant light, the Holy Spirit present with the intense brightness of the enveloping cloud. The words heard are fontal in the earlier Scriptures. Thus in <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> we read, "Behold my Servant, whom I uphold, my Chosen in whom my soul delighteth;" and in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye him.</span> Not Moses and Elias, but Jesus, the Mediator of a better covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). "This voice," St. Peter testifies, "we ourselves heard come out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount" (<a href="/2_peter/1-18.htm">2 Peter 1:18</a>). As Edersheim remarks, even if this Epistle is not St. Peter's, it still would represent the most ancient tradition. "God, having of old spoken unto the fathers in the prophets, hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son" (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The command to hear him recalls the saying of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>), that in good time God would raise up from Israel a Prophet like unto himself, and that unto him they shall hearken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Eti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2089.htm">Strong's 2089: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) of time: still, yet, even now, (b) of degree: even, further, more, in addition.
