Despite the urgency of His mission, He stops for two blind men who are calling out to Him. This demonstrates Jesus' compassion and willingness to address the needs of individuals, even when He is focused on a larger mission. The act of stopping signifies the importance Jesus places on personal interaction and care. This moment reflects the nature of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, who knows His sheep and responds to their cries (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>). The calling of the blind men also echoes the call of God to humanity, inviting them into a relationship with Him.<p><b>&#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' question is not due to a lack of knowledge, as He is omniscient, but rather serves to engage the blind men in expressing their faith and desire. This question invites them to articulate their need, demonstrating their faith in His ability to heal. It is reminiscent of God's invitation to Solomon to ask for whatever he wanted (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>), highlighting the importance of asking in faith. This interaction underscores the biblical principle of asking and receiving, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, where Jesus teaches about the importance of prayer and seeking God's help. The question also serves to focus the men's faith specifically on Jesus as the source of their healing, reinforcing the personal nature of their encounter with Him.<p><b>He asked.</b><br>The act of asking indicates Jesus' desire for a personal relationship and interaction with those He encounters. It reflects the relational aspect of God's nature, as seen throughout Scripture, where God engages with individuals in a personal and direct manner. This moment is a demonstration of Jesus' humility and approachability, qualities that are central to His ministry. By asking, Jesus also models the importance of communication and dialogue in relationships, both with God and with others. This approach is consistent with the biblical theme of God seeking a personal relationship with humanity, as seen in the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>) and throughout the narrative of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the compassionate healer and teacher who stops to address the needs of those calling out to Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_men.htm">The Blind Men</a></b><br>Two blind men sitting by the roadside who call out to Jesus for mercy, demonstrating faith and persistence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people accompanying Jesus, who initially rebuke the blind men, but later witness Jesus' compassion and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The city near which this event takes place, a significant location in biblical history, often associated with miraculous events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roadside.htm">The Roadside</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, symbolizing the marginalization of the blind men and their desperate situation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_of_christ.htm">Compassion of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to stop and address the needs of the marginalized teaches us about His compassionate nature.

St. Mark gives, with a graphic fulness, the very words of the message, "Be of good cheer, arise; He calleth thee," and adds that the blind man flung off his outer cloak, or mantle, and leapt up and came to Jesus. All three Gospels give our Lord's question in the same, or nearly the same, words. He sought, as with the clear insight of sympathy, to know what was the special grief that weighed upon the man's spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus stood still</span>. He acknowledged the title of "Son of David," and, as the blind men could not follow him, he stopped his progress; their perseverance won his acceptance; he was ready to listen to their appeal and to grant their request. <span class="cmt_word">Called them.</span> The gracious summons left them in no doubt as to the happy issue of their prayer. St. Mark speaks of the joyful alacrity with which the blind man obeyed the call; how he "cast away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">What will ye that I shall do unto you?</span> The Lord knew the desire of their hearts, but he wished to draw forth the public confession of their needs, and the distinct blessing which they craved, that all the bystanders might acknowledge the miracle, and the sufferers themselves might be incited more vehemently to urge their plea, and thus become more worthy of relief. So God knows all our necessities before we ask, but he will have our prayers, that we may cooperate with him in the work which he purposes to accomplish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stopped</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(stas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2476.htm">Strong's 2476: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary stao stah'-o; to stand, used in various applications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#966;&#974;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eph&#333;n&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5455.htm">Strong's 5455: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phone; to emit a sound; by implication, to address in words or by name, also in imitation.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
