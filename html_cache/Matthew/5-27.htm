The phrase "You have heard" suggests an oral tradition or teaching that was prevalent among the Jewish people. It reflects the rabbinic method of teaching where the Law was often quoted and discussed. Jesus is referencing the traditional understanding of the Mosaic Law, which was taught by the scribes and Pharisees. This sets the stage for Jesus to provide a deeper, more spiritual interpretation of the Law.<p><b>&#8216;Do not commit adultery.&#8217;</b><br>This commandment is the seventh of the Ten Commandments found in <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/5-18.htm">Deuteronomy 5:18</a>. Adultery, in the biblical context, refers to a married person engaging in sexual relations with someone other than their spouse. In ancient Israel, adultery was considered a serious offense, not only against the spouse but also against God, as it violated the covenantal relationship. The prohibition against adultery was intended to protect the sanctity of marriage and the family unit, which were foundational to the social and religious life of Israel. In the broader biblical narrative, adultery is often used metaphorically to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God, as seen in the prophetic books like Hosea. Jesus, in this passage, is about to expand the understanding of this commandment beyond the physical act to include the intentions and desires of the heart, emphasizing the internalization of God's Law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>Primarily Jewish followers and disciples who were familiar with the Mosaic Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant teaching event where Jesus expounds on the Law and introduces deeper spiritual principles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mosaic_law.htm">Mosaic Law</a></b><br>The original context of the commandment against adultery, found in the Ten Commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_beatitudes.htm">Mount of Beatitudes</a></b><br>The traditional location where the Sermon on the Mount was delivered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_law's_intent.htm">Understanding the Law's Intent</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that the Law is not just about external actions but also about internal purity.
