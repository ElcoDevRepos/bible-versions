The feeding of the five thousand is one of the few miracles recorded in all four Gospels (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>, <a href="/mark/6-30.htm">Mark 6:30-44</a>, <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>, <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>), underscoring its significance. The number "five thousand" refers specifically to men, which was a common way of counting in ancient times, often excluding women and children. This miracle demonstrates Jesus' compassion and divine provision, echoing the Old Testament provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also prefigures the Last Supper and the Eucharist, where Jesus provides spiritual nourishment.<p><b>besides women and children</b><br>This addition indicates that the total number of people fed was significantly higher than five thousand, possibly reaching ten to fifteen thousand or more. The inclusion of women and children highlights the comprehensive nature of Jesus' ministry, which reached all demographics. In the cultural context of the time, women and children were often not counted in official records, yet Jesus' ministry consistently elevated their status and included them in His miracles and teachings. This phrase also emphasizes the abundance of Jesus' provision, as He not only met the needs of the counted men but also the entire crowd present.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this event, performing the miracle of feeding the multitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who distributed the food to the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Comprising about five thousand men, plus women and children, who were fed by Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_location.htm">The Location</a></b><br>A remote place where Jesus had withdrawn, likely near the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_multiplication.htm">The Miracle of Multiplication</a></b><br>The event where Jesus multiplied five loaves and two fish to feed the large crowd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundant_provision.htm">God's Abundant Provision</a></b><br>Jesus' miracle demonstrates God's ability to provide abundantly beyond our needs.

This sets the stage for the miracle just completed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Counting the Men</b><p>&#8226; Matthew specifies &#8220;about five thousand men.&#8221; The number is literal, underscoring the historical reliability of the event (cf. <a href="/mark/6-44.htm">Mark 6:44</a>, <a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; In first-century Jewish culture, public gatherings often counted males separately, especially for logistical reasons such as seating and food distribution.<p>&#8226; Five thousand adult males alone would fill several modern sports arenas; it amplifies how vast the miracle really was.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Besides Women and Children</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;besides women and children&#8221; widens the scope.<p>&#8226; If each man was accompanied by even one family member, the total easily exceeded ten thousand. Many scholars suggest fifteen-to-twenty thousand people (cf. <a href="/luke/9-14.htm">Luke 9:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Matthew&#8217;s wording emphasizes that Jesus&#8217; provision far surpassed the primary count, illustrating divine abundance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Miraculous Provision</b><p>&#8226; Jesus multiplied five loaves and two fish (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-20</a>).

Organization partnered with divine power.<p>&#8226; He blessed, broke, and gave&#8212;an order echoed later at the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples distributed what they received, showing ministry flows from what Christ provides, not personal resources.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Faith-Building for Future Ministry</b><p>&#8226; Soon after this event, Jesus walked on water (<a href="/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-33</a>). The feeding prepared the disciples to trust Him in the storm.<p>&#8226; Remembering God&#8217;s past provision fuels present faith; Israel was often called to recall the Exodus and manna (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>). Believers today likewise rehearse God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Personal Application</b><p>&#8226; No need or crowd is too large for Jesus. Financial strain, family crises, or ministry challenges fall within His capacity.<p>&#8226; Offer what you have&#8212;however small&#8212;and place it in His hands. He delights to multiply humble offerings.<p>&#8226; Expect leftovers. God&#8217;s generosity typically exceeds the immediate requirement (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a> records a literal headcount that magnifies Jesus&#8217; miraculous provision: five thousand men plus untold women and children fully satisfied by five loaves and two fish. The detail authenticates the event, highlights divine abundance, teaches dependence on Christ, and assures believers that the Lord who met the crowd&#8217;s physical hunger still meets every need today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Beside women and children.</span>--St. Matthew is the only Evangelist who mentions their presence, but all the four use the word which emphasises the fact that all the five thousand were <span class= "ital">men.</span> As the crowd had come in many cases from considerable distances, the women and children were probably few in number, were grouped together by themselves, and were not counted, so that the round number dwelt in men's minds without reference to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that</span> <span class="cmt_word">had eaten</span> were <span class="cmt_word">about five thousand men, beside women and children</span>.
