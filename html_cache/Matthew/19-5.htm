It highlights the authority of the Old Testament in Jesus' teachings. By using "and said," Jesus affirms the divine inspiration of the Genesis account, emphasizing that these are not merely human words but God's design for marriage.<p><b>&#8216;For this reason</b><br>This phrase points to the purpose and intent behind the creation of marriage. It suggests a divine rationale, indicating that marriage is not a human invention but a part of God's original plan for humanity. The "reason" refers to the preceding context in Genesis, where God creates woman as a suitable helper for man, establishing the foundation for the marital relationship.<p><b>a man will leave his father and mother</b><br>This indicates a significant cultural shift from the traditional family structure. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, family ties were strong, and living with extended family was common. The act of leaving one's parents signifies the establishment of a new, primary family unit. It underscores the priority and independence of the marital relationship over the parental one.<p><b>and be united to his wife,</b><br>The phrase "be united" implies a deep, covenantal bond. The Hebrew word used in Genesis, "dabaq," suggests a strong, enduring attachment. This union is not merely physical but involves emotional and spiritual dimensions. It reflects the covenant relationship God desires with His people, as seen in other biblical covenants.<p><b>and the two will become one flesh&#8217;?</b><br>This phrase describes the profound unity achieved in marriage. It encompasses physical, emotional, and spiritual oneness. The concept of "one flesh" is foundational to understanding the biblical view of marriage as a sacred, indivisible union. It also prefigures the unity between Christ and the Church, as elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>, where Paul uses this imagery to describe the relationship between Christ and believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees who questioned Him about the lawfulness of divorce.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Israel known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

The Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch insert "the two," which is not in the present Hebrew text. Our Lord adopts the addition as conveying the correct sense. In marriage there is a moral and physical union, so that two persons become virtually one being. Originally, man contained woman in himself before she was separated from him; she was a corporeal unity with man; or, as others put it, man, as a race, was created male and female, the latter being implicitly contained in the former; the previous unity is thus asserted. In marriage this unity is acknowledged and continued. St. Paul quotes this text in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31</a>; and in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16</a> uses it as an argument against fornication, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
