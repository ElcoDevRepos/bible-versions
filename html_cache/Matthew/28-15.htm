This act of bribery highlights the lengths to which the religious leaders went to suppress the truth of the resurrection. In the cultural context, Roman soldiers were expected to maintain strict discipline and honesty, making this act of taking a bribe particularly significant. The use of money as a tool for deception is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).<p><b>and did as they were instructed.</b><br>The guards followed the instructions given by the chief priests, indicating the influence and authority the religious leaders held. This obedience to corrupt orders reflects the moral and ethical challenges faced by individuals in positions of power. The guards' compliance also underscores the tension between truth and falsehood, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. This act of following deceitful instructions contrasts with the call for believers to obey God rather than men, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>.<p><b>And this account has been circulated among the Jews</b><br>The spread of this false account among the Jewish people demonstrates the early opposition to the message of the resurrection. It highlights the challenges faced by the early Christian community in proclaiming the truth of Jesus' victory over death. The persistence of this narrative among the Jews also reflects the broader theme of unbelief and rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>. This opposition is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in the various accounts of resistance to the apostles' teachings in the Book of Acts.<p><b>to this very day.</b><br>The phrase "to this very day" indicates that the false narrative continued to be believed and propagated long after the events took place. This enduring disbelief serves as a reminder of the spiritual blindness that can persist despite clear evidence of God's work. It also emphasizes the importance of faith and the role of the Holy Spirit in revealing truth to individuals. The ongoing circulation of this account parallels the enduring nature of other false teachings and heresies that the early church had to confront, as addressed in the epistles of Paul and John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/soldiers.htm">Soldiers</a></b><br>Roman guards assigned to watch over Jesus' tomb to prevent His disciples from stealing His body.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders who conspired to spread a false account about Jesus' resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The burial place of Jesus, which was found empty on the third day after His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bribe.htm">The Bribe</a></b><br>Money given to the soldiers by the chief priests to spread the false account that Jesus' disciples stole His body.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people among whom the false account was circulated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_truth_over_lies.htm">The Power of Truth Over Lies</a></b><br>Despite the spread of false accounts, the truth of Jesus' resurrection has endured and transformed lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_compromise.htm">The Cost of Compromise</a></b><br>The soldiers' acceptance of the bribe serves as a warning against compromising truth for personal gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_persistence_of_opposition.htm">The Persistence of Opposition</a></b><br>Believers should expect opposition to the truth of the gospel, as seen in the early church and throughout history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_witness.htm">The Importance of Witness</a></b><br>The disciples' testimony and willingness to suffer for the truth of the resurrection highlight the importance of faithful witness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_divine_providence.htm">The Role of Divine Providence</a></b><br>God's sovereignty is evident as He uses even the schemes of His opponents to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_28_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 28:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_28_15_Rejecting_resurrection_truth.htm">How does Matthew 28:15 illustrate the consequences of rejecting the resurrection truth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Deception_in_Matt_28_15_How_to_avoid.htm">What role does deception play in Matthew 28:15, and how can we avoid it?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Matthew_28_15_to_integrity_today.htm">How can we apply the lesson of Matthew 28:15 to modern-day integrity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Truth_vs_falsehood_in_Matthew_28_15.htm">What scriptural connections highlight the importance of truth over falsehood in Matthew 28:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_28_15_Uphold_truth_in_community.htm">How does Matthew 28:15 challenge us to uphold truth in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Does_Matthew_28_15_question_resurrection.htm">How does Matthew 28:15 challenge the authenticity of the resurrection account?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_soldiers_take_a_bribe_in_Matt_28.htm">Why did the soldiers accept a bribe to spread false information in Matthew 28:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_28_15_on_resurrection_opposition.htm">What does Matthew 28:15 reveal about early opposition to the resurrection story?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_seven_deadly_sins.htm">What are the seven deadly sins?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_parties_align_with_biblical_justice.htm">How do Republican and Democrat views align with biblical social justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_there_non-biblical_proof_of_bribery.htm">The guards were reportedly bribed to lie (Matthew 28:11-15);

(<a href="/matthew/28-15.htm">Matthew 28:15</a>). A few verses earlier the chief priests had offered &#8220;a large sum of money&#8221; to these soldiers to keep silent about the resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-12.htm">Matthew 28:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226;Their acceptance shows how easily greed can cloud conscience&#8212;much like Judas, who sold Jesus for silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226;Scripture consistently warns that &#8220;the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226;The bribe also fulfills the pattern God condemns: &#8220;You shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>).<p>Despite standing witness to the angel&#8217;s appearance (<a href="/matthew/28-4.htm">Matthew 28:4</a>), the guards still chose the payoff, demonstrating that even undeniable evidence can be rejected when hearts are hard (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did as they were instructed</b><p>After pocketing the money, &#8220;the guards&#8230;did as they were instructed&#8221;&#8212;they spread the fabricated story that Jesus&#8217; disciples stole His body (<a href="/matthew/28-13.htm">Matthew 28:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226;Obedience to unrighteous commands contrasts sharply with the apostles&#8217; later conviction: &#8220;We must obey God rather than men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226;The priests had already plotted to kill Lazarus to suppress proof of Jesus&#8217; power (<a href="/john/12-10.htm">John 12:10&#8211;11</a>); now they orchestrate another cover-up.<p>&#8226;The soldiers&#8217; compliance underlines <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>: &#8220;The fear of man brings a snare,&#8221; while showcasing how fear of losing position or pay can silence truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day</b><p>Matthew, writing decades after the resurrection, testifies that the false narrative was still widely repeated.<p>&#8226;His remark underscores the historical reliability of the Gospel: readers could investigate the claim for themselves (<a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>&#8212;&#8220;this thing was not done in a corner&#8221;).<p>&#8226;The persistence of the story confirms the stakes: if the tomb was empty because Jesus rose, denial becomes imperative for those rejecting Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226;Believers, meanwhile, rest on eyewitness testimony, &#8220;for we did not follow cleverly devised myths&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>). The enduring rumor only highlights how fiercely truth is opposed (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/28-15.htm">Matthew 28:15</a> records a real payoff, a real lie, and a real campaign to smother the resurrection. The guards&#8217; greed, the leaders&#8217; manipulation, and the rumor&#8217;s longevity all underline one reality: Jesus really did rise, and opposition sprang up immediately to deny it. The verse challenges us to prize truth over comfort, obey God above human pressure, and confidently stand on the eyewitness evidence that the tomb is still empty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">This saying is commonly reported.</span>--The passage is interesting as the earliest indication of a counter-statement to the witness borne by the disciples, and as in part explaining the partial non-acceptance of their testimony. The phrase "until this day" suggests some considerable interval--say, at least, fifteen or twenty years--between the facts recorded and the composition of the narrative. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-8.htm" title="Why that field was called, The field of blood, to this day.">Matthew 27:8</a>.) Justin Martyr mentions the report as current among the Jews of his time, the Jews having sent "chosen men" into all parts of the world to propagate it (<span class= "ital">Dial. 100 Tryph.</span> c. 108).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This saying;</span> viz. the theft of the body by the disciples. <span class="cmt_word">Is commonly reported</span> (<span class="accented">was spread abroad</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>among the Jews until this day;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and continues to be reported until this day. This was true when St. Matthew wrote, and it is true at the present time, though thoughtful Jews of late years have adopted the idea that the apostles, in their excited state, were deceived by visions of Christ which they took for substantial realities (see on Matthew 27:64). In the passage of Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Tryph.,' 108.) we are told that the Jews sent emissaries in all directions to spread this false report. The evangelist shows the origin of this most improbable tale, and virtually challenges any other explanation of the miracle than the authentic one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the [guards]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
