Baptism, a ritual of purification and repentance, was performed by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. Jesus' baptism signifies His identification with humanity's sinfulness, despite His own sinlessness. It fulfills all righteousness, as Jesus Himself states in <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>, and sets a precedent for Christian baptism as an act of obedience and initiation into the faith.<p><b>He went up out of the water</b><br>This indicates the completion of the baptismal act, symbolizing death to the old life and resurrection to a new life. The act of emerging from the water prefigures Jesus' resurrection and the believer's new life in Christ. The Jordan River, where this event took place, is significant in Israel's history as the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (Joshua 3-4), symbolizing new beginnings and divine promises.<p><b>Suddenly the heavens were opened</b><br>The opening of the heavens signifies divine revelation and approval. In biblical literature, open heavens often indicate a moment of significant divine intervention or communication (<a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>, <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). This moment marks the divine endorsement of Jesus' mission and the beginning of His messianic work. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/64.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>, where the prophet longs for God to rend the heavens and come down.<p><b>and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove</b><br>The descent of the Spirit in the form of a dove symbolizes peace, purity, and the presence of God. The dove is a symbol of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit hovers over the waters, and in the story of Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8-12</a>), where the dove signifies the end of God's judgment and the beginning of a new creation. This event marks Jesus as the anointed one, the Messiah, empowered by the Spirit for His ministry.<p><b>and resting on Him</b><br>The Spirit resting on Jesus indicates a permanent endowment of divine power and presence, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah. This anointing sets Jesus apart as the chosen one of God, equipped for His redemptive mission. It also signifies the unity of the Trinity, as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all present and active in this moment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being baptized in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The forerunner of Christ, who baptizes Jesus in the Jordan River.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The location where Jesus is baptized, a significant site in biblical history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who descends upon Jesus in the form of a dove.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heavens.htm">The Heavens</a></b><br>The realm of God, which opens to signify divine approval and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_baptism.htm">The Significance of Baptism</a></b><br>Baptism is an outward expression of an inward transformation and commitment to God.

"The heavens were opened to <span class= "ital">him"</span> as they were to Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>). The Baptist bears record that he too beheld the Spirit descending (<a href="/context/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33-34</a>), but there is not the slightest ground for supposing that there was any manifestation to others. So in the vision near Damascus, St. Paul only heard the words and saw the form of Him who spake them (<a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>; <a href="/acts/22-9.htm" title="And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.">Acts 22:9</a>). That which they did see served, as did the tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost, as an attestation to the consciousness of each, of the reality of the gift imparted, and of its essential character. That descent of the Spirit, "as it were a dove," as St. Luke adds (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm" title="And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove on him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.">Luke 3:22</a>), "in bodily form," taught the Baptist, as it teaches us, that the gift of supernatural power and wisdom brought with it also the perfection of the tenderness, the purity, the gentleness of which the dove was the acknowledged symbol. To be "harmless as doves" was the command the Lord gave to His disciples (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>), and when they read this record, they were taught as we are, "of what manner of spirit" they were meant to be. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, when he was baptized</span>. Combining the statements of the synoptists, we may conclude that Jesus went up from the water at once, praying as he went, and that, while he was going up and praying, the heavens opened. <span class="cmt_word">Out of</span>; <span class="accented">from</span> '(Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>; for, as it seems, he had not gone fully out of the water. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens were opened unto him</span>. So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin, with Westcott and Herr, rightly omits "unto him." The words were inserted because it was thought that Jesus alone saw the manifestation, as indeed we should have supposed if we had had only the account of St. Mark, who reads, "he saw" before "the heavens being rent asunder" (but cf. <a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-34</a>). To our Lord and to the Baptist the appearance was as though the sky really opened (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of God</span>; recalling <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. "Messiah now enters on his public office, and for that receives, as true Man, the appropriate gifts. The Spirit by whom men are sub jectively united to God descends upon the Word made Flesh, by whom objectively God is revealed to men" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Like</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> (Revised Version). The comparison is hardly to the gentleness of the descent of a dove, but to a visible appearance in bodily form, as a dove (see parallel passage in Luke). Not, of course, that the Holy Spirit was thus at all incarnate, but that either the appearance of a dove was seen by John's eyes only (cf. especially Theodore of Mopsuestia, in Meyer), or, as is not unlikely (even though the suggestion belongs ultimately to Paulus), a dove really flew down and lighted on the Lord (Luke), and that this, to outsiders merely a curious incident (cf. <a href="/john/12-29.htm">John 12:29</a>), was to our Lord and the Baptist a sign of spiritual blessing. <span class="cmt_word">A dove</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>); any member of the pigeon tribe; chosen because a symbol of deliverance (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8</a>), of purity (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>), of harmlessness (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), and of endearment (<a href="/songs/6-9.htm">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>). There is no evidence (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:287) that the dove was <span class="accented">at this period</span> interpreted by Jews as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Targum on <a href="/songs/2-12.htm">Song of Solomon 2:12</a> paraphrasing "the voice of the turtle-dove ' by "the voice of the Holy Spirit," dates in its present form from the eighth to the tenth century. The dove mentioned (though probably by interpolation) in the account of Polycarp's death, appears to be a symbol of the soul (cf. Bishop Lightfoot). Wichelhaus (as quoted by Kubel) says suggestively, "lamb and dove - no kingdom in the world has these emblems on its escutcheon." <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; omit, with manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Lighting</span>; <span class="accented">coming</span> (Revised Version), because it is needless to translate a common Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by a rare English word. Observe that it refers to the Holy Spirit, not to the dove as such. <span class="cmt_word">Upon him</span> (so Luke and <a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; Mark more vaguely, "unto him"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] was baptized,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#914;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Baptistheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_907.htm">Strong's 907: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lit: I dip, submerge, but specifically of ceremonial dipping; I baptize. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#941;&#946;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(aneb&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_305.htm">Strong's 305: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go up, mount, ascend; of things: I rise, spring up, come up.
