The act of sitting down on the grass suggests a natural amphitheater setting, common in the Galilean region, which would have facilitated communication with a large crowd. This setting also reflects the pastoral imagery found in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord makes His people lie down in green pastures, symbolizing provision and rest. The act of sitting down indicates preparation for receiving, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>Taking the five loaves and the two fish</b><br>The five loaves and two fish highlight the meager resources available, emphasizing the miraculous nature of what is about to occur. This small amount of food, likely barley loaves and dried fish, was typical of a poor person's meal in first-century Palestine. The numbers five and two may also have symbolic significance, with five representing the Pentateuch and two possibly symbolizing witness or testimony, as seen in the requirement for two witnesses in Jewish law.<p><b>and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing.</b><br>Jesus' action of looking up to heaven signifies His dependence on the Father and acknowledges the source of all provision. This gesture is a model of prayer and thanksgiving, aligning with Jewish customs of blessing God before meals. The blessing spoken by Jesus is not recorded verbatim, but it likely followed the traditional Jewish blessing over bread, acknowledging God as the provider. This act of blessing transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, prefiguring the Eucharistic prayers in Christian tradition.<p><b>Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples,</b><br>Breaking the bread is a significant act, symbolizing the breaking of Jesus' body, which will later be commemorated in the Last Supper. This act of breaking and distributing is a type of Christ's sacrificial offering. By giving the loaves to the disciples, Jesus involves them in the miracle, teaching them about service and the distribution of God's provision. This foreshadows the role of the disciples as leaders in the early Church, tasked with spreading the Gospel and spiritual nourishment.<p><b>and the disciples gave them to the people.</b><br>The disciples' role in distributing the food illustrates the principle of stewardship and the importance of serving others. This act of distribution is a practical demonstration of faith in action, as the disciples trust in Jesus' provision. It also reflects the communal aspect of the early Christian community, where resources were shared among believers. This miracle is a precursor to the spiritual feeding that the disciples will provide through their teaching and ministry, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of feeding the 5,000.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who distribute the food to the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people, numbering about 5,000 men, not including women and children, who are fed by Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_five_loaves_and_two_fish.htm">The Five Loaves and Two Fish</a></b><br>The small amount of food that Jesus multiplies to feed the multitude.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grass.htm">The Grass</a></b><br>The place where the crowd is instructed to sit, symbolizing a place of rest and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates God's ability to provide abundantly, even from seemingly insufficient resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving_and_blessing.htm">Thanksgiving and Blessing</a></b><br>Jesus models the importance of giving thanks and seeking God's blessing before distributing resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_discipleship.htm">Role of Discipleship</a></b><br>The disciples are active participants in Jesus' miracle, highlighting the role of believers in God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The miracle encourages believers to trust in God's provision and to act in faith, even when resources appear limited.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_sharing.htm">Community and Sharing</a></b><br>The distribution of food to the crowd underscores the importance of community and sharing in the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_14_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 14:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_14_19_Jesus_power_over_nature.htm">How does Matthew 14:19 demonstrate Jesus' authority over creation and provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Gratitude_s_role_in_Matthew_14_19.htm">What role does gratitude play in Jesus' actions in Matthew 14:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_emulate_Jesus_bread_blessing_now.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example of blessing and breaking bread today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/OT_events_like_Jesus_in_Matt_14_19.htm">What Old Testament events parallel Jesus' actions in Matthew 14:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_for_provision_like_Matthew_14_19.htm">How can we trust God for provision in our lives like in Matthew 14:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_14_19_Jesus_power_over_nature_2.htm">How does Matthew 14:19 demonstrate Jesus' divine power and authority over nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_look_to_heaven_in_Matt_14_19.htm">What is the significance of Jesus looking up to heaven in Matthew 14:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Miracle_in_Matthew_14_19_vs_science.htm">How does the miracle in Matthew 14:19 challenge modern scientific understanding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_pray_for.htm">What did Jesus pray for during His ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_the_bible_support_meal_prayers.htm">Is praying before meals supported by the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_elijah_last_40_days_on_one_meal.htm">How could Elijah survive 40 days and 40 nights on a single meal with no mention of additional nourishment?

They were to sit down in companies of fifty or a hundred each, and thus the number of those who were fed became a matter of easy calculation. St. Mark, with a vivid picturesqueness, describes them as presenting the appearance of so many beds of flowers in a well-ordered garden. The bright colours of Eastern dress probably made the resemblance more striking than it would be with a like multitude so arranged among ourselves.<p><span class= "bld">Looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake.</span>--The act was natural and simple enough, the "saying grace" (St. John uses the word, "giving thanks") of the head of a Jewish household as he gathered his family around him. The formulae in such cases were commonly short and simple, like our own, such <span class= "ital">e.g.</span> as, "May God, the ever-blessed One, bless what He has given us." Looking, however, to the teaching which followed the miracle, as in John 6, and to our Lord's subsequent use at the Last Supper of the same words and acts, with others which gave them a new and higher meaning, we can hardly be wrong in thinking that as He now distributed the earthly bread to the hungering crowd, through the agency of His Apostles, there was present to His mind the thought that hereafter He would, through the same instrumentality, impart to souls that hungered after righteousness the gift of communion with Himself, that thus they might feed on the true Bread that cometh down from heaven.<p>It lies in the nature of the case, as a miracle of the highest order, that the process of multiplication is inconceivable in its details. Did each loaf, in succession, supply a thousand with food, and then come to an end, its place taken by another? Was the structure of the fishes, bone and skin and head, reproduced in each portion that was given to the guests at that great feast? We know not, and the Evangelists did not care to ask or to record. It was enough for them that the multitude "did all eat, and were filled."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> <span class="cmt_word">commanded the multitude;</span> <span class="accented">the multitudes</span> (Revised Version).

The addition of "green" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) in Mark suits the time of the Passover (ver. 13, note), but hardly of any later feast, for the grass would have been dried up. <span class="cmt_word">And took the five</span> <span class="cmt_word">loaves, and the two fishes.</span> He used all the means there were. <span class="cmt_word">And looking up</span> <span class="cmt_word">to heaven.</span> So also <a href="/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34</a>; <a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He blessed.</span> He may well have used the blessing that is still used over bread ("Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, King of the world, that causest bread to come forth from the earth"); for this can be apparently traced to the second or <span class="date">third century A.D.</span>, and is probably much older still (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:684; Zunz, 'Gottesdienstliche Vortrage,' p. 371, edit. 1832). (For the habit of saying grace before meals, cf. <a href="/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>; see also <a href="/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> That the people received the bread at the hands of the disciples is not mentioned by St. John. Perhaps because his chapter dwells so much on the need of direct contact with Christ. But Christ's work through his agents, both before and after his time on earth, is an important point with the synoptists. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/14-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He instructed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(keleusas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2753.htm">Strong's 2753: </a> </span><span class="str2">To command, order, direct, bid.
