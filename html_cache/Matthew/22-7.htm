In biblical context, God's wrath is often depicted as a response to sin and rebellion. The king's anger parallels God's response to Israel's rejection of His prophets and ultimately His Son. This anger is not impulsive but a just response to persistent disobedience.<p><b>and he sent his troops</b><br>The sending of troops signifies divine judgment. In historical context, this can be seen as a reference to the Roman armies that destroyed Jerusalem in 70 AD. Theologically, it represents God's use of earthly powers to execute His judgment. This action underscores the seriousness of rejecting God's call and the consequences that follow.<p><b>to destroy those murderers</b><br>The term "murderers" highlights the gravity of the offense. In the parable, those who rejected the king's invitation are equated with murderers, emphasizing the severity of their sin. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of Israel's history of persecuting prophets and, ultimately, the crucifixion of Jesus. It serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting God's messengers.<p><b>and burn their city</b><br>The burning of the city symbolizes complete destruction and judgment. Historically, this aligns with the destruction of Jerusalem, which was both a literal and symbolic act of divine retribution. In a broader biblical sense, it reflects the fate of those who reject God's kingdom. The imagery of fire is often associated with judgment and purification in scripture, pointing to the ultimate consequences of rejecting God's offer of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God the Father in the parable of the wedding banquet.

The text varies here. Some manuscripts have "that king," to whom the rejection of his messengers was a personal insult (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>, etc.). The Sinaitic, Vatican, and other authorities omit <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "heard thereof," and it may well be a gloss from the human view that the king, not being personally present, must have been informed of the incidents. At the same time, the King, regarded as God, needs no report to acquaint him with what is going on. <span class="cmt_word">He was wroth.</span> The injury was done to him, and he resents it (comp. <a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>; <a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His armies.</span> The Romans, under Vespasian and Titus, the unconscious instruments of his vengeance.

Some regard the "armies" as angels, the ministers of God's punishment, especially in war, famine, and pestilence, the three scourges which accomplished the ruin of the Jews. Probably both angels and men are included in the term. <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed... burned up their city.</span> No longer his city, but theirs, the murderers' city, Jerusalem. So a little later foretelling the same fate, Jesus speaks of "your house" (<a href="/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>). The Romans, in fact, some forty years after, put to the sword the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and burned the city to ashes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
