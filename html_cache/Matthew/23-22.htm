Swearing by heaven was seen as a way to avoid directly invoking God's name, which was considered sacred and not to be used lightly. However, Jesus emphasizes that heaven is not a separate entity but is intrinsically connected to God, thus making any oath by heaven an oath by God Himself. This reflects the Jewish understanding of heaven as God's dwelling place, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where God declares, "Heaven is My throne."<p><b>swears by God&#8217;s throne</b><br>The throne of God symbolizes His sovereign rule and authority over all creation. In biblical imagery, the throne is often associated with God's majesty and judgment, as depicted in visions such as those in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-3</a>. By swearing by God's throne, one is invoking the ultimate authority and acknowledging God's supreme power. This underscores the seriousness of making oaths and the importance of truthfulness, as God is the ultimate judge of all words and actions.<p><b>and by the One who sits on it.</b><br>This phrase directly points to God Himself, who is seated on the throne. It emphasizes the personal nature of God, who is not an abstract force but a sovereign being who actively rules and judges. The imagery of God sitting on the throne is consistent throughout Scripture, highlighting His eternal kingship and divine authority, as seen in <a href="/psalms/47-8.htm">Psalm 47:8</a>, "God reigns over the nations; God sits on His holy throne." This also connects to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who is described as sitting at the right hand of God, sharing in His authority and glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of the reverence due to God and the accountability of one's words before Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the scribes and Pharisees in a series of woes, highlighting their hypocrisy and misunderstanding of the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders who are being criticized by Jesus for their legalism and lack of true understanding of God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God, often used in Jewish culture as a way to refer to God indirectly.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_throne.htm">God&#8217;s Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's sovereign rule and authority over all creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_sits_on_it.htm">The One who sits on it</a></b><br>Refers to God Himself, emphasizing His ultimate authority and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority.htm">Understanding Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that swearing by heaven is not a trivial matter because it involves God's throne and His authority.

Because heaven is God&#8217;s dwelling, the throne His seat, and He Himself occupies that seat, all swearing is ultimately &#8220;by God.&#8221; Believers, therefore, must speak with such integrity that oaths become unnecessary, remembering they live every moment before the throne of the One who sits on it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By heaven.</span> The Talmndists affirm that an oath "by heaven" or "by earth" was not binding, on the ground, probably, that these were mere creatures. Christ again dissipates such sophistries. To swear by the creature is virtually to swear by the Creator. A brute, inanimate thing cannot be witness to an oath; he alone can be appealed to who owns all. Thus we "kiss the book," calling God to witness our words. Christ had already given a lesson to his followers on this subject in the sermon on the mount (ch. Matthew 5:34-37). He inculcates true reverence, that fear and awe of God's dignity and God's presence which constrains a man to avoid all profaneness and carelessness in regard to things that are concerned with God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
