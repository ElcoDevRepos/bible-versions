His betrayal was prophesied in the Old Testament, notably in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the psalmist. Judas's role fulfills this prophecy, highlighting the foreknowledge of God and the fulfillment of Scripture. His betrayal is a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative, setting in motion the events leading to the crucifixion.<p><b>saw that Jesus was condemned</b><br>Judas's realization that Jesus was condemned marks a turning point in his story. The condemnation of Jesus by the religious leaders was a fulfillment of the prophecies concerning the suffering Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. Judas's actions contributed to this outcome, and his witnessing of the condemnation may have brought the gravity of his betrayal into sharp focus. The Sanhedrin's decision to condemn Jesus was influenced by their fear of losing power and control, as Jesus's teachings challenged their authority.<p><b>he was filled with remorse</b><br>Judas's remorse indicates a deep sense of guilt and regret for his actions. However, this remorse does not equate to true repentance, which involves a turning away from sin and seeking forgiveness. Judas's regret is contrasted with Peter's repentance after denying Jesus, showing different responses to sin. The Greek word used here for remorse suggests an emotional response rather than a change of heart, highlighting the tragic nature of Judas's end.<p><b>and returned the thirty pieces of silver</b><br>The thirty pieces of silver were the price Judas agreed upon with the chief priests to betray Jesus, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>. This amount fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which speaks of the thirty pieces of silver as the price set for the shepherd. Judas's return of the money signifies his attempt to undo his betrayal, but it is ultimately futile. The silver coins, a symbol of his treachery, become a testimony to the fulfillment of prophecy and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>to the chief priests and elders</b><br>The chief priests and elders were the religious leaders responsible for maintaining the temple and upholding Jewish law. Their involvement in Jesus's condemnation reflects the religious establishment's rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. By returning the silver to them, Judas acknowledges their role in the conspiracy against Jesus. This act also underscores the religious leaders' complicity in the events leading to the crucifixion, as they prioritized their authority over recognizing the truth of Jesus's identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus to the religious authorities for thirty pieces of silver.

Judas, once a close follower, betrays the Lord for a slave&#8217;s price, then reels under remorse when he sees Jesus condemned. His attempt to return the silver shows that human efforts cannot reverse guilt or halt God&#8217;s redemptive plan. True repentance looks to the Savior; mere regret ends in despair. Scripture presents the scene as a sober warning: acknowledge Jesus as Lord now, or live with the unbearable consequences of rejecting Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Then Judas, which had betrayed him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the betrayer.</span> The Greek participle is in the present tense. The narrative which follows is found only in St. Matthew, but another version of the same facts is given in <a href="/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18</a>. Here, too, as in the case of Peter, we have to guess at motives. Had he looked for any other result than this? Was he hoping that his Lord, when forced to a decision, would assert His claim as the Christ, put forth His power, and triumph over His enemies, and that so he would gain at once the reward of treachery and the credit of having contributed to establish the Kingdom? This has been maintained by some eminent writers, and it is certainly possible, but the mere remorse of one who, after acting in the frenzy of criminal passion, sees the consequences of his deeds in all their horror, furnishes an adequate explanation of what follows.<p><span class= "bld">Repented himself.</span>--The Greek word is not that commonly used for "repentance," as involving a change of mind and heart, but is rather <span class= "ital">"</span>regret," a simple change of feeling. The coins which he had once gazed on and clutched at eagerly were now hateful in his sight, and their touch like that of molten metal from the furnace. He must get rid of them somehow. There is something terribly suggestive in the fact that here there were no tears as there had been in Peter's repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-10.</span> - <span class="accented">Remorse and suicide of Judas, and the use made of the blood money.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew; cf. <a href="/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18, 19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. This transaction took place either when Jesus was being conducted to the Praetorium, or during the interview with Herod (<a href="/luke/23-7.htm">Luke 23:7-11</a>). A great number of the Sanhedrists had now withdrawn to the temple, and were sitting in conclave there. <span class="cmt_word">When he saw that he was condemned.</span> He evidently had not contemplated the full consequences of his crime; he never expected that the Jewish rulers would proceed to such extremities. It is probable that, in his lust for gain and his loss of love for his Master, he had. thought of nothing but his own sordid interests, and now was appalled at the share which he had had in bringing to pass this awful result. The excuse made in modern days for Judas, that he wished only to force our Lord to exert his Divine power, and to declare himself Messiah, is refuted by one out of many considerations (see on Matthew 26:14). His remorse at this moment has to be accounted for. If he still believed in Christ's Divine commission, he would not have despaired of a happy result even after his condemnation, nay, even when he was hanging on the cross. Christ's power to deliver himself and to assume his Messianic position remained unimpaired by these seemingly adverse circumstances, and a believer would have waited for the end before he surrendered all hope. Judas's character is not bettered by considering that he did evil that good might come, or that he was led to his base course by the hope that his worldly interests would be improved by the establishment of Messiah's temporal kingdom. That he had now any desire or ambition for a place in a spiritual kingdom cannot be conceived, for he had evidently lost all faith in Jesus, and followed him only for the most sordid motives. <span class="cmt_word">Repented himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>). This word (differing from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, which expresses change of heart) denotes only a change of feeling, a desire that what has been done could be undone; this is not repentance in the Scripture sense; it springs not from love of God, it has not that character which calls for pardon. "Mark," says St. Chrysostom, "when it is that he feels remorse. When his sin was completed, and had received an accomplishment. For the devil is like this; he suffers not those who are careless to see the evil before this, lest he whom he has taken should repent. At least, when Jesus was saying so many things, he was not influenced, but when his offence was completed, then repentance came upon him, and not then profitably." Only now did he fully realize what he had done; in the light of his crime his conscience awoke and confounded him with vehement re-preaches: the object for which he had sinned seemed utterly unworthy and base; its attraction vanished when no longer pursued. <span class="cmt_word">Brought again</span> (<span class="accented">returned</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the thirty pieces of silver.</span> He had received the whole price for which he had bargained, but he could not retain the money now; it was a silent witness which he could not endure.
