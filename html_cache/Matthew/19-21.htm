In the context of <a href="/matthew/19.htm">Matthew 19</a>, Jesus is addressing a rich young ruler who is seeking eternal life. This encounter highlights Jesus' role as a teacher and His ability to discern the heart's true intentions.<p><b>If you want to be perfect</b><br>The term "perfect" here refers to spiritual maturity and completeness, not flawlessness. In Jewish thought, perfection often meant fulfilling God's commandments fully. Jesus is challenging the young man to go beyond mere legalistic adherence to the law and to seek a deeper, wholehearted devotion to God.<p><b>go, sell your possessions and give to the poor</b><br>This command addresses the young man's attachment to wealth, which is a barrier to his spiritual growth. In first-century Jewish culture, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet Jesus challenges this notion by prioritizing generosity and care for the poor. This echoes the teachings of the prophets, such as Isaiah and Amos, who emphasized justice and mercy.<p><b>and you will have treasure in heaven</b><br>Jesus contrasts earthly wealth with heavenly treasure, urging a focus on eternal values. This concept is consistent with other teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven. The idea of heavenly rewards is a recurring theme in the New Testament, encouraging believers to live with an eternal perspective.<p><b>Then come, follow Me</b><br>This invitation to follow Jesus is central to discipleship. It implies a total commitment and willingness to prioritize Jesus above all else. The call to follow is not just physical but involves a transformation of life and priorities. This echoes Jesus' earlier calls to His disciples and highlights the cost of true discipleship, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the kingdom of heaven and the requirements for eternal life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_young_man.htm">The Rich Young Man</a></b><br>A wealthy individual who approaches Jesus seeking guidance on how to obtain eternal life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present during this interaction and later question Jesus about the implications of His teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_radical_discipleship.htm">The Call to Radical Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus' instruction to the rich young man to "sell your possessions and give to the poor" (<a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>) is a call to radical discipleship. It challenges believers to examine what they value most and to prioritize their relationship with God above all else.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_the_matter.htm">The Heart of the Matter</a></b><br>The Greek word for "perfect" (teleios) in this context implies completeness or maturity. Jesus is inviting the young man to a mature faith that is not hindered by material wealth. Believers are encouraged to seek spiritual maturity by aligning their hearts with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_investments.htm">Eternal Investments</a></b><br>The promise of "treasure in heaven" (<a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>) serves as a reminder that earthly possessions are temporary. Christians are called to invest in eternal values, such as generosity, compassion, and service to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_challenge_of_wealth.htm">The Challenge of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can be a significant barrier to spiritual growth if it becomes an idol. Jesus' teaching encourages believers to assess their relationship with money and to use their resources for God's kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/following_jesus.htm">Following Jesus</a></b><br>The invitation to "come, follow Me" (<a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>) is central to Christian discipleship.

The path to perfection is not accumulation but abandonment&#8212;abandonment of idols, security, and self-rule&#8212;so that we may walk closely with the One whose worth surpasses every earthly possession.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Jesus said unto him . . .</span>--St. Mark (<a href="/mark/10-21.htm" title="Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.">Mark 10:21</a>) adds the striking and interesting words, "Jesus beholding him" (better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">gazing on him</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> "loved him." There was something in the young seeker after holiness which drew to him, in a measure altogether exceptional, the affection of the Great Teacher. The same word is used in regard to him which is used in relation to the "disciple whom Jesus loved," and (here the coincidence takes its place in the chain of evidence for the view above suggested) to Lazarus, and Martha, and Mary (<a href="/john/11-5.htm" title="Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.">John 11:5</a>). There was the fervour, the longing after a higher life, the personal trust, which made him a not unworthy object of the love of Jesus, and therefore He would not spare the discipline which the questioner needed, the test which, being such as he was, was required for the completeness of his life.<p><span class= "bld">If thou wilt be perfect.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">if thou wishest.</span> St. Mark and St. Luke report the words, "One thing thou lackest," reminding us forcibly of the "One thing is needful" of <a href="/luke/10-42.htm" title="But one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.">Luke 10:42</a>. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/19-16.htm" title="And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?">Matthew 19:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Go and sell that thou hast.</span>--It would be altogether a mistake to see in this either an obligation binding on all seekers after eternal life, or even what has been called a "counsel of perfection," a precept laying down an indispensable condition for all who aim at its higher forms and powers. It was strictly a remedy for the special evil which hindered the young ruler's progress to perfection, applicable to others so far only as their cases are analogous. It would be idle to deny that there have been and are many such analogous types of character, and so far as any one is conscious of being under the power of wealth and its temptations, so far there is a call to some act asserting his victory over those temptations, in the spirit, if not in the letter, of the command thus given. But it is, we must remember, the spirit, and not the letter, which is binding. Distribution to the poor was then almost the only form of charity. A wider range of action is presented by the organisation of modern Christian societies, and the same sacrifice may be made in ways more productive of true and permanent good; in the foundation, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> of schools or hospitals, in the erection of churches, in the maintenance of home or foreign missions.<p><span class= "bld">Treasure in heaven.</span>--The parallelism with the Sermon on the Mount should not be forgotten (5:20). The "treasure" is the "eternal life" which the young ruler was seeking, the memory of good deeds, the character formed and perfected, the vision of the presence of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">be perfect.</span> I believe what you tell me. You have led a religious life in the ordinary way; now yon aspire to higher things; you have a noble ambition to serve God more completely; yon have the power, if you have the will, to do so; I will tell you how. To be "perfect" is to be lacking in nothing that is required for life eternal. It is spoken of Noah and Job; it is required of Christ's disciples (<a href="/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). Christ is here giving a counsel of perfection, as it is called, not of obligation on all men, but suited to the idiosyncrasy of this particular inquirer, and of others who are capable of such absolute self-surrender and trustfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Go</span> and <span class="cmt_word">sell that thou hast.</span> Go back to thy home, and sell all thy substance, all thy possessions. This was the counsel which Jesus gave, denoting the stumbling block which lay in the way of the ruler's endeavours after perfection. He was voluntarily to deprive himself of the earthly thing to which he fondly clung, his wealth, and to embrace a life of poverty and hardship. <span class="cmt_word">Give to the poor.</span> The money obtained by the sale of his possessions he was to distribute, not to relations and friends, who might make some return, but to the poor, from whom he could expect no recompense. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt have treasure in heaven</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>). Thou shalt obtain that which thou desirest, eternal life. Not that stripping one's self of goods and giving to the poor does necessarily ensure the great reward, but, in this youth's case, such a sacrifice, such a victory over the besetting sin, would be the turning point in his character, and enable him to conquer all lesser temptations, and win the prize of his high calling. Here was to be proved love of man. But there was one more element in the required perfection, viz. love of God. <span class="cmt_word">Come</span> and <span class="cmt_word">follow me</span>. St Mark adds, "take up the cross." If he would have apostolic perfection, he must embrace the apostolic life. He must give up wealth, position, earthly ties, earthly occupations, must cast in his lot with the despised Jesus, suffer with him, and, if necessary, die with him. The twelve apostles had accepted Christ's call on these terms; from him was demanded the same sacrifice the same test of sincerity. He had wished to be exceptionally good; exceptional conduct was required from him in order to reach this high standard. The condition imposed, severe as it undoubtedly was, exactly suited the case, showed the weak spot in the ruler's character, and, if accepted fully and heartily, would have led him to perfection. Reading these words of our Lord, St. Anthony was so stricken in heart and conscience that he obeyed them literally, stripped himself of everything that he had, distributed to the needy, and went forth poor and naked, trusting to God to provide for him. Many in all ages, inspired by ardent love of life eternal, have done the same. We shall do well to recognize that there are two ways of serving God acceptably - there is the good life required from all religious Christians, and there is the life of perfection to which some, by God's special grace, are called, and which they embrace and fulfil. It was the latter life that Christ put before this young man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#966;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Eph&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5346.htm">Strong's 5346: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, declare.
