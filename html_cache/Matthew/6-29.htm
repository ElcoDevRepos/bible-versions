In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus often uses "I tell you" to introduce teachings that deepen or fulfill the Law and the Prophets. It underscores His role as a teacher with divine authority, echoing the prophetic tradition where God speaks directly to His people.<p><b>that not even Solomon</b><br>Solomon, the son of David, was the third king of Israel and is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem. His reign is often considered the pinnacle of Israel's earthly glory. Referencing Solomon highlights the contrast between human splendor and divine provision. Solomon's story is found in <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1-11</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/1.htm">2 Chronicles 1-9</a>.<p><b>in all his glory</b><br>Solomon's glory refers to his immense wealth, wisdom, and the splendor of his kingdom. <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a> describes the opulence of Solomon's court, including his vast wealth and the grandeur of his possessions. This phrase serves to remind the audience of the highest human achievements in terms of material wealth and splendor.<p><b>was adorned</b><br>The term "adorned" suggests being clothed or decorated, often used in the context of preparing for a special occasion or to signify status. In biblical times, clothing was a significant indicator of wealth and position. The adornment of Solomon would have included luxurious garments and precious jewels, symbolizing the height of human achievement in appearance.<p><b>like one of these</b><br>"These" refers to the lilies of the field mentioned in the preceding verses (<a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28</a>). Jesus uses the lilies as a metaphor for God's provision and care in nature, which surpasses human efforts. The lilies, effortlessly beautiful and provided for by God, serve as a reminder of divine care and the futility of human anxiety over material needs. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24-28</a> and <a href="/luke/12-27.htm">Luke 12:27-28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, teaching about trust in God's provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his wisdom, wealth, and the splendor of his kingdom, often seen as a symbol of earthly glory and success.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A collection of teachings by Jesus found in Matthew chapters 5-7, addressing various aspects of righteous living and faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lilies_of_the_field.htm">The Lilies of the Field</a></b><br>Used by Jesus as an example of God's provision and care, illustrating the beauty and simplicity of God's creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teachings, emphasizing spiritual values over material wealth and earthly concerns.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that God's care for His creation surpasses even the greatest human achievements.
