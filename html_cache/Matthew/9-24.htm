The command to "go away" signifies Jesus' authority over the situation and His intention to perform a miracle. In Jewish culture, professional mourners were often hired to lament the dead, and their presence indicates the finality of death in the eyes of the community. Jesus' directive to dismiss them underscores His power over life and death, setting the stage for a divine act that challenges the natural order.<p><b>&#8220;The girl is not dead, but asleep.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus uses the term "asleep" to describe the girl's condition, which is a euphemism for death found elsewhere in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>). This language reflects a biblical worldview where death is not the end but a temporary state before resurrection. Jesus' statement is a declaration of His authority over death, foreshadowing His own resurrection and the promise of eternal life for believers. It also serves to test the faith of those present, as they must choose to believe in His power or rely on their understanding of death.<p><b>And they laughed at Him.</b><br>The reaction of laughter from the mourners and onlookers highlights their disbelief and skepticism. In the cultural context, laughter can signify scorn or ridicule, indicating that the people did not take Jesus' words seriously. This response contrasts with the faith that Jesus seeks from His followers. The laughter also serves to emphasize the miraculous nature of what Jesus is about to do, as it sets up a stark contrast between human doubt and divine intervention. This moment is a reminder of the frequent misunderstanding and rejection Jesus faced during His ministry, as well as the call for believers to trust in His words despite worldly skepticism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His authority over life and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_girl.htm">The Girl</a></b><br>- The daughter of a synagogue leader, presumed dead by those around her.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mourners.htm">The Mourners</a></b><br>- Individuals present at the house, likely professional mourners, who laughed at Jesus' statement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>- The setting of this event, where the girl lay and the mourners gathered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue_leader.htm">The Synagogue Leader (Jairus)</a></b><br>- Though not named in Matthew, other Gospel accounts identify him as Jairus, a man of faith seeking Jesus' help for his daughter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>Jesus' statement challenges us to trust in His power over life and death, even when circumstances seem hopeless.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perspective_on_death.htm">Perspective on Death</a></b><br>Jesus redefines death as sleep, offering a perspective of hope and resurrection for believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_skepticism.htm">Responding to Skepticism</a></b><br>The laughter of the mourners highlights the world's skepticism towards divine power, encouraging believers to stand firm in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>This passage underscores Jesus' divine authority, inviting us to rely on Him in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ.htm">Hope in Christ</a></b><br>The assurance that Jesus can bring life from death provides hope and comfort in times of loss.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_9_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 9:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_24_Jesus_life-death_power.htm">How does Matthew 9:24 demonstrate Jesus' authority over life and death?

In <a href="/mark/5-39.htm">Mark 5:39&#8211;40</a> He does the same: &#8220;Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep. And they laughed at Him.

He proceeds, takes the girl by the hand, and she rises (<a href="/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>), proving <a href="/romans/3-3.htm">Romans 3:3</a> true: &#8220;What if some did not believe?
