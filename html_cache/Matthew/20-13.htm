The response is directed to one of the laborers who felt wronged, highlighting the personal nature of God's relationship with each individual. This reflects the biblical theme of God addressing individuals directly, as seen in His interactions with figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Friend, I am not being unfair to you.</b><br>The term "friend" is used to address the worker, indicating a relationship that is not hostile despite the complaint. This mirrors Jesus' use of "friend" in other parables (<a href="/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12, 26</a>:50), suggesting a tone of gentle correction. The concept of fairness is central to the parable, emphasizing God's justice and generosity. The landowner's fairness is rooted in the agreed-upon terms, reflecting God's faithfulness to His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><b>Did you not agree with me on one denarius?</b><br>A denarius was a common day's wage for a laborer in Roman times, reflecting the economic context of the period. The agreement on this wage underscores the fairness of the landowner's actions. This phrase highlights the importance of covenant and agreement, echoing the biblical theme of God's covenants with His people (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>).

The focus shifts from a group grievance to a personal conversation, stressing individual accountability (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors the father&#8217;s appeal to the resentful older brother in <a href="/luke/15-28.htm">Luke 15:28-31</a>, where one-on-one dialogue exposes the heart issue rather than the wage issue.<p>&#8226; God does not ignore grumbling; He lovingly engages it so that motives come to light (<a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Friend</b><p>&#8226; The address &#8220;Friend&#8221; shows kindness, not sarcasm. The landowner invites relationship even while correcting (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a>).<p>&#8226; While the worker feels wronged, the master reminds him that they are not adversaries. Graceful confrontation springs from covenant love, not hostility (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am not being unfair to you</b><p>&#8226; The statement asserts the master&#8217;s justice.

The master&#8217;s fairness stands alongside his freedom to be lavish with others (<a href="/romans/9-14.htm">Romans 9:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By declaring &#8220;I am not being unfair,&#8221; the landowner reorients the worker from emotions to facts&#8212;exactly what God does when we question His dealings (<a href="/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did you not agree with me on one denarius?</b><p>&#8226; The reminder reaches back to the original agreement (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>). Covenant terms were set and honored. God never retracts His promises (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The question underlines consent: the worker entered the vineyard willingly. Likewise, those who follow Christ accept His terms, trusting His character (<a href="/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting the agreed wage, the master exposes the true complaint: resentment that others received more grace, not that he received less justice (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/20-13.htm">Matthew 20:13</a> reveals a just and gracious Master who personally engages our grumbling, reminds us of our relationship to Him, affirms His flawless fairness, and calls us back to the agreement we made. The verse challenges envy and underscores that God&#8217;s generosity toward others never diminishes His faithfulness to us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Friend.</span>--The word so translated (literally, <span class= "ital">comrade, companion</span>) always carries, with it in our Lord's lips a tone of reproof. It is addressed to the man who had not on a wedding garment (<a href="/matthew/22-12.htm" title="And he said to him, Friend, how came you in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.">Matthew 22:12</a>), and to the traitor Judas (<a href="/matthew/26-50.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you come?

Had the first-called labourers shared this generosity, they would not have grudged the others the wages that they themselves received, and would have found their own reward in sympathy with their joy. This would be true even in the outer framework of the parable. It is <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> true when we pass to its spiritual interpretation. <span class= "ital">No</span> disciple who had entered into his Master's spirit would grudge the repentant thief his rest in Paradise (<a href="/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>). No consistent Christian thinks that he ought to have some special reward because he sees a death-bed repentance crowned by a peace, the foretaste of eternal life, as full and assured as his own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered one of them.</span> The Lord condescended to show, not to all the labourers, but to one of them - the ringleader probably - the futility of the ground of his murmur. Christ often explains himself to his friends, while he refuses further elucidation to enemies and the hardened. <span class="cmt_word">Friend</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>). Not a term of affection, or special good will, but one of indifference, addressed to an inferior. It was the word used to Judas (<a href="/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a>) when he came to betray his Lord, "Friend, wherefore art thou come?" <span class="cmt_word">I do thee no wrong.</span> The labourer had really nothing to complain of in strict justice; he had received the full amount of the stipulated wages. But he very naturally felt that he had not been fairly dealt with. He would say to himself, "If one hour's work, and that in the cool of the evening, is deemed worth a penny, surely a whole day's labour, in the full heat of the sun, ought to deserve a higher remuneration." The difficulty here must be felt by every one. Nor is the master's solution perfect; it would scarcely commend itself to the dissatisfied murmurer. And doubtless it is not intended to be complete. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he answered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#957;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(heni)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
