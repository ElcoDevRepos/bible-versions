In Jewish culture, evening begins at sunset, marking the end of the Sabbath and the beginning of a new day. This timing is significant as it follows the crucifixion of Jesus, which occurred earlier in the day. The evening is a time of transition, symbolizing the shift from the sorrow of the crucifixion to the hope of the resurrection.<p><b>there came a rich man from Arimathea</b><br>Joseph of Arimathea is introduced as a wealthy individual. His wealth is significant because it fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which states that the Messiah would be buried with the rich. Arimathea is believed to be a town in Judea, though its exact location is not definitively known. Joseph's wealth and status would have given him the influence necessary to approach Pilate and request Jesus' body.<p><b>named Joseph</b><br>Joseph is a common Jewish name, but this Joseph is distinguished by his association with Arimathea and his role in the burial of Jesus. His actions demonstrate courage and devotion, as he risks his reputation and standing by associating with Jesus, who had been condemned as a criminal.<p><b>who himself was a disciple of Jesus</b><br>Joseph is described as a disciple, indicating that he was a follower and believer in Jesus. This is significant because it shows that even among the Jewish leaders, there were those who recognized Jesus as the Messiah. Joseph's discipleship is characterized by his actions rather than public declarations, reflecting a faith that is expressed through deeds. His involvement in Jesus' burial is a testament to his commitment and belief in Jesus' teachings and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph_of_arimathea.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a></b><br>A wealthy man and a member of the Jewish council (Sanhedrin) who had become a disciple of Jesus.

He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.">John 19:38</a>), that he was "a disciple, but secretly for fear of the Jews." He was apparently a man of the same class and type of character as Nicodemus, respecting our Lord as a man, admiring Him as a teacher, half-believing in Him as the Christ, and yet, till now, shrinking from confessing Him before men. For us the name has the interest of being one of the few New Testament names connected with our own country. He was sent, it was said, by Philip (the Apostle) to Britain. There, in the legend which mediaeval chroniclers delighted to tell, he founded the Church of Glastonbury; and the staff which he stuck into the ground took root and brought forth leaves and flowers, and became the parent of all the Glastonbury thorns from that day to this. We have to place the piercing of the side, narrated by St. John only (<a href="/context/john/19-31.htm" title="The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.">John 19:31-37</a>), before Joseph's application. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 57-61.</span> - <span class="accented">The burial of the body of Jesus.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42-47</a>; <a href="/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50-56</a>; <a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-42</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the even was come.</span> This was what was called the first evening, the time between the ninth hour, or three o'clock, and sunset, and the great sabbath would shortly be beginning. It was the Roman custom to leave criminals hanging on the cross for days, till their bodies were devoured by birds and wild animals; the Jewish Law enacted that when bodies were penally suspended, they should be taken down and buried before night (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>), that the land might not be defiled. Tomorrow (beginning at sunset), being a specially solemn day, as combining the sabbath and the Passover celebration, the Jews were particularly anxious that the crucified bodies of our Lord and the two robbers should be taken away and put out of sight before the sabbath began. To effect this object, they went to Pilate, and begged him to put an end to their sufferings by the sharp, short process of breaking their legs. St. John's account must be referred to for this and the result of the soldiers' examination of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">There came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.</span> He is further said to have been "an honourable counsellor," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a member of the Sanhedrin, "a good man and a just, who also waited for the kingdom of God, and had not consented to the counsel and deed" of the rest of the rulers. "It was divinely appointed," says the Ven. Bede, "that Joseph should be rich, in order to have access to Pilate, for no mean man could have access to the governor; and that he should be a just man, in order to receive the body of our Lord." This man's native place was Arimathaea, a town with much probability identified with Ramathaim-Zophim of <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, which lay in Mount Ephraim, and was the birthplace of the Prophet Samuel. That he was "a rich man" naturally gave him some influence with Pilate, and joined with his position as a Sanhedrist, made his request more likely to be granted. "One Joseph was appointed by God to be guardian of Christ's body in the virgin womb, and another Joseph was the guardian of his body in the virgin tomb, and each Joseph is called a 'just man' in Holy Scripture" (Wordsworth). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-57.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(genomen&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evening,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8008;&#968;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Opsias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3798.htm">Strong's 3798: </a> </span><span class="str2">Late, evening.
