Joseph's response to the angel's warning in a dream (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>) demonstrates his faithfulness and readiness to protect Jesus. This reflects the biblical theme of prompt obedience to God's commands, as seen in figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>).<p><b>took the Child and His mother</b><br>Joseph's role as the protector and guardian of Jesus and Mary is emphasized here. The order of "the Child and His mother" highlights Jesus' centrality. This mirrors the care and protection God provides for His people, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God leads and protects Israel.<p><b>by night</b><br>Traveling by night suggests urgency and the need for secrecy, likely to avoid detection by Herod's forces. This reflects the perilous circumstances surrounding Jesus' early life and the fulfillment of God's plan despite human opposition. Night travel also symbolizes the spiritual darkness from which Jesus, the Light of the World, would deliver humanity.<p><b>and withdrew to Egypt</b><br>Egypt serves as a place of refuge, echoing the Old Testament narrative of Joseph, who also found refuge in Egypt (Genesis 37-50). This move fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, "Out of Egypt I called My Son," drawing a parallel between Israel's exodus and Jesus' return from Egypt.

The legends of the Apocryphal Gospels, embodied in many forms of poetry and art, show how easily, in later times, the fabulous element crystallised round the Gospel nucleus of fact. The idols of Egypt bowed or fell down before the divine child; a well sprung up under the palm-tree that gave the traveller shelter. They were attacked by robbers, and owed their preservation to the pity of Dismas, one of the band, who was afterwards the penitent thief of the crucifixion. How far the journey extended we cannot tell. It would have been enough for Joseph's object to pass the so-called River of Egypt, which separated that country from the region under Herod's sovereignty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he arose, he took</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and he arose and took.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here, as in ver. 13, precludes delay. <span class="cmt_word">The young Child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt</span>. As St. Paul in after years was able to connect himself with fellow-craftsmen, and thus maintain himself (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>), so might Joseph reasonably expect to be able to do in Egypt, and the more so since the connexion there between those who worked at the same trade seems to have been even closer than elsewhere, for in the great synagogue at Alexandria they sat together, "so that if a stranger came he could join himself to his fellow-craftsmen and, through their means, obtain his livelihood" (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Suecah,' 5:1, p. 55, d). Jewish reference to our Lord's stay in Egypt are to be found in the blasphemous tables of his having brought thence his knowledge of magic (cf.
