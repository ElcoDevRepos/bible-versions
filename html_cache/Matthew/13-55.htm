The term "carpenter" (Greek: "tekton") indicates a craftsman or builder, suggesting a humble and ordinary profession. This highlights the humanity of Jesus, who was raised in a working-class family. The question implies doubt about Jesus' authority and divine mission, as the townspeople struggle to reconcile His ordinary upbringing with His extraordinary teachings and miracles. This skepticism fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be "despised and rejected" (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>Isn&#8217;t His mother&#8217;s name Mary,</b><br>Mary, the mother of Jesus, is a central figure in the Gospels. Her mention here emphasizes the familiarity the townspeople had with Jesus' family, which contributed to their disbelief. Mary is portrayed as a faithful servant of God, chosen to bear the Messiah (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>). Her role in Jesus' life is significant, as she witnessed His first miracle at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>) and was present at His crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25-27</a>).<p><b>and aren&#8217;t His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</b><br>This phrase lists the names of Jesus' brothers, indicating that He had a larger family. James, later known as James the Just, became a leader in the early church and authored the Epistle of James. Joseph, Simon, and Judas (also known as Jude, who wrote the Epistle of Jude) are less prominent in the New Testament. The mention of Jesus' brothers underscores His full humanity and the normalcy of His family life. It also highlights the initial unbelief of His family, as noted in <a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>, though they later became followers after His resurrection (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Referred to indirectly as "the carpenter's son," highlighting His humble earthly origins and the skepticism of those in His hometown.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Mentioned indirectly as "the carpenter," emphasizing his trade and the humble beginnings of Jesus' earthly family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>Jesus' mother, known for her faithfulness and obedience to God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/james,_joseph,_simon,_and_judas.htm">James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas</a></b><br>Jesus' brothers, indicating His familial ties and the normalcy of His upbringing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>The hometown of Jesus, where He faced skepticism and disbelief from those who knew Him growing up.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humility_of_christ's_earthly_life.htm">The Humility of Christ's Earthly Life</a></b><br>Jesus' humble beginnings remind us that God often works through the ordinary and the overlooked.

Justin Martyr (<span class= "ital">Dial. c. Tryph.</span> c. 88) relates that in his time articles said to have been made by Him, such as rakes and harrows, were in demand as relics.
