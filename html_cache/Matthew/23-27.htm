The term "woe" is a strong expression of judgment and lament. The scribes and Pharisees were respected for their knowledge of the Law and their religious practices, yet Jesus calls them "hypocrites," indicating a discrepancy between their outward actions and inward intentions. This critique aligns with Old Testament prophets like Isaiah, who condemned similar hypocrisy (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>You are like whitewashed tombs,</b><br>In ancient Jewish culture, tombs were often whitewashed to make them visible and prevent ritual impurity from accidental contact. This practice was especially common before Passover. The whitewashing made the tombs appear clean and pure, yet they contained death and decay. This metaphor highlights the contrast between the Pharisees' outward appearance of righteousness and their inner corruption.<p><b>which look beautiful on the outside</b><br>The Pharisees maintained an appearance of piety and adherence to the Law, which was admired by the people. This external beauty is symbolic of their religious rituals and public displays of devotion. However, Jesus emphasizes that external appearances can be deceiving, a theme echoed in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>but on the inside are full of dead men&#8217;s bones and every kind of impurity.</b><br>This imagery of death and impurity signifies spiritual decay and moral corruption. In Jewish law, contact with a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-16</a>). Jesus uses this metaphor to illustrate the spiritual state of the Pharisees, who, despite their outward religious observance, were spiritually dead and impure. This internal corruption is contrasted with the purity and life that Jesus offers, as seen in His teachings on the heart and inner transformation (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the religious leaders of His time with a strong rebuke.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish scholars and teachers of the Law, responsible for interpreting and teaching the Scriptures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions, often criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/whitewashed_tombs.htm">Whitewashed Tombs</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Jesus to describe the outward appearance of righteousness that conceals inner corruption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus delivered this discourse, a central place for Jewish worship and religious authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hypocrisy.htm">The Danger of Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Hypocrisy is a serious sin that Jesus condemns.

(<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>).

It should be noticed that the similitude in <a href="/luke/11-44.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.">Luke 11:44</a> is drawn from the graves that were <span class= "ital">not</span> whitened, or from which the whitewash had been worn away, and over which men passed without knowing of their contact with corruption. Some have thought, indeed, that this passage also refers to graves which had lost the coat of whitewash, and were "beautiful with grass and flowers." It seems hardly likely, however, that the perfect participle would be used to describe such a state of things, and it is more probable, looking to the date above given, that our Lord pointed to some tombs that were shining in their new whiteness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="accented">Seventh woe</span> - against another form of the same hypocrisy (<a href="/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whited</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>sepulchres.</span> Once a year, about the fifteenth of the month Adar, the Jews used to whitewash the tombs and the places where corpses were buried, partly out of respect for the dead, but chiefly in order to make them conspicuous, and thus to obviate the risk of persons incautiously contracting ceremonial defilement by touching or walking over them (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). To such sepulchres our Lord compares these Pharisees, because their outwardly fair show concealed rottenness within (comp. <a href="/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>). Indeed, it might be said that their seeming exceptional purity was a warning of internal corruption, a sign post to point to hidden defilement.
