It reflects a common human tendency to judge past generations while failing to recognize similar faults in oneself. This self-assured statement sets the stage for Jesus' critique of their hypocrisy.<p><b>&#8216;If we had lived in the days of our fathers,</b><br>The reference to "the days of our fathers" points to the historical context of Israel's past, particularly the times of the prophets. The religious leaders claim a moral superiority over their ancestors, suggesting they would have acted differently. This reflects a misunderstanding of their own spiritual condition and a lack of awareness of their complicity in similar sins.<p><b>we would not have been partners with them</b><br>The term "partners" implies complicity and shared responsibility. The leaders assert that they would not have participated in the wrongful actions of their ancestors. This claim is ironic, as Jesus points out their current rejection of Him, the ultimate Prophet. The statement reveals a disconnect between their self-perception and their actual behavior.<p><b>in shedding the blood of the prophets.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase refers to the historical persecution and martyrdom of God's prophets by the people of Israel. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah faced opposition and violence for delivering God's messages. The religious leaders' claim is undermined by their own actions against Jesus, who is the fulfillment of the prophetic tradition.

It was simply an instance of the unconscious hypocrisy of which every generation has more or less been guilty, when it has condemned the wrong-doing of the past--its bigotry, or luxury, or greed--and then has yielded to the same sins itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And say.</span> They boasted that they were better than their fathers; they disavowed their crimes, and endeavoured, by honouring the prophets' graves, to deliver themselves from the guilt of those who persecuted them. Fair show, with no reality! They professed to venerate the dead, but would not receive the living; they reverenced Abraham and Moses, but were about to murder the Christ to whom patriarch and prophet bore witness. Commentators quote the old adage, herein exemplified, "Sit licet divus, dummodo non vivus." The only practical way of delivering themselves from the guilt of their forefathers was by hearkening to those who now preached the gospel of salvation - the very last thing which they were purposed to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you say,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(legete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
