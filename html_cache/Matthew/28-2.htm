Earthquakes in biblical times were seen as manifestations of God's activity (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). This particular earthquake marks the momentous event of Jesus' resurrection, emphasizing its significance. The suddenness of the earthquake underscores the unexpected and miraculous nature of the resurrection.<p><b>for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven</b><br>Angels are messengers of God, often appearing at pivotal moments in biblical history. The descent of the angel from heaven highlights the divine origin of the message and action taking place. This angelic appearance is reminiscent of other significant biblical events where angels played crucial roles, such as the announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-14</a>) and the angelic assistance to Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>).<p><b>rolled away the stone</b><br>The rolling away of the stone is a physical act that symbolizes the removal of barriers between humanity and God. The stone, which sealed the tomb, represents death and finality. By rolling it away, the angel demonstrates that Jesus has conquered death. This act fulfills Jesus' prophecy of His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>) and signifies the opening of the way to eternal life for believers.<p><b>and sat on it</b><br>The angel sitting on the stone signifies triumph and authority. In ancient times, sitting was a posture of rest and dominion, indicating that the work was completed. The angel's position on the stone serves as a visual testament to the victory over death and the grave. It also reassures the witnesses of the resurrection's reality and the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God, often appearing in significant biblical events to deliver messages or perform acts of power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_earthquake.htm">The Great Earthquake</a></b><br>A supernatural event marking the resurrection of Jesus, symbolizing God's power and the monumental nature of the resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>A large stone that sealed the tomb of Jesus, representing the barrier between death and life, which the angel rolled away.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The burial place of Jesus, located in a garden near the site of the crucifixion, symbolizing both death and the new life brought by the resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God and His angels, from where the angel descended, indicating divine intervention in human history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>The angel's descent and the earthquake highlight God's direct involvement in the resurrection, reminding us that God is actively working in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_over_death.htm">Victory Over Death</a></b><br>The rolling away of the stone signifies the removal of the barrier of death, encouraging believers to live in the victory of Christ's resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_power.htm">Faith in God's Power</a></b><br>Just as the stone was rolled away, God can remove obstacles in our lives, calling us to trust in His power and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_resurrection.htm">Witness to the Resurrection</a></b><br>The angel sitting on the stone serves as a witness to the resurrection, urging us to be witnesses of Christ's victory in our own lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_28_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 28:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matthew_28_2_boost_your_faith.htm">How does the angel's appearance in Matthew 28:2 strengthen your faith today?

This was the answer to the question they had been asking as they came, "Who shall roll away the stone for us?" (<a href="/mark/16-3.htm" title="And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?">Mark 16:3</a>). That would have been beyond their strength.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> A wonderful sight met their eyes. The following event took place before their arrival; they saw only the result. No mortal eye beheld, and no pen has recorded, the actual issuing of the Lord from the closed tomb. <span class="cmt_word">There was a great earthquake.</span> St. Matthew does not attempt to give the exact sequence of events. Probably the shock, caused by the sudden advent and action of the angel, befell as the women were approaching the cemetery. Christ had risen before this occurrence, nothing being a barrier to his spiritual body. <span class="cmt_word">For the angel of the Lord... from the door.</span> The narrator accounts for the phenomenon just mentioned. The words, "from the door," are omitted by the best manuscripts, the Vulgate, and modern editors, and seem to be a marginal interpolation. The angel rolled away the stone which Joseph had rolled up (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>), not in order to afford passage to the body of the Lord, who had already raised himself, but to give the women and others entrance to the empty tomb, and to strike terror into the heart of the soldiers. In the case of Lazarus the stone had to be removed to give exit to the resuscitated body - a natural body (<a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39, 41</a>); in the case of Jesus such removal was not necessary, as his was a spiritual body, possessed of supernatural powers and qualities (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sat upon it</span>. In triumph, and to show that it was not to be replaced; death had done its work, and now was vanquished. Angels' appearances had always accompanied the great events in the history of the chosen people; angels had shown themselves at Christ's birth, at his temptation, at his agony; now they guard his tomb, proving that he was well pleasing unto the Lord, and was raised from the grave by him. The narration of this awful incident was probably given by the soldiers, who alone witnessed it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Suddenly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
