Sitting was a common position for guards who were tasked with overseeing prisoners or important events. It reflects their role in maintaining order and ensuring that the crucifixion proceeded without interruption. In the Roman military, sitting was also a position of readiness, indicating that they were prepared to respond to any disturbances.<p><b>they kept watch over Him</b><br>The soldiers were tasked with guarding Jesus to prevent any attempts at rescue or interference. This was a standard procedure during Roman executions to ensure that the sentence was carried out without any disruptions. The act of keeping watch also fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, where it is written, "They look and stare at me." This vigilance underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering and the meticulous attention to detail in the crucifixion narrative.<p><b>there.</b><br>The location of "there" refers to Golgotha, the place of the Skull, where Jesus was crucified. This site, outside the city walls of Jerusalem, was a known execution site, chosen for its visibility to passersby as a deterrent against crime. The geographical setting is significant as it aligns with the Jewish custom of executing criminals outside the city, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>. The location also holds typological significance, as it parallels the scapegoat ritual in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the sins of the people were symbolically placed on a goat and sent outside the camp, prefiguring Christ bearing the sins of humanity outside the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>These were the individuals tasked with executing Jesus and ensuring that the crucifixion was carried out according to Roman law.

Crucifixion was not accompanied by immediate death. It was one of its greatest horrors that the tortured sufferer sometimes lived for days before death relieved him from his agony. Till this supervened, the guard had to keep watch. That this caution was not superfluous, we have intimations in ancient history, which tells of crucified persons being sometimes removed by their friends and restored to the use of their limbs and faculties. Josephus ('Vita,' 75) relates that he thus took down three criminals after a lengthened suspension, one of whom completely recovered, though the others succumbed to their injuries. This vigilance of the soldiers was providentially ordered as one of the means of proving the reality of Christ's death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">sitting down,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#275;menoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2521.htm">Strong's 2521: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit, be seated, enthroned; I dwell, reside.
