The number four thousand indicates a significant crowd, emphasizing the magnitude of the miracle. In biblical numerology, the number four often symbolizes universality or completeness, suggesting the comprehensive nature of Jesus' ministry. This event took place in the region of the Decapolis, a predominantly Gentile area, indicating the extension of Jesus' ministry beyond the Jewish people. The feeding of the multitude is reminiscent of God's provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), showcasing Jesus as the provider and sustainer, fulfilling the role of the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>besides women and children</b><br>This detail underscores the cultural context of the time, where men were often counted separately in public gatherings. The inclusion of women and children, though not numerically specified, suggests that the actual number of people fed was significantly higher, possibly reaching ten to fifteen thousand. This inclusion highlights the comprehensive nature of Jesus' compassion and provision, extending to all present, regardless of gender or age. It also reflects the inclusive nature of the Kingdom of God, where all are invited to partake in the blessings of Christ. This mirrors the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where a feast is prepared for all peoples, symbolizing the universal reach of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this event, performing the miracle of feeding the multitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who assist in distributing the food to the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Comprising four thousand men, plus women and children, who have gathered to hear Jesus and are miraculously fed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of this event, symbolizing a place of need and divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>God provides abundantly for our needs, often in unexpected ways.

Matthew singles out the final head-count to emphasize that this miracle is not hearsay but a concrete, countable event (cf. <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a> for the evangelists&#8217; concern for certainty).<p>&#8226; The wording recalls earlier summaries such as &#8220;those who ate were about five thousand men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>), inviting us to compare the two feedings and see that God&#8217;s provision is not a one-time show but a repeated reality (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The stress on an actual total underscores Jesus&#8217; mastery over real-world scarcity, echoing <a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a> where Elisha feeds a crowd with limited bread.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of four thousand</b><p>&#8226; The specific number rules out exaggeration and confirms that the miracle was large-scale, yet distinct from the previous five-thousand episode&#8212;showing that Jesus&#8217; power is not limited by numbers (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/8-9.htm">Mark 8:9</a> confirms the same figure, reinforcing the historic reliability of the event.<p>&#8226; The reduced crowd (compared with the five thousand) hints that Jesus cares equally for smaller groups, illustrating the shepherd&#8217;s heart in <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>men were fed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fed&#8221; points to full satisfaction, as verse 37 states, &#8220;They all ate and were satisfied&#8221;, mirroring <a href="/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a>: &#8220;For He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Mentioning &#8220;men&#8221; first follows the cultural counting practice of the day (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>) but also sets up the next phrase that widens the circle, showing that the miracle&#8217;s reach exceeds the initial tally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>besides women and children</b><p>&#8226; By adding this qualifier Matthew silently multiplies the magnitude&#8212;families were present, likely doubling or tripling the crowd (cf. <a href="/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a> where children are again highlighted in Jesus&#8217; ministry).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores Christ&#8217;s inclusive compassion; no one is left out, anticipating <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> where all are one in Christ Jesus.<p>&#8226; It also speaks to household blessing: when the head of a family encounters Jesus, the whole household benefits (<a href="/acts/16-34.htm">Acts 16:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/15-38.htm">Matthew 15:38</a> records a real, measurable miracle in which Jesus abundantly fed thousands. The precise total, the four-thousand figure, the satisfaction of the men, and the inclusion of women and children together proclaim that Christ&#8217;s provision is accurate, ample, and all-embracing. The verse assures believers that the same Savior who met tangible needs then is ready and able to meet ours today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - The computation is made in the same way as in <a href="/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>, the greatness of the miracle being thus enhanced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A total of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
