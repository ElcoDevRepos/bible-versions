Pilate's role as governor included maintaining law and order and overseeing legal proceedings. The Jewish leaders had brought Jesus to Pilate because they lacked the authority to execute Him, seeking a Roman sentence of death. This moment fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening His mouth in defense.<p><b>who questioned Him: &#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</b><br>Pilate's question addresses the charge of treason against Jesus, as claiming to be a king could be seen as a threat to Roman authority. The title "King of the Jews" is significant because it acknowledges Jesus' messianic role, which was expected by the Jewish people. This question also highlights the political tension between Roman rule and Jewish expectations of a Messiah who would liberate them.<p><b>&#8220;You have said so,&#8221; Jesus replied.</b><br>Jesus' response is both an affirmation and a subtle deflection. By saying "You have said so," He acknowledges the truth of the statement without directly claiming the title in a way that could be misconstrued as a political threat. This response is consistent with Jesus' earlier teachings about His kingdom not being of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's humble and non-confrontational approach, such as in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, where the King comes gentle and riding on a donkey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the Messiah.

The verse showcases prophecy fulfilled, the collision of earthly and heavenly authority, and the faithful witness of Christ, who, though judged by men, reigns eternally as the rightful King of the Jews and of all creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And Jesus stood before the governor.</span>--We may infer from the greater fulness with which St. John relates what passed between our Lord and Pilate, that here, too, his acquaintance with the high priest gave him access to knowledge which others did not possess. We learn from him (1) that in his first conversation with the accusers, Pilate endeavoured to throw the <span class= "ital">onus</span> of judging upon them, and was met by the ostentatious disavowal of any power to execute judgment (<a href="/context/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28-32</a>); (2) that the single question which St. Matthew records was followed by a conversation in which our Lord declared that, though He was a King, it was not after the manner of the kingdoms of the world (<a href="/context/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?">John 18:33-38</a>). The impression thus made on the mind of the Governor explains the desire which he felt to effect, in some way or other, the release of the accused.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus examined by Pilate.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-2.htm">Mark 15:2-5</a>; <a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2-5</a>; <a href="/john/18-29.htm">John 18:29-38</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus stood before the governor.</span> St. Matthew omits here many details which the other evangelists, and especially St. John, supply. Pilate from the first had shown much reluctance to proceed, not being satisfied with the vague accusation that Jesus was a malefactor, and proposing that the Sanhedrists should try him according to Jewish Law, as if the question was merely a religious one. This treatment forced the priests to formulate a charge of which the roman authorities must take cognizance. They therefore stated unblushingly that Jesus had said that he was himself Christ a King (<a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). At this point St. Matthew's account steps in. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the King of the Jews?</span> This examination took place within the Praetorium, where Christ was detained in the custody of some guards. The accusation of the Jews had been made outside, as they had scruples about entering the building. Jesus had never actually (so far as recorded) called himself King, though the appellation had been applied to him by Nathanael (<a href="/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), and the hosannahs of the multitudes had virtually so greeted him. His accusers had added the charge that he perverted the nation, and forbade to give tribute to Caesar. There is scorn and surprise, mingled with some awe, in Pilate's interrogation, "Thou - such a one as thou - art the King of the Jews?" <span class="cmt_word">Thou sayest.</span> What thou sayest is true. A strong affirmation. Christ accepts in its fullest sense that which the governor puts as a question (comp. <a href="/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25, 64</a>).
