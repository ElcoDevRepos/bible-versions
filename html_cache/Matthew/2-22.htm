Herod the Great was known for his tyrannical rule and the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>). Archelaus inherited his father's kingdom but was known for his cruelty and incompetence, which eventually led to his removal by the Romans. This historical context explains Joseph's fear, as Archelaus's reputation was well-known. The political instability in Judea under Archelaus contrasts with the relative peace in Galilee, where Herod Antipas ruled. This situation fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>), as Joseph's decision to avoid Judea led them to settle in Nazareth.<p><b>he was afraid to go there</b><br>Joseph's fear is a natural human response to the threat posed by Archelaus. This fear is significant as it shows Joseph's protective nature over his family, particularly Jesus. It also highlights the ongoing danger to Jesus' life, even after Herod the Great's death. The fear of returning to Judea underscores the fulfillment of God's plan, as it directs the Holy Family to Galilee, aligning with the divine purpose and prophetic fulfillment.<p><b>And having been warned in a dream</b><br>Divine guidance through dreams is a recurring theme in the early chapters of Matthew. Joseph previously received dreams instructing him to take Mary as his wife (<a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>) and to flee to Egypt (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>). This method of communication emphasizes God's direct involvement and protection over Jesus' life. Dreams in the biblical context often signify important revelations or instructions from God, ensuring that His will is accomplished despite human fears and political threats.<p><b>he withdrew to the district of Galilee</b><br>Galilee, a region north of Judea, was under the rule of Herod Antipas, who was considered less threatening than Archelaus. This move to Galilee fulfills the prophecy that Jesus would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). Galilee's significance in Jesus' life and ministry is profound, as it becomes the primary setting for much of His teaching and miracles. The region's mixed population of Jews and Gentiles also foreshadows the universal scope of Jesus' mission. The withdrawal to Galilee highlights God's providential care and the unfolding of His redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/archelaus.htm">Archelaus</a></b><br>The son of Herod the Great, who ruled over Judea, Samaria, and Idumea after his father's death.

Antipas had Galilee and Peraea, Philip the region of Trachonitis. Popularly, however, the higher title was still used of him as we find it in 14:9 of the Tetrarch Antipas. The character of Archelaus was as cruel and treacherous as that of his father, and within a few months after his accession, he sent in his horsemen to disperse a multitude, and slew not less than 3,000 men. The temper of Antipas on the other hand was as yet looked on as milder. This, and possibly his absence from Galilee on a visit to Rome, may well have led Joseph to turn to that region as offering a prospect of greater safety (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). Nine years later the oppression of Archelaus became so intolerable that both Jews and Samaritans complained of him to the Emperor, and he was deposed and banished to Gaul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when he heard that Archelaus</span>. Until his murder five days before Herod's own death in the spring of A.U.C. 750, Antipater, Herod's eldest son, might naturally have been regarded as the successor, though in fact Antipas had been named as such in the will. But after Antipater's death Herod altered his will; and appointing Antipas Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, and Philip Tetrarch of Gaulonitis, Traehonitis, and Paneas, he granted the kingdom to Archelaus. Further, even after Herod's death, the succession was far from certain until the consent of Augustus had been obtained, and this, in fact, was jeopardized by Archelaus's massacre of three thousand cf those who, on his accession, called for justice on the agents of the barbarities of the late reign. Eventually, however, Herod's last arrangement was practically confirmed by Augustus, save that he expressly gave Archelaus, who had hastened to Rome, but half of his father's dominion, and appointed him only ethnarch, promising to make him king "if he governed that part virtuously" (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 17:08. 1; 11. 4; cf. 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:33. 8; 2:7. 3). Joseph's fear of Archelaus quite corresponds to the character given of him by the Jewish ambassadors before Augustus. "He seemed to be afraid lest he should not be deemed Herod's own son; and so, without any delay, he immediately Jet the nation understand his meaning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the slaughter of the three thousand malcontents above referred to (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 17:11.2). He was in A.D. deposed for his cruelty, and banished to Vienne, in Gaul. <span class="cmt_word">Did reign</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">was reigning</span>; an attempt to express the vivid present of the original, which recalls the very words he heard. After Augustus's decision, Archelaus could not legally have called himself <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, but the title, especially as implied in the verb, would have been customary in popular speech (cf. <a href="/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>). But it is possible that the expression was used before Archelaus went to Rome, and at the time of his first grasp of power under Herod's will. <span class="cmt_word">In Judaea</span>. The Revised Version ( <span class="accented">over Judaea</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) rightly implies not only that he lived in Judaea, but that, unlike his father, was not king of the whole of Palestine, but emphatically of Judaea. To this Idumaea and Samaria were appendages. <span class="cmt_word">In the room of his father Herod</span>.
