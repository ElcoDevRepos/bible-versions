It was considered the dwelling place of God on earth, making any oath taken by it extremely serious. Swearing by the temple was a common practice among the Jews, reflecting the temple's sacred status. This phrase highlights the importance of understanding the gravity of oaths and the reverence due to holy places.<p><b>swears by it and by the One who dwells in it.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that swearing by the temple is not just about the physical structure but also involves invoking the presence of God, who is believed to dwell within it. The "One who dwells in it" refers to God Himself, underscoring the belief that God's presence sanctifies the temple. This reflects the Old Testament understanding of God's presence in the temple, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>, where Solomon acknowledges God's dwelling in the temple. The phrase serves as a reminder of the seriousness of invoking God's name and presence in oaths, aligning with the broader biblical teaching on the sanctity of vows and the importance of truthfulness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the scribes and Pharisees, highlighting their hypocrisy and misunderstanding of the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>A central place of worship for the Jews in Jerusalem, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_dwells_in_the_temple.htm">The One who dwells in the Temple</a></b><br>Refers to God Himself, emphasizing His holiness and the sacredness of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders known for their strict adherence to the law but criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Temple is located, a significant place in Jewish religious life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god's_dwelling.htm">The Holiness of God&#8217;s Dwelling</a></b><br>Recognize the sacredness of places dedicated to God and approach them with reverence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_speech.htm">Integrity in Speech</a></b><br>Let your "yes" be "yes" and your "no" be "no."

The moment they used the temple in an oath, they placed their word under divine scrutiny (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; By tightening the logic, Christ upholds the integrity of truthful speech, echoing His earlier call, &#8220;Let your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and your &#8216;No,&#8217; &#8216;No&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>; <a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and by the One who dwells in it</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence filled the temple when Solomon dedicated it (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;13</a>). Even after the exile, the promise remained: &#8220;My Name will be there forever&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-16.htm">2 Chronicles 7:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore any oath &#8220;by the temple&#8221; unavoidably invokes the living God who dwells there. Jesus underlines that truth, erasing any loophole the religious leaders imagined (<a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48&#8211;49</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s point is simple: every word we offer before men is heard before God (<a href="/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Honesty is not optional; it is an act of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/23-21.htm">Matthew 23:21</a> exposes the folly of treating oaths as technicalities. When someone &#8220;swears by the temple,&#8221; he is really swearing by the God who inhabits it. Jesus insists that all speech is sacred, all promises accountable, because God indwells His holy dwelling and hears every word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By him that dwelleth therein.</span> In fact, it comes to this: to swear by temple or altar is to swear by God - an oath most solemn, which may not be evaded. "That dwelleth" is in some manuscripts the aorist participle, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, implying that God once for all took up his abode in the temple, and filled it with his ineffable presence (see <a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-14.htm">Psalm 132:14</a>). From such passages we learn that God sanctifies things and places to be devoted to his service, and to be accounted by men holy and separated from all common uses. The Authorized Version translates the received text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which has good authority, the past participle being, perhaps, a correction by some scribe who thought that the day of Judaism was past when Christ spoke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
