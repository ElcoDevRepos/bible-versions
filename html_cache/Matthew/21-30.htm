The "second son" represents those who outwardly profess obedience to God but fail to follow through with action. This reflects the religious leaders of Jesus' time, who claimed to uphold God's law but often neglected its true spirit. The repetition of the father's request emphasizes God's consistent and patient call to all His children, regardless of their initial response.<p><b>&#8216;I will, sir,&#8217; he said.</b><br>The second son's response is respectful and appears obedient, addressing his father as "sir," which indicates a recognition of authority. This mirrors the behavior of those who honor God with their lips but whose hearts are far from Him, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>. The son&#8217;s verbal commitment contrasts with his subsequent actions, highlighting the theme of hypocrisy and the importance of genuine obedience over mere words.<p><b>But he did not go.</b><br>This phrase underscores the central message of the parable: the discrepancy between words and actions. The second son's failure to act on his promise serves as a warning against empty professions of faith. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reinforces this idea, stating that faith without works is dead. The parable challenges believers to examine their own lives for consistency between their declarations of faith and their deeds. It also serves as a call to repentance and true obedience, aligning one's actions with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, who calls His children to work in His vineyard, symbolizing His kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_son.htm">The Second Son</a></b><br>Represents those who verbally commit to God's will but fail to follow through with action.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes the kingdom of God and the work He calls His followers to do.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_first_son.htm">The First Son (from the previous verse)</a></b><br>Represents those who initially resist God's call but ultimately obey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_audience.htm">Jesus' Audience</a></b><br>Primarily the chief priests and elders of the people, whom Jesus addresses in this parable to illustrate their failure to act on their professed beliefs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_action_over_words.htm">The Importance of Action Over Words</a></b><br>True obedience to God is demonstrated through actions, not just verbal commitments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Believers should regularly assess whether their actions align with their professed faith and commitments to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_change.htm">Repentance and Change</a></b><br>Like the first son, there is always an opportunity to repent and align actions with God's will, even after initial resistance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authentic_faith.htm">Authentic Faith</a></b><br>Authentic faith is characterized by a willingness to follow through on commitments to God, reflecting a heart transformed by His grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_in_community.htm">Accountability in Community</a></b><br>Encourage accountability within the Christian community to support one another in living out commitments to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_21_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 21:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_30_Rethink_God_s_obedience.htm">How does Matthew 21:30 challenge our understanding of obedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Second_son_s_response_on_true_repentance.htm">What does the second son's response teach about true repentance and action?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_21_30_in_daily_choices.htm">How can we apply the lesson of Matthew 21:30 in daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Sons_actions_vs_James_1_22_Doers.htm">Compare the sons' actions to James 1:22 about being doers of the word.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_actions_with_God_s_will_70.htm">In what ways can we ensure our actions align with our commitments to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_the_second_son_change_his_mind.htm">What is the significance of the second son's change of mind in Matthew 21:30?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_30_s_take_on_faith_obedience.htm">How does Matthew 21:30 challenge the concept of obedience in faith?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Purpose_of_Jesus_two_sons_parable.htm">Why does Jesus use the parable of the two sons in Matthew 21:30?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/biblical_end_times_predictions.htm">What are the predictions for the biblical end times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/which_son_obeyed_his_father.htm">Which son truly obeyed his father's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_call_jesus_'son_of_david'_in_matt_21_9.htm">Why do the crowds in Matthew 21:9 publicly proclaim Jesus as the 'Son of David' if secular records are silent about this event?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_olivet_discourse_about.htm">What is the Olivet Discourse about?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 21:30 Mean</div><b>Then the man went to the second son</b><p>&#8226; Jesus has just spoken of a first son who refused, then repented (v. 29).
