John was a significant prophetic figure, preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3:1-3</a>). His death marked a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, highlighting the growing opposition to the message of repentance and the kingdom of God. John's martyrdom foreshadows the suffering and sacrifice Jesus Himself would endure.<p><b>He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place</b><br>Jesus' withdrawal signifies a moment of reflection and mourning for John, His relative and forerunner. The solitary place, likely near the Sea of Galilee, provided a setting for prayer and communion with the Father. This action also demonstrates Jesus' humanity, needing time away from the crowds. The Sea of Galilee, a central location in Jesus' ministry, was surrounded by hills and secluded areas ideal for solitude.<p><b>But the crowds found out about it</b><br>Despite Jesus' intention for privacy, His growing popularity made it difficult to remain unnoticed. The crowds' determination to seek Him reflects their desperation for healing and teaching. This pursuit underscores the widespread impact of Jesus' ministry and the people's recognition of His authority and compassion.<p><b>and followed Him on foot from the towns</b><br>The crowds' willingness to travel on foot from various towns indicates their eagerness and faith in Jesus' power to heal and teach.

The verse encourages us to mourn rightly, guard time with the Father, and yet keep hearts open to God-given interruptions, trusting that in every season&#8212;sorrow, rest, or busy ministry&#8212;our Lord is present and sufficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">When Jesus heard of it.</span>--We may, I think reverently trace as the motives of this withdrawal, (1) the strong personal emotion which the death of one whom Jesus had known and loved could not fail to cause, and (2) the wish to avoid being the centre of the popular excitement which the death of John was likely to cause, and which we know, as a matter of fact (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 5, ? 2), was so strong that men looked on all the subsequent troubles of Antipas and his wife as a retributive judgment for it. This was, indeed, sufficiently shown by the eagerness with which the people followed Him into His retirement. Two other circumstances, named by the other Evangelists, tended to increase the crowd that thronged around Him. (1) The Twelve had just returned from their missionary circuit (<a href="/context/mark/6-30.htm" title="And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.">Mark 6:30-31</a>; <a href="/luke/9-10.htm" title="And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.">Luke 9:10</a>), and it was, indeed, partly to give them, too, an interval of repose that He thus withdrew from His public work; and (2) the Passover was coming on (<a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>), and all the roads of Galilee were thronged with companies of pilgrims hastening to keep the feast at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Into a desert place.</span>--St. Luke names this as "a city called Bethsaida," i.e., one of the two towns bearing that name on the coast of the Sea of Galilee. The name (which signified House of Fish=Fish-town) was a natural one for villages so placed, and the topography of all countries, our own included, presents too many instances of two or more places bearing the same name. with some distinctive epithet, to make the fact at all strange here. In St. Mark's account the disciples sail, after the feeding of the five thousand, to the other Bethsaida (<a href="/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>); and as this appears in <a href="/john/6-17.htm" title="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.">John 6:17</a> to have been in the direction of Capernaum, the scene of the miracle must have been Bethsaida-Julias. on the north-east shore of the lake. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-21.</span> - <span class="accented">The feeding of the five thousand.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/6-30.htm">Mark 6:30-44</a>; <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>; <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1-13</a>. The miracle was deemed so characteristic of our Lord's work, in his care for men and his power to sustain them, and more especially in its being a parable of his readiness to supply spiritual food, that it was recorded not only by each of the three evangelists who used the framework, but also by the one who depended entirely upon his own materials. But though St. John's account of it is on the whole independent, yet even this has expressions which are certainly due to the influence of the source used by the synoptists, or, less probably, of one or other of our present Gospels.
