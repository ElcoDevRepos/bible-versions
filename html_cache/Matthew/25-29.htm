In the context of the Parable of the Talents, it highlights the reward for those who wisely use what they have been entrusted with. Biblically, this reflects the idea that God blesses those who are faithful with their gifts and responsibilities (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). Theologically, it underscores the concept of divine justice and grace, where faithfulness leads to greater blessings. This principle is also seen in the Old Testament, where obedience to God often resulted in increased blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<p><b>and he will have an abundance</b><br>The promise of abundance is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with God's provision and blessing. In the cultural context of the time, abundance was seen as a sign of divine favor. This phrase can be connected to the idea of spiritual abundance, where those who are faithful in small things are entrusted with greater spiritual responsibilities and rewards (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). It also reflects the eschatological hope of eternal life and the fullness of joy in God's presence.<p><b>But the one who does not have</b><br>This phrase introduces a contrast and serves as a warning. It reflects the biblical principle that neglect or misuse of what one has been given leads to loss. In the historical context, this would resonate with the audience familiar with the consequences of poor stewardship. Spiritually, it warns against complacency and the failure to act on one's faith (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>). It also echoes the warnings found in the prophets about the consequences of unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/5-19.htm">Jeremiah 5:19</a>).<p><b>even what he has will be taken away from him</b><br>This concluding phrase underscores the seriousness of the warning. It reflects the justice of God, where neglect leads to loss, not just of potential rewards but of what one already possesses. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). In the broader biblical narrative, it serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and faithfulness in one's spiritual life, echoing the warnings given to the churches in Revelation (Revelation 2-3).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the Kingdom of Heaven and the importance of being faithful stewards of what God has entrusted to them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to understand and apply His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_of_the_talents.htm">The Parable of the Talents</a></b><br>The context of this verse, where Jesus uses a account about a master and his servants to illustrate the principles of stewardship and accountability.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God, who entrusts His servants with resources and expects them to be fruitful.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize believers who are given different amounts of resources and opportunities to serve God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>Believers are called to be diligent and responsible with the gifts, talents, and resources God has entrusted to them.

Our present choices regarding Christ&#8217;s resources shape both earthly fruitfulness and eternal destiny.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Unto every one that hath.</span>--The meaning and practical working of the law thus stated have been sufficiently illustrated in the Note on <a href="/matthew/25-28.htm" title="Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which has ten talents.">Matthew 25:28</a>. What is noteworthy here is the extreme generality with which the law is stated. Analogies of that law are, it need even scarcely be said, to be found both in nature and in human society. Non-user tends to invalidate legal right. A muscle that is not exercised tends to degenerate and lose its power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto every one that hath... abundance</span> (<a href="/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>). So we have seen in the first part of the parable. The proverb says, "Money makes money;" a man who has capital finds various means of increasing it; it grows as it is judiciously employed. Thus the grace of God, duly stirred up and exercised, receives continual accession, "grace for grace" (<a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>). The Christian's spiritual forces are developed by being properly directed; Providence puts in his way added opportunities, and as he uses these he is more and more strengthened and replenished. <span class="cmt_word">From him that hath not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). So the Received Text, probably from <a href="/luke/19-26.htm">Luke 19:26</a>; the best manuscripts and editions read, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">but as to him that hath nat</span>; this, followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> at the end of the verse, is less tautological than the other reading. To "have not," in accordance with the context, signifies to possess nothing of any consequence, to be comparatively destitute, in the world's estimate of riches. Shall be taken away even that which he hath; <span class="accented">even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.</span> The Vulgate, following some few manuscripts, has, <span class="accented">Et quod videtur habere auferetur ab eo</span>, from <a href="/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a>. The poor unpractical man shall lose even the little which he possessed. So the spiritually unprofitable shall be punished by utter deprivation of the grace which was given for his advancement in holiness. If applied to the special circumstances of the time and of the persons to whom it was addressed, the parable would teach that the disciples who recognized and duly employed the riches of the doctrine and powers delivered unto them would receive further revelations; but that the people who spurned the offered salvation and neglected the gracious opportunity would forfeit the blessing, and be condemned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
