The crowd likely consisted of mourners and onlookers, common in Jewish culture during times of death, who were creating a commotion. By putting them outside, Jesus creates an environment of faith and intimacy, free from doubt and disbelief. This act can be seen as a parallel to the need for spiritual separation from unbelief to witness God's power. It also reflects the practice of creating a sacred space for divine intervention.<p><b>Jesus went in</b><br>Jesus' entry into the room signifies His willingness to engage personally and directly with those in need. This action is consistent with His ministry, where He often sought out individuals to heal and restore. It highlights His compassion and readiness to confront death, a theme that runs throughout the Gospels. This moment foreshadows His ultimate victory over death through His resurrection.<p><b>and took the girl by the hand</b><br>The act of taking the girl by the hand is significant both culturally and theologically. In Jewish tradition, touching a dead body would render someone ceremonially unclean, yet Jesus transcends these laws, demonstrating His purity and authority over life and death. This gesture of touch is a recurring theme in Jesus' healings, symbolizing His personal connection and the transfer of divine power. It also reflects the intimacy and care of Jesus, who is often depicted as the Good Shepherd tending to His flock.<p><b>and she got up</b><br>The girl's rising is a testament to Jesus' power over death and His role as the giver of life. This miracle prefigures the resurrection, both of Jesus Himself and the future resurrection of believers. It serves as a sign of the Kingdom of God breaking into the present world, where death is defeated. This event is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies that speak of the Messiah's power to bring life and restoration, such as in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, which speaks of the dead living again. The miracle reinforces the theme of faith, as it is the faith of the girl's father that initiates this divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion by raising the girl from the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_girl.htm">The Girl</a></b><br>- The daughter of a synagogue leader, who had died and was brought back to life by Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- The people who were mourning the girl's death, whom Jesus asked to leave before performing the miracle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue_leader.htm">The Synagogue Leader (Jairus)</a></b><br>- Although not named in this verse, other Gospel accounts identify him as Jairus, who sought Jesus' help for his dying daughter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>- The location where the miracle took place, symbolizing a place of transformation and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Jesus' response to Jairus' faith reminds us that faith often requires action, such as seeking Jesus earnestly in times of need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_over_death.htm">Divine Authority Over Death</a></b><br>This miracle underscores Jesus' authority over life and death, affirming His divine nature and offering hope in the promise of eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_presence.htm">The Power of Jesus' Presence</a></b><br>The removal of the crowd signifies the importance of creating an environment of faith and expectation for God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassionate_savior.htm">Compassionate Savior</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to respond to Jairus' plea and His gentle act of taking the girl's hand reflect His compassion and personal care for individuals.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_christ.htm">Transformation Through Christ</a></b><br>Just as the girl's life was restored, believers are reminded of the transformative power of Christ in their own lives, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_9_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_25_Jesus_power_over_death.htm">How does Matthew 9:25 demonstrate Jesus' authority over life and death?

Their wailing reflected hopelessness; Jesus dismissed them because unbelief has no place in a room where resurrection power is about to work (<a href="/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Elisha shut the door before raising the Shunammite&#8217;s son (<a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32&#8211;33</a>), Jesus removes distraction so faith can focus on Him alone.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s action highlights a principle: God often works most powerfully when the noise of skepticism is silenced (<a href="/luke/8-51.htm">Luke 8:51</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand</b><p>&#8226; Entering the room, Jesus approaches death without hesitation.
