The term "rebuke" is strong, often used in the context of correcting or admonishing someone. This reflects Peter's misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of His messianic role. In Jewish culture, a disciple rebuking a rabbi would be highly unusual, highlighting Peter's emotional response and his struggle to accept Jesus' prediction of His suffering and death. This moment underscores the tension between human expectations of the Messiah as a political liberator and the divine plan of redemption through suffering.<p><b>&#8220;Far be it from You, Lord!&#8221; he said.</b><br>Peter's exclamation, "Far be it from You, Lord!" reveals his deep affection and loyalty to Jesus, as well as his inability to comprehend the necessity of Jesus' suffering. The phrase reflects a common Jewish expression of denial or rejection of a negative outcome. Peter's use of "Lord" acknowledges Jesus' authority, yet his words show a lack of understanding of Jesus' mission. This moment is reminiscent of other instances where God's plans are initially misunderstood by His followers, such as when Abraham struggled to understand God's promise of a son in his old age (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17-18</a>).<p><b>&#8220;This shall never happen to You!&#8221;</b><br>Peter's declaration, "This shall never happen to You!" is a direct contradiction to Jesus' prophecy of His suffering, death, and resurrection. This reflects a common human tendency to resist difficult truths, especially those involving suffering or sacrifice. Peter's reaction is rooted in the Jewish expectation of a triumphant Messiah who would deliver Israel from Roman oppression, not one who would suffer and die. This statement also foreshadows Peter's later denial of Jesus during His trial (<a href="/matthew/26-69.htm">Matthew 26:69-75</a>), highlighting the ongoing struggle between faith and fear. Theologically, this moment emphasizes the necessity of Jesus' sacrificial death as part of God's redemptive plan, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong leadership among the apostles.

That intimacy emboldens him.<p>&#8226; Private correction: Moving off to the side suggests Peter thinks Jesus needs one-on-one counsel.

Now Peter slips from divinely inspired spokesman to human critic, illustrating how easily a believer can shift from spiritual clarity to fleshly reasoning (<a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus had just predicted His suffering and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). Instead of embracing that revelation, Peter objects, echoing the disciples&#8217; confusion in <a href="/luke/18-34.htm">Luke 18:34</a> where &#8220;they did not understand any of these things.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Far be it from You, Lord!" he said</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Far be it from You, Lord!&#8217; he said&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase expresses horror&#8212;&#8220;May God be merciful to you; spare yourself.&#8221; Peter&#8217;s heart recoils at a suffering Messiah, even though <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a> had long foretold it.<p>&#8226; He affirms Jesus&#8217; lordship (&#8220;Lord&#8221;) yet contradicts His words, much like the paradox in <a href="/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>&#8212;&#8220;Not so, Lord.&#8221; True submission means trusting even the hard parts of God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter loves Jesus deeply, but love divorced from truth can oppose God&#8217;s will (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-6.htm">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"This shall never happen to You!"</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;This shall never happen to You!&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Peter flatly denies the necessity of the cross, standing in direct conflict with prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16-18</a> and <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>.<p>&#8226; His words echo later actions: &#8220;Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-35.htm">Matthew 26:35</a>). Human resolve, however earnest, cannot overturn God&#8217;s sovereign plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus immediately responds, &#8220;Get behind Me, Satan!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-23.htm">Matthew 16:23</a>), exposing the spiritual danger of sentiments that deter the Savior from accomplishing redemption (<a href="/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a> captures a moment when heartfelt affection collides with divine purpose. Peter&#8217;s private pull, bold rebuke, protective plea, and absolute denial all spring from love mingled with human reasoning. Yet any attempt to shelter Jesus from suffering would have robbed the world of salvation. The verse warns believers to measure even our sincerest impulses against God&#8217;s revealed Word, trusting that His plan&#8212;no matter how startling&#8212;remains perfect, necessary, and unstoppable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</span>--It is obvious that the mind of the disciple dwelt on the former, not the latter part of the prediction. The death was plain and terrible to him, for he failed to grasp the idea of the resurrection. The remonstrance would perhaps have been natural at any time, but the contrast between this prediction and the tone of confidence and triumph in the previous promise doubtless intensified its vehemence. Personal love for his Lord, his own desire to share in the glory which that promise had implied, were united in his refusal to accept this as the issue towards which they were tending.<p><span class= "bld">Be it far from thee, Lord.</span>--The words are a paraphrase rather than a translation of the original. Literally, the words are an abbreviated prayer, "(<span class= "ital">God be</span>) merciful to Thee," the name of God, as in our colloquial "Mercy on us!" being omitted. The phrase is of frequent occurrence in the Greek version of the Old Testament, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-19.htm" title="Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.">Numbers 14:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-8.htm" title="Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to your people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.">Deuteronomy 21:8</a>. It is almost idle to attempt to trace a distinctly formulated thought in the sudden utterance of sorrow and alarm, but so far as the words go they seem of the nature of a protest against what seemed to the disciple a causeless despondency, a dark view of the future, at variance alike with his own expectations and what seemed to him the meaning of his Master's previous words. The words that followed were, however, more than a prayer, "This shall not be unto Thee," as though his power to bind and to loose extended even to the region of his Master's work and the means by which it was to be accomplished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter took him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Either taking him aside, or taking him by the hand or dress - a reverent familiarity permitted by the Lord to his loving apostle. And now this same Peter, who had just before made his noble confession, and had been rewarded with unique commendation, unable to shake off the prejudices of his age and his education, <span class="cmt_word">began to rebuke</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) his Master. He presumed to chide Jesus for speaking of suffering and death. He, the Son of God most High, what had he to do with such things? How could he name them in connection with himself? Peter, while accepting the idea of Messiah as Divine and triumphant, could not receive the notion of his death and Passion. That the same person should be so humiliated and yet so glorious, was beyond his conception. He was as much in the dark as his fellow apostles; of that which was not specially revealed to him he knew nothing. It was the carnal mind that here influenced him, not the spiritually enlightened soul. By writing "began," the historian intimates that he had not time to say much before the Lord mercifully interposed and cut him short. <span class="cmt_word">Be it far from thee;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">absit a te.</span> The Greek phrase is elliptical, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> being understood; "God be merciful to thee," equivalent to "God forbid." The complete expression occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="/1_chronicles/11-19.htm">1 Chronicles 11:19</a>. It is used in deprecation of a disastrous event. <span class="cmt_word">This shall not be unto thee;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. This is a very strong assertion, not a prayer or wish, as some would make it; the use of language is quite against that, as the phrase is predictive, never prohibitory, in his mistaken zeal and his ignorant affection, Peter would be wiser than his Lord. The cross and Passion shall never be thy lot; Messiah cannot suffer, the Son of God cannot die.
