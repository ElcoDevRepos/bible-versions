The Pharisees and Sadducees were two influential Jewish sects. The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the Law and oral traditions, while the Sadducees, often associated with the priestly class, denied the resurrection and held only to the written Law. Their presence at John's baptism suggests a curiosity or concern about his growing influence. This encounter highlights the tension between John&#8217;s call for repentance and the established religious authorities.<p><b>he said to them, &#8220;You brood of vipers</b><br>John's harsh rebuke, "brood of vipers," implies deceit and danger, likening them to snakes, which in Jewish tradition are often associated with evil and Satan (<a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>). This metaphor suggests that the religious leaders were leading people astray and were themselves in need of repentance. It reflects John's prophetic role, similar to Old Testament prophets who confronted Israel's leaders.<p><b>who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</b><br>The "coming wrath" refers to God's impending judgment, a common theme in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-15</a>). John&#8217;s question challenges the sincerity of the Pharisees and Sadducees, questioning whether their presence was genuine repentance or mere self-preservation.

(1.) THE PHARISEES. Singularly enough, the name appears for the first time in the Gospel history. Josephus, who tells us most about them, being presumably later, if not than the Gospels in their present form, yet, at all events, than the materials from which they are derived. We cannot say, therefore, when the name came first into use. They are first mentioned by the Jewish historian as opposing the government of the priest-ruler of the Asmonaean house, John Hyrcanus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xiii.</span> 5). The meaning of the name is clear enough. The Pharisees were the "separated" ones, and the meaning may help us to trace the history. The attempt of Antiochus Epiphanes (as related in the two Books of Maccabees) to blot out the distinctness of Jewish life by introducing Greek worship and Greek customs, was met with an heroic resistance by priests and people. The "mingling" or "not mingling" with the heathen in marriage or in social life became a test of religious character (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-3.htm" title="Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiled himself wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles, seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more access to the holy altar,">2 Maccabees 14:3</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-38.htm" title="For in the former times, when they mingled not themselves with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard his body and life with all vehemency for the religion of the Jews.">2 Maccabees 14:38</a>). The faithful became known as Assideans, <span class= "ital">i.e., Chasidim</span> or saints (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-42.htm" title="Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.">1 Maccabees 2:42</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-13.htm" title="Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:">1 Maccabees 7:13</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-17.htm" title="The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their blood have they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.">1 Maccabees 7:17</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-6.htm" title="Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.">2 Maccabees 14:6</a>), and looked to Judas Maccabeus as their leader. Later on, as the holding aloof from the heathen became more and more characteristic of them, they took the name of Pharisees, and under John Hyrcanus became a powerful and organised body; forming a kind of guild or fraternity as well as a party, uniting some features of the Puritan with some of the Society of the Jesuits. Like most sects and parties, they had their bright and their dark sides. They maintained the ethical side of the Law as against the sacrificial. They insisted on alms, and fasting, and prayer, as the three great elements of the religious life; on the Sabbath, as its great safe-guard. They did much to promote education and synagogue-building. In gathering the traditions of older Rabbis, they held themselves to be "setting a fence round the Law" to maintain its sacredness. They were eager in the mission-work of Judaism, and "compassed sea and land to make one proselyte" (<a href="/matthew/23-15.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.">Matthew 23:15</a>). They maintained or revived the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and of the rewards and punishments that were to follow. On the other side, their "separation" developed almost into the exclusiveness of a caste. Their casuistry inverted the right relation of moral and ceremonial duties. They despised the mass of their own countrymen as the "brute people of the earth." Within the sect there were two schools, represented at this time by the followers of Shammai and of Hillel, the former more after the pattern of the Puritan, rigid in its Sabbatarianism, hard and bitter in its spirit; the latter more after the type of the Jesuit, with wider culture, gentler temper, an easier casuistry, moral precepts of a wider kind. Of both schools it must be remembered that they were emphatically lay-religionists, unconnected with the priesthood, and often in opposition to it. (2.) THE SADDUCEES. Etymologically, the name, though connected with the Hebrew word for "righteous," must be derived from the proper name "Zadok," found in the Old Testament as belonging to the high priest in the time of Solomon. A tradition, of uncertain authority and date, states that the founder of the sect was a certain Zadok, the disciple of Antigonus, who, in his turn, had sat at the feet of Simon the Just. Antigonus taught, it was said, that "men should not be servants who do their Master's will for a reward," and the scholar developed the doctrine into a denial of the resurrection, which formed the reward. Whether this is a true account or not, the features of the Sadducees in the New Testament stand out with sufficient clearness. They are for the most part of the higher priestly order, as contrasted with the lay-scribes of the Pharisees. They admit the authority of the written Law, not of traditions. They deny the existence of angels and spirits, as well as the resurrection and the immortality of the soul. They made up for the absence of the fears of the future, by greater rigour in punishments on earth. They courted the favour of their Roman rulers, and to some extent even of the Herods. It is not easy to enter into the motives which led either of the sects to come to the baptism of John. It may be that they were carried away for a time by the enthusiasm of the people, or sought to guide the movement by controlling it, or to enlist the new teacher on this side or that. Anyhow, there was no repentance, and no confession, and so the Baptist met them with a stern reproof. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">faithful warning.</span> (Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7-9, 16, 17</a>.)

The typical Jews, considered as one class (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), in contrast to the multitudes. <span class="accented">Pharisees.</span> Their characteristic is shown in their name, "Separatists;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from anything that would hinder exact obedience to the Mosaic Law. Hence they are the strict adherents of tradition. They ultimately gained the ascendancy, and, in consequence, the standard Jewish books represent the result of their teaching, They belonged almost entirely to the middle classes. <span class="accented">Sadducees.</span> They were chiefly of the noblest, especially the high-priestly, families. Hence their first thought was political quiet, and with this they not unnaturally combined the love of Greek culture. They set the plain meaning of the Law far above all tradition, even that of the Prophets and the Hagiographa. <span class="cmt_word">Come</span> (<span class="accented">Obtains</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">to his baptism</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (omit <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). They were apparently not merely coming to see what took place, but with the purpose of receiving his baptism (cf. Thayer, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> c. 1:2, g. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;</span> <span class="accented">aa</span>.); cf. <a href="/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3b4;</span>); <a href="/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>. The marginal reading, however, proposed by the American Revisers "for baptism," does not do justice to the article. The Gospel according to the Hebrews (Resch, 'Agrapha.' p. 343) says that they were in fact baptized, but we can hardly suppose this to have been the case after John's words to them. Observe that the Pharisees, with their self-conscious sanctity, were hardly likely to come to confess their sins, or the Sadducees to even listen to so ascetic a teacher. He said unto them; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the Pharisees and Sadducees; Luke, less exactly, "to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him." There is, indeed, nothing, save the opening sentence, which refers solely to the Pharisees and Sadducees; but this fact does not show (Bleek) that the words were really spoken to all, and that Matthew's expression is wrong. John doubtless addressed the Pharisees and Sadducees primarily; but as, after all, they only formed the apex of ordinary Jewish thought, what he said to them fitted also the majority of his listeners. <span class="cmt_word">O generation</span> (<span class="accented">ye offspring</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">of vipers!</span> The simile not only expresses the thought that, behind their smooth exterior, the outward legal strictness of the Pharisees, and the worldly decorum of the Sadducees, lay hidden malice and venom, but also that this is due to their very nature. It may have directly implied that they belonged in a true sense to the seed of the serpent (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>); cf. our Lord's words (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath</span> (omitted by the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">warned you?</span> The verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) has elsewhere in the New Testament (St. Luke's writings only) no thought of warning, nor of secrecy, but of teaching, of placing the matter under the eyes of others (cf. especially <a href="/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>; <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47</a>). John is making no inquiry for information, but only utters surprise at seeing them (cf. <a href="/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). Whoever can have told you of your danger? He might have saved himself the trouble, you being what you are! Yet the very violence of his expression was such as to call their attention to the depth of their sinfulness, and after all to lead them perhaps to repentance. For this reason he adds, "Bring forth therefore." <span class="cmt_word">To flee</span>; aorist, not exactly indicating "the activity as momentary, setting forth the point of time when the wrath breaks forth, in which the flight also is realized" (Meyer), but the flight as one single action, without any reference to the time of the breaking forth of the wrath. <span class="cmt_word">From</span>. The wrath is pictured as coming on them from without. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a> St. Paul says that Jesus delivers out of (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) it, implying that he himself and all men are naturally in and under it (but see <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">The wrath to come</span>. Perhaps connected in John's mind with the wrath of the Messianic age (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3-6</a>). If so, it would find its primary fulfilment in the destruction of Jerusalem, but its complete fulfilment only in the manifestation of the wrath at the last judgment - (<a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>; cf. <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>; <a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16, 17</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>). <span class="accented">Wrath.</span> Not merely punishment. The thought is of the feeling of anger against sin in him who punishes it (cf. <a href="/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-7.htm">Matthew 22:7</a>; <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[John] saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pollous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
