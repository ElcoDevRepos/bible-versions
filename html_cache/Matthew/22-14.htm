In the context of <a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, Jesus is speaking about the parable of the wedding banquet, where many guests are invited. The "calling" refers to the general invitation to salvation extended to all humanity. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations. Historically, this reflects the Jewish understanding of being God's chosen people, yet Jesus expands this to include Gentiles, emphasizing the universal reach of God's call.<p><b>but few are chosen.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the distinction between being called and being chosen. While many hear the Gospel, only a few respond in faith and obedience, demonstrating the transformative work of God in their lives. This echoes the concept of the "remnant" found in the Old Testament, where only a faithful few remain true to God (<a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>). Theologically, this can be connected to the doctrine of election, where God, in His sovereignty, chooses individuals for salvation (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>). It also reflects the parable's context, where many invited guests refuse to attend the wedding, symbolizing those who reject God's invitation. This phrase challenges believers to examine their response to God's call and to live in a manner worthy of being chosen.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is teaching about the Kingdom of Heaven and the nature of God's invitation to humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding_feast.htm">The Wedding Feast</a></b><br>The parable preceding this verse describes a king who prepares a wedding banquet for his son, symbolizing God's invitation to His Kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, who extends the invitation to the wedding feast.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invited_guests.htm">The Invited Guests</a></b><br>Initially, these are the people of Israel who were first invited to God's Kingdom but refused to come.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chosen_few.htm">The Chosen Few</a></b><br>Those who respond to God's call and are found worthy to enter the Kingdom, symbolizing true believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_call.htm">Understanding the Call</a></b><br>The call of God is extended to many, symbolizing the universal offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.

Jesus is explaining why the king casts out the improperly dressed guest.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Many&#8221; shows the breadth of God&#8217;s invitation; it is not restricted to one nation or small circle.<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a> invites, &#8220;Come, all who are thirsty.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a> says God &#8220;wants all people to be saved.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a> echoes, &#8220;So the last will be first, and the first last.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The banquet doors are thrown open wide, underscoring God&#8217;s generous heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are called</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;call&#8221; is an earnest summons, not a casual mention. In the parable the servants went everywhere, &#8220;to as many as they found, both good and evil&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-10.htm">Matthew 22:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture pictures this call in many scenes:<p>&#8211; <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>: Jesus stands at the door and knocks.<p>&#8211; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>: &#8220;He called you to this through our gospel.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> shows wisdom calling aloud in the streets.<p>&#8226; The call is real, sincere, and demanding a response.

All who embrace the invitation discover God was already at work drawing them (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The wedding garment in the parable points to Christ&#8217;s righteousness. Those clothed in it prove they are the chosen (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus&#8217; closing line distills the entire parable: God&#8217;s kingdom invitation goes out to multitudes, yet only a remnant accept it on His terms. Many hear; comparatively few embrace the wedding garment of Christ&#8217;s righteousness and thus reveal themselves as God&#8217;s elect. The verse urges every listener to respond wholeheartedly, resting in the Savior&#8217;s grace while recognizing the sober reality that not all who are invited will finally sit at the King&#8217;s table.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Many are called.</span>--(See Note on <a href="/matthew/20-16.htm" title="So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.">Matthew 20:16</a>.) The "calling" answers, both verbally and in substance, to the "bidding" or invitation of the parable. The "chosen" are those who both accept the invitation and comply with its condition; those who, in the one parable, work in the vineyard, and in the other, array themselves with the wedding garment of holiness. The "choice," as far as the parable is concerned, appears as dependent upon the answer given to the calling. The further truth of an election "according to the foreknowledge of God the Father" (<a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2</a>) is not here within view, but it follows necessarily on the assumption of that foreknowledge. The "choice," which in the parable comes as the close of all, must be thought of as having been present to the mind of the All-knowing from all eternity. No one can fix time limits for the thoughts of God, and say that at such a time a purpose came into His mind as it comes into the minds of men. We are compelled in such matters to use anthropomorphic language, but we should remember, as we do so, its necessary limitations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many are called...chosen.</span> The rejected guest is a type of a numerous class (see <a href="/matthew/20-6.htm">Matthew 20:6</a>). All the Jews had first been called; then all the Gentiles; many were they who obeyed not the call; and of those who did come in, many were not of the inner election, of those, that is, whose life and character were worthy of the Christian name, showing the graces of faith, holiness, and love. Applying the parable generally, Origen (<span class="accented">ap.</span> I. Williams) says, "If any one will observe the populous congregations, and inquire how many there are who live a better kind of life, and are being transformed in the renewing of their mind; and how many who are careless in their conversation and conformed to this world, he will perceive the use of this voice of our Saviour's, 'Many are called, but few chosen;' and in another place it has been said, 'Many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able' (<a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>); and, 'Strive earnestly to enter in by the narrow gate; for few there be that find it' (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
