It implies that the message may be difficult for some to accept due to preconceived notions or expectations. This reflects the broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus often speaks in parables and teachings that require spiritual insight and openness (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>). The call to be "willing" underscores the importance of faith and openness to divine revelation.<p><b>he is the Elijah</b><br>In Jewish tradition, Elijah was expected to return before the coming of the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>. Elijah was a significant prophet known for his powerful ministry and miracles (1 Kings 17-19). By identifying John the Baptist as "the Elijah," Jesus is affirming that John fulfills this prophetic role, preparing the way for the Messiah. This identification is crucial because it connects the Old Testament prophecies with the New Testament fulfillment, showing continuity in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>who was to come</b><br>This phrase refers to the expectation of Elijah's return as a precursor to the Messiah's arrival. The Jewish people anticipated Elijah's coming as a sign of the Messianic age. By stating that John the Baptist is "the Elijah who was to come," Jesus is asserting that the prophetic expectations have been met in John, who came in the "spirit and power of Elijah" (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>). This fulfillment of prophecy is a testament to the authenticity of Jesus' messianic claims and the unfolding of God's salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the crowd about John the Baptist's role in God's plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>Referred to as "the Elijah who was to come," John is a pivotal figure in preparing the way for Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet from the Old Testament, known for his powerful ministry and expected to return before the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience Jesus is speaking to, which includes His disciples and others who are following Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The overarching theme of Jesus' ministry, which John the Baptist heralded.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy_fulfillment.htm">Understanding Prophecy Fulfillment</a></b><br>Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Elijah.

Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.">John 1:21</a>); it has lingered as a tradition of Judaism down to our own time. A vacant chair is placed for Elijah at all great solemnities. Even Christian interpreters have cherished the belief that Elijah will appear in person before the second Advent of the Lord. The true meaning of the words of Malachi had, however, been suggested in the words of the angel in <a href="/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a>, "He shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias," and is here distinctly confirmed. The words "if ye will (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> are willing to) receive it" imply the consciousness that our Lord was setting aside a popular and strongly-fixed belief: "If you are willing and able to receive the truth that John was in very deed doing the work of Elijah, you need look for no other in the future."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14</span> - In Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">And if ye will receive it</span>.

For the reception of a truth depends upon the attitude of the will In this case to acknowledge John as Elijah would mean to accept the present consequences of that reformation which Elijah was to bring about (<a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>). But "the human will has a natural disinclination to cultivate and sharpen the conscience in combination with the knowledge of the law, has no desire to look into this mirror, and men as a rule desire to have quite a different picture of themselves from that which conscience shows them" (Marten-<span class="accented">sen's</span> 'Christian Ethics,' 1. &sect; 119).
