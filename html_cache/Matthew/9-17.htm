These skins were flexible when new but became brittle with age. New wine, still fermenting, would expand, requiring a flexible container. The metaphor of new wine represents the new covenant and teachings of Jesus, which could not be contained within the old structures of Judaism, such as the Pharisaic traditions. This imagery is consistent with the transformative nature of Jesus' ministry, which brought fulfillment to the law and prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>If they do, the skins will burst,</b><br>The bursting of old wineskins symbolizes the inability of the old covenant to contain the new life and teachings brought by Christ. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of His time, who were often resistant to His message. The bursting signifies the inevitable failure of trying to fit the new covenant into the old legalistic framework, as seen in the conflicts Jesus had with the Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12:1-14</a>).<p><b>the wine will spill,</b><br>Spilled wine represents the loss and waste that occurs when the new covenant is forced into old forms. This can be seen as a warning against trying to merge the grace and truth of the gospel with the rigid structures of the law. The spilling of wine also suggests the futility of attempting to maintain old traditions at the expense of embracing the new life offered through Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1-4</a>).<p><b>and the wineskins will be ruined.</b><br>The ruined wineskins illustrate the destruction that comes from clinging to outdated religious systems. This is a call to recognize the obsolescence of the old covenant in light of the new covenant established by Jesus' death and resurrection. The ruin of the wineskins serves as a metaphor for the spiritual desolation that results from rejecting the transformative power of the gospel (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>).<p><b>Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins,</b><br>New wineskins represent the new structures and forms needed to contain the dynamic and expanding nature of the gospel. This suggests the necessity of a new heart and spirit to receive the teachings of Christ (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). The new wineskins symbolize the church, the body of believers, who are called to live out the new covenant in the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>and both are preserved.&#8221;</b><br>The preservation of both wine and wineskins signifies the harmony and sustainability of the new covenant when it is embraced in its proper context. This reflects the enduring nature of the gospel and its ability to bring life and growth to those who accept it. The preservation also points to the eternal nature of the kingdom of God, which is unshakeable and everlasting (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this metaphor to teach about the newness of His message and the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_of_john_the_baptist.htm">Disciples of John the Baptist</a></b><br>They are part of the context, as they question Jesus about fasting, prompting this teaching.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often questioned Jesus' practices and teachings, representing the old religious system.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wineskins.htm">Wineskins</a></b><br>A metaphorical element in the parable, representing structures or systems that hold spiritual truths.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_wine.htm">New Wine</a></b><br>Symbolizes the new covenant and teachings of Jesus, which require new forms and understandings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_renewal.htm">The Necessity of Renewal</a></b><br>Just as new wine requires new wineskins, our spiritual lives require renewal and transformation to accommodate the teachings of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/embracing_change.htm">Embracing Change</a></b><br>The Kingdom of God often requires us to let go of old traditions and embrace new ways of thinking and living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preservation_of_the_gospel.htm">Preservation of the Gospel</a></b><br>The new wine of the Gospel must be preserved in ways that honor its transformative power, avoiding rigid structures that cannot contain it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_transformation.htm">Personal Transformation</a></b><br>Believers are called to be transformed by the renewing of their minds, allowing the Holy Spirit to create new wineskins within us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_church_adaptation.htm">Community and Church Adaptation</a></b><br>Churches and communities must be willing to adapt and change to effectively carry the message of Christ in a contemporary context.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_9_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 9:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_17_Spiritual_renewal_s_role.htm">How does Matthew 9:17 illustrate the importance of spiritual renewal in our lives?

These, as they grew dry with age, became very liable to crack, and were unable to resist the pressure of the fermenting liquor. If the mistake were made, the bottles were marred, and the wine spilt. When we interpret the parable, we see at once that the "new wine" represents the inner, as the garment did the outer, aspect of Christian life, the new energies and gifts of the Spirit, which, as on the day of Pentecost, were likened to new wine (<a href="/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>). In dealing with men, our Lord did not bestow these gifts suddenly, even on His own disciples, any more than He imposed rules of life for which men were not ready. As the action of organised churches has too often reproduced the mistake of sewing the patch of new cloth on the old garment, so in the action of enthusiastic or mystic sects, in the history of Montanism, Quakerism in its earlier stages, the growth of the so-called Catholic and Apostolic Church, which had its origin in the history of Edward Irving, we have that of pouring new wine into old bottles. The teaching of our Lord points in both instances to gradual training, speaking the truth as men are able to bear it; reserving many truths because they "cannot bear them now."<p>St. Luke adds, as before, a new aspect of the illustration: "No man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better." See Note on <a href="/luke/5-39.htm" title="No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.">Luke 5:39</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither do men put new wine into old bottles</span>; <span class="accented">wine-skins</span> (Revised Version); cf. <a href="/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a>.
