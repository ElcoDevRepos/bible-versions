In the context of <a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12</a>, Jesus is in a synagogue, a place of worship and teaching, which underscores the religious and communal setting of this miracle. The man with the withered hand represents those marginalized by physical ailments, often seen as outcasts in Jewish society. Jesus' willingness to address him directly challenges the prevailing cultural norms and demonstrates His compassion and authority.<p><b>&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' command to the man is significant because it requires an act of faith. The man is asked to do something that seems impossible due to his condition. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where Jesus requires a demonstration of faith before performing a miracle, such as when He tells the paralytic to take up his mat and walk (<a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>). The act of stretching out his hand symbolizes obedience and trust in Jesus' power to heal.<p><b>So he stretched it out,</b><br>The man's response to Jesus' command is immediate and obedient, reflecting his faith. This action is a testament to the power of Jesus' words and the man's belief in them. It also serves as a model for believers, illustrating the importance of responding to Jesus' instructions with faith and action. The act of stretching out his hand, despite its previous condition, signifies a step of faith that leads to healing.<p><b>and it was restored to full use,</b><br>The restoration of the man's hand signifies the completeness of Jesus' healing power. This miracle not only addresses the physical ailment but also restores the man's ability to participate fully in society, as physical deformities often led to social and economic marginalization. The restoration is immediate and complete, showcasing Jesus' divine authority over creation and His ability to make whole what is broken.<p><b>just like the other.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality and perfection of the healing. The man's hand is not only healed but is made identical to the other, healthy hand. This reflects the biblical theme of restoration and wholeness found throughout Scripture, such as in the prophecies of the coming Messiah who would bring healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>). It also points to the eschatological hope of complete restoration in the new creation, where all things will be made new and perfect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
