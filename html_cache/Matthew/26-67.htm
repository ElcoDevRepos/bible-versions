This act fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the Suffering Servant is described as offering His back to those who beat Him and not hiding His face from disgrace and spitting. This moment highlights the humiliation and degradation Jesus willingly endured, emphasizing His role as the suffering Messiah.<p><b>and struck Him</b><br>The act of striking Jesus was not only a physical assault but also a symbolic rejection of His authority and identity as the Messiah. This treatment reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected by men. The striking also prefigures the suffering and sacrifice Jesus would endure on the cross, underscoring His submission to the Father's will and His love for humanity.<p><b>Others slapped Him</b><br>The slapping of Jesus by others indicates a collective rejection and mockery by the religious leaders and those present. This act of violence was part of the illegal and unjust trial Jesus faced, as Jewish law prohibited such treatment before a formal conviction.

When the meeting broke up, Jesus was for a time left to the brutal cruelty and the unbridled insolence of the guards and servants.
