The men bringing the paralytic demonstrate a communal effort and faith, reflecting the cultural importance of community and support in Jewish society. The act of carrying the paralytic on a mat indicates the severity of his condition, as he is unable to move independently. This scene parallels the account in <a href="/mark/2.htm">Mark 2:1-12</a>, where the friends of the paralytic lower him through a roof, emphasizing their determination and faith. The mat, a simple woven structure, symbolizes the man's dependence and helplessness, setting the stage for Jesus' miraculous intervention.<p><b>When Jesus saw their faith,</b><br>The faith of the men is a crucial element in this narrative. It is not merely the faith of the paralytic but the collective faith of his friends that prompts Jesus to act. This highlights the biblical principle that faith can be communal and intercessory, as seen in <a href="/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>, where the prayer of faith can heal the sick. Jesus' recognition of their faith underscores the importance of belief and trust in God's power, a recurring theme throughout the Gospels.<p><b>He said to the paralytic, &#8220;Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus addresses the paralytic with compassion and authority. The term "son" conveys a sense of care and belonging, indicating Jesus' role as a spiritual father and healer. The command to "take courage" reassures the man, preparing him for the transformative act that follows. The declaration "your sins are forgiven" is significant, as it prioritizes spiritual healing over physical healing. This statement challenges the prevailing Jewish belief that physical ailments were directly linked to personal sin, as seen in <a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2-3</a>. By forgiving sins, Jesus asserts His divine authority, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing the iniquities of many. This act foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness of sins through Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, central to Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, known for His teaching, healing, and authority.

(3) That among the hearers were Pharisees and Doctors of the Law, who had come, not only from "every village of Galilee and Judaea," but also "from Jerusalem." The last fact is important as one of the few traces in the first three Gospels of an unrecorded ministry in Jerusalem, and, as will be seen, throws light on much that follows. They had apparently come to see how the new Teacher, who had so startled them at Jerusalem, was carrying on His work in Galilee, and, as far as they could, to hinder it. (4) That "the power of the Lord was present to heal them" (<a href="/luke/5-17.htm" title="And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.">Luke 5:17</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> that as He taught, the sick were brought to Him, and, either by word or touch, were cured.<p><span class= "bld">A man sick of the palsy.</span>--St. Matthew and St. Mark use the popular term "paralytic;" St. Luke, with perhaps more technical precision, the participle of the verb, "who was paralysed." The man was borne on a couch (St. Mark uses the Greek form of the Latin <span class= "ital">grabatum,</span> the bed or mattress of the poor) carried by four bearers (<a href="/mark/2-3.htm" title="And they come to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.">Mark 2:3</a>). They sought to bring him through the door, but were hindered by the crowd; and then going outside the house, they got upon the roof, removed part of the roof (the light structure of Eastern houses made the work comparatively easy), let him down with ropes through the opening into the midst of the crowd, just in front of the Teacher (<a href="/mark/2-4.htm" title="And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="/luke/5-19.htm" title="And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went on the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the middle before Jesus.">Luke 5:19</a>). This persistency implied faith in His power to heal on the part both of the sick man and the bearers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, they brought to him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). Bengel's remark, "<span class="accented">Offerebant -</span> Tales oblationes factae sunt Salvatori plurimae, gratae," though very beautiful, is, from its undue insistence on the sacrificial use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, hardly exegesis. Matthew omits the difficulty that was experienced in bringing him to our Lord (see parallel passages), yet this alone accounts for the special commendation of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">A man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed.</span> Probably a mat or quilt (ver. 6). Professor Marshall, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span> for March, 1891, p. 215, has a most interesting note showing that the differences between "lying on a bed" (Matthew)and "carried by four" (Mark), and even "they sought to bring him in, and to place him before him" (Luke, who has already mentioned "on a bed" ), may be explained by being different translations of an original Aramaic sentence. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus seeing their faith</span>. Including that of the paralytic, who, as we may gather from the obedience he afterwards shows, had agreed to and had encouraged the special efforts of his bearers. <span class="cmt_word">Said unto the sick of the palsy; Son,</span> <span class="cmt_word">be of good cheer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Son.</span> So Mark, but Luke has "man" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>), which, though more usual in Greek (though still Hebraic, for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> would have been in accordance with classical usage), is much more colourless. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as a term of address, is elsewhere in the New Testament used only where there is relationship physical (<a href="/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28</a>; <a href="/luke/2-48.htm">Luke 2:48</a>; <a href="/luke/15-31.htm">Luke 15:31</a>; even Luke 16:25) or moral, especially that of pupil and teacher (<a href="/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; cf <a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>). It therefore implies that there is both sympathy and much common ground between the speaker and him whom he addresses. It is the antithesis of <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> (cf. further, <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 22). Thus it here served affectionately to encourage the sufferer in soul and body, preparing him to receive the announcement following. Matthew emphasizes its purpose by prefixing <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sins be</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">are</span>; expressing clearly that the words are the statement of a fact, not merely the expression of a command. <span class="cmt_word">Forgiven thee</span>; Revised Version omits "thee" (genuine in Luke), with <span class="accented">manuscripts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Matthew and Mark use the present of general statement, Luke the perfect (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Doric; Winer, 14:3. a), to express a past fact of permanent significance. Observe the order of the Lord's assurance, as recorded in the true text. Courage, sympathy, forgiveness, and, only after all else, recalling individual sins. As the assurance of forgiveness is delightful to the soul, so is it often helpful to the body. Hence possibly our Lord's method in this case, for the man "inter spem metumque dubius pendebat" (Wetstein). Compare for the conjunction of the two, <a href="/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>, and, as a still closer parallel to our passage, Talm. Bab., 'Nedarim,' 41<span class="accented">a</span>. "R. Hija bar Abba said, The sick doth not recover from his sickness until all his sins be forgiven him, for it is said, 'Who pardoneth all thy iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.'" So also Qimbi (on <a href="/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5</a>, "Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee" ): "He does not say, Heal my body," for it is his sins that are the cause of his sickness, but if God heal his soul from its sickness, viz. by making atonement for his sins, then his body is healed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Just then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[some men] brought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(prosepheron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4374.htm">Strong's 4374: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and phero; to bear towards, i.e. Lead to, tender, treat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
