Women were often marginalized in first-century Jewish society, yet the Gospels frequently depict them as key figures in Jesus' ministry. This act of coming to Jesus demonstrates her boldness and faith, reminiscent of other women in Scripture who sought Jesus' help or offered Him worship, such as the woman with the issue of blood (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>).<p><b>with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume</b><br>Alabaster was a fine, translucent stone commonly used in the ancient world to store precious ointments and perfumes. The mention of an "expensive perfume" indicates the value of the offering, suggesting it was likely nard, a costly aromatic oil imported from India. This act of bringing something valuable to Jesus symbolizes the woman's devotion and willingness to sacrifice for Him, paralleling the Old Testament practice of offering the best to God (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>).<p><b>which she poured on His head</b><br>Anointing the head was a customary practice in ancient Israel, often associated with hospitality, honor, and consecration. Kings and priests were anointed as a sign of their divine appointment (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). By anointing Jesus' head, the woman acknowledges His messianic identity, foreshadowing His role as the Anointed One, the Christ. This act also prefigures His burial, as anointing was part of Jewish burial customs (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39-40</a>).<p><b>as He reclined at the table</b><br>Reclining at the table was a typical posture during meals in the Greco-Roman world, indicating a formal dining setting. This setting underscores the communal and intimate nature of the event. The act of anointing during a meal further emphasizes the themes of fellowship and worship, as meals were often occasions for teaching and significant interactions in Jesus' ministry (<a href="/luke/22-14.htm">Luke 22:14-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, reclining at the table, symbolizing His role as the honored guest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Unnamed in this passage, she performs an act of devotion by anointing Jesus with expensive perfume.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/alabaster_jar.htm">Alabaster Jar</a></b><br>A container made from a fine stone, used to hold precious ointments or perfumes, signifying the value of the contents.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/expensive_perfume.htm">Expensive Perfume</a></b><br>Represents a costly sacrifice, indicating the woman's deep reverence and love for Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reclining_at_the_table.htm">Reclining at the Table</a></b><br>A customary position during meals in ancient times, indicating a setting of fellowship and intimacy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/extravagant_worship.htm">Extravagant Worship</a></b><br>The woman's act of anointing Jesus with expensive perfume demonstrates the importance of offering our best to God, regardless of the cost.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_sacrifice.htm">Preparation for Sacrifice</a></b><br>Her action foreshadows Jesus' impending death and burial, reminding us of the necessity of preparing our hearts for His sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courageous_devotion.htm">Courageous Devotion</a></b><br>The woman&#8217;s willingness to perform such a bold act in a public setting encourages believers to express their faith openly and without fear of judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_sacrifice.htm">Value of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The costly perfume symbolizes the value of sacrificial giving, challenging us to consider what we are willing to give up for the sake of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_christ's_worth.htm">Recognition of Christ&#8217;s Worth</a></b><br>Her act signifies a deep understanding of Jesus' true identity and worth, prompting us to reflect on how we perceive and honor Him in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_26_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 26:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Woman_s_act_in_Matthew_26_7_as_worship.htm">How does the woman's act in Matthew 26:7 demonstrate sacrificial worship to Jesus?

It is hardly conceivable (unless we conjecture that she came in veiled, and that St. John alone knew her) that the writers of the first two Gospels, or those from whom they derived their knowledge, could have been ignorant who she was, and we can only see in their suppression of the name an example of the singular reticence which sealed their lips as to every member of the family at Bethany. A prevalent tradition or conjecture in the Western Church has identified the sister of Lazarus with the woman that was a sinner, of Luke 7, and, on this assumption what we now read was a repetition of an offering of love that had been made before. Of this, however, there is not the shadow of proof (see Notes on <a href="/context/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37-38</a>). It may well have been, on the other hand, that the household of Bethany had heard of that act, and that this suggested the way in which love and gratitude now manifested themselves.<p><span class= "bld">An alabaster box of very precious ointment.</span>--The box was probably a vase of the material described as alabaster (according to one etymology, however, that word described originally the shape of the vase, as made without handles, and was subsequently extended to the material of which such vases were commonly made), with the lid cemented down, so as not to admit of extraction like a cork or stopper. St. John (<a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>) describes the quantity as a pound (<span class= "ital">litra=</span>about twelve ounces); and both St. John and St. Mark add that it was "of spikenard." The word so rendered, however (<span class= "ital">pistike</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is found only in those two passages (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a>, <a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>), and it is open to question whether it bears this meaning, or means "pure, genuine, unadulterated." The "nard" so described is identified by botanists with the <span class= "ital">Nardostachys jatamansi,</span> the <span class= "ital">sumbul</span> of India, but was probably applied by Greeks and Romans to other perfumes. The value of the ointment is roughly estimated afterwards at three hundred <span class= "ital">denarii</span> (<a href="/john/12-5.htm" title="Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?">John 12:5</a>). Such preparations, like genuine <span class= "ital">atar</span> of roses in the modern East, consisting, as they did mainly, in the essential oils of carefully cultivated flowers, often fetched an almost fabulous price. The fact that Mary had such an unguent by her indicates that the household of Bethany belonged to the comparatively wealthy class, and so agrees with the general impression left by the record of John 11. It is a probable conjecture that a like costly unguent had been used in embalming the body of the brother who had so recently been raised from the dead, and that this gave a special point to our Lord's comment on the act. St. Mark adds that she broke or crushed the vessel in order to pour out the ointment; St. John, that she anointed His feet, and wiped them with her hair. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A woman.</span> St. John identifies her as Mary the sister of Lazarus and Martha. Why the synoptists omit her name is not known; it is equally uncertain why St. John makes no mention of Simon. None of the synoptists notice Lazarus, though St. Luke names Martha and Mary (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38, 39</a>). It may have been at the time a matter of prudence or delicacy not to draw attention to them by name. But there is no discrepancy. One narrative supplements the other, and it is best to be thankful for what we have, and not to be over curious concerning points not explained. <span class="cmt_word">An alabaster box</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). A cruse or flask made of alabaster, which is a white calcareous spar resembling marble, but setter and more easily worked. These cruses were generally round shaped, with a long narrow neck, the orifice of which was sealed. It may be the breaking of this seal to which St. Mark refers in his account (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>), when he says that "she brake the box." <span class="cmt_word">Very precious ointment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). St. Mark calls it "pistic nard," rendered in our version "spikenard." The word in our text seems to be used for any salve or ointment which contained myrrh as one of its ingredients. Nard is found in Syria, the Himalayas, and other parts of India. From its root a strong scented unguent was made, which, being imported from a long distance, was very costly. <span class="cmt_word">Poured it on his head.</span> It is to be noted that in the original there is no "it" after "poured;" so there is nothing to imply that the whole was poured upon his head. This helps to reconcile this account with that of the fourth evangelist (Morison). St. John tells that she anointed his feet, which was unusual; she first anointed his head, and then his feet, wiping the latter with her long flowing hair. Anointing the head was not an uncommon way of honouring distinguished guests; but Mary had another thought in her mind which the Lord discerned (ver. 12<span class="cmt_word">). As he sat</span> at meat; <span class="accented">as he reclined at table.</span> The Jews had adopted the Roman mode of eating (comp. <a href="/matthew/22-10.htm">Matthew 22:10</a>, where the word rendered "guests" is "the recumbent"). St. Matthew does not mention that a special supper was arranged for him (<a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>), as if to do him honour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">a woman</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(gyn&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
