It is a directive to grasp the significance of the teaching, often used by Jesus to highlight a key point. In biblical context, understanding is frequently associated with spiritual insight and discernment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>, which underscores the value of wisdom and understanding.<p><b>If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming,</b><br>The "homeowner" represents individuals responsible for their spiritual well-being. The "watch of the night" refers to the Roman division of the night into four watches, each lasting three hours. This cultural reference would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, highlighting the unpredictability of the thief's arrival. The imagery of a thief is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>, to describe the unexpected nature of Christ's return.<p><b>he would have kept watch</b><br>This phrase implies vigilance and readiness. In the historical context, watchfulness was crucial for protection against theft or attack. Spiritually, it calls for constant preparedness for the Lord's return, echoing Jesus' exhortation in <a href="/matthew/25-13.htm">Matthew 25:13</a> to "keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour."<p><b>and would not have let his house be broken into.</b><br>The "house" symbolizes one's life or spiritual state. Allowing it to be "broken into" suggests a failure to guard against spiritual complacency or sin. This imagery reinforces the need for spiritual alertness and moral integrity. The concept of safeguarding one's spiritual house is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which advises guarding the heart, the wellspring of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/homeowner.htm">Homeowner</a></b><br>Represents individuals or believers who are responsible for their spiritual vigilance and readiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thief.htm">Thief</a></b><br>Symbolizes unexpected events or the sudden return of Christ, emphasizing the need for constant preparedness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Represents one's life or spiritual state, which needs to be guarded against spiritual complacency.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/watch_of_the_night.htm">Watch of the Night</a></b><br>Refers to the time periods during the night, indicating the unpredictability of the event.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_in.htm">Breaking In</a></b><br>Illustrates the potential spiritual loss or consequences of not being prepared.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_faith.htm">Vigilance in Faith</a></b><br>Just as a homeowner must be alert to protect his house, believers must remain spiritually vigilant, maintaining a strong relationship with God through prayer, study, and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_times.htm">Understanding the Times</a></b><br>Recognize the signs of the times and live with an awareness of the spiritual realities around us, being prepared for Christ's return at any moment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_complacency.htm">Guarding Against Complacency</a></b><br>Avoid spiritual laziness by actively engaging in community worship, service, and personal spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_purpose.htm">Living with Purpose</a></b><br>Use the knowledge of Christ's imminent return to motivate a life of holiness, integrity, and mission-focused living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouraging_one_another.htm">Encouraging One Another</a></b><br>Foster a community of accountability and encouragement, helping each other to stay alert and prepared for the Lord's return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_24_43_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 24:43?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_43_Why_stay_spiritually_alert.htm">How does Matthew 24:43 emphasize the importance of spiritual vigilance in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_thief_in_Matthew_24_43.htm">What does the "thief" symbolize in Matthew 24:43, and how should we respond?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_24_43_daily.htm">How can we apply the lesson of preparedness from Matthew 24:43 daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_Christ_s_return_2.htm">What other scriptures reinforce the call to be watchful and ready for Christ's return?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Matt_24_43_on_spiritual_readiness.htm">How does understanding Matthew 24:43 influence our approach to spiritual discipline and readiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_of_Matthew_24_43_on_readiness.htm">What does Matthew 24:43 teach about being prepared for Christ's return?

It may be noted, however, that the variations in the three reports of this discourse indicate a comparatively free treatment of it, the natural result, probably, of its having been often reproduced, wholly or in part, orally before it was committed to writing. On ordinary grounds of evidence, St. Mark's report, assuming his connection with St. Peter, would seem likely to come nearest to the very words spoken by our Lord.<p><span class= "bld">The goodman of the house.</span>--Better, as in <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:1</a>., <span class= "ital">householder.</span><p><span class= "bld">In what watch.</span>--The night-watches were four in number, of three hours each.

The significance of the parable is easy to see. The householder is the disciple of Christ, the thief is Christ himself, who comes on the unwatchful when and where they expect him not. It is, indeed, a strange comparison, but one calculated to alarm the unwary, and to show the necessity of the caution enjoined. Similar warnings are found elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>. The exposition which regards the thief as the devil is not so suitable to the context. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/24-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">understand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(gin&#333;skete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(ekeino)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1565.htm">Strong's 1565: </a> </span><span class="str2">That, that one there, yonder.
