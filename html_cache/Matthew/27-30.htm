This act fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would be mocked and spat upon. It highlights the depth of Jesus' humiliation and the rejection He faced from those He came to save.<p><b>and took the staff</b><br>The staff, or reed, was initially given to Jesus as a mock scepter, symbolizing a king's authority. This act of mockery was part of the Roman soldiers' cruel game, as they sarcastically hailed Him as "King of the Jews." The staff, a symbol of authority, being used against Him, underscores the irony of the situation&#8212;Jesus, the true King, was being mocked with symbols of His own kingship.<p><b>and struck Him on the head repeatedly</b><br>The act of striking Jesus on the head with the staff was not only a physical assault but also a symbolic act of rejecting His authority and kingship.
