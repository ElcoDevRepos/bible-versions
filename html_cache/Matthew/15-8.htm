In the context of <a href="/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and scribes who prioritize human traditions over God's commandments. The reference to honoring with lips suggests a form of worship that is verbal and outward but lacks sincerity. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes Israel for similar behavior. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on oral tradition and public displays of piety, which could easily become performative rather than heartfelt.<p><b>but their hearts are far from Me</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This phrase indicates a disconnect between external actions and internal devotion. Historically, the heart was seen as the seat of genuine faith and commitment. Jesus emphasizes that true worship requires alignment of heart and action. This critique is consistent with other biblical teachings, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The prophetic nature of this statement calls for a return to authentic worship, foreshadowing the new covenant where the law is written on the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the Pharisees and scribes who were questioning Him about the traditions of the elders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who were known for their strict adherence to Jewish law and traditions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet whose words Jesus quotes in this verse, originally found in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were present during this teaching and often received further explanation of His teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of Jewish worship and the location where many of these religious debates took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authentic_worship.htm">Authentic Worship</a></b><br>True worship is not just about external expressions but involves a sincere heart devoted to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_condition.htm">Heart Condition</a></b><br>God values the condition of our hearts over our outward religious practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_warning.htm">Hypocrisy Warning</a></b><br>We must guard against hypocrisy, ensuring our actions align with our professed beliefs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Regularly examine your heart and motives to ensure they align with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/tradition_vs._commandment.htm">Tradition vs. Commandment</a></b><br>Evaluate whether traditions in your life align with God's commandments or distract from them.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_15_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 15:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Align_hearts_with_words_in_worship_2.htm">How can we ensure our hearts align with our words in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_8_Dangers_of_empty_traditions.htm">What does Matthew 15:8 reveal about the dangers of empty traditions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_29_13_and_Matthew_15_8_link.htm">How does Isaiah 29:13 connect with Matthew 15:8's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_hypocrisy_in_faith.htm">In what ways can we guard against hypocrisy in our faith practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Cultivate_daily_devotion_to_God.htm">How can we cultivate genuine devotion to God in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_8_on_true_worship.htm">What does Matthew 15:8 reveal about the nature of genuine worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_8_Authenticity_of_faith.htm">How does Matthew 15:8 challenge the authenticity of religious practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matthew_15_8_address_hypocrisy.htm">In what ways does Matthew 15:8 address hypocrisy in faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_adrian_rogers'_impact.htm">Do they honor me with lips, not hearts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_censorship.htm">What does 'Their hearts are far from Me' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'hearts_far_from_me'_mean.htm">What does "Their hearts are far from Me" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/do_they_honor_me_with_lips,_not_hearts.htm">Do they honor me with lips, not hearts?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 15:8 Mean</div><b>These people</b><p>&#8226;
