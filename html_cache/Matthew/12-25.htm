This ability to know the hearts and minds of people is a characteristic attributed to God throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). It underscores Jesus' divine nature and authority, setting the stage for His teaching on unity and division.<p><b>Jesus said to them</b><br>Jesus directly addresses the Pharisees, who were accusing Him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul. His response is both a defense of His ministry and a teaching moment. This interaction highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who often opposed Him due to His challenge to their authority and interpretation of the Law.<p><b>Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste</b><br>This statement is a universal principle that applies to any organized group, whether a nation, organization, or spiritual entity. Historically, kingdoms and empires that experienced internal strife often fell, such as the division of Israel into the northern and southern kingdoms, which eventually led to their downfall. The principle also applies to spiritual warfare, emphasizing the importance of unity in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>and every city or household divided against itself will not stand</b><br>Jesus extends the principle from kingdoms to smaller social units like cities and households. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where family and community were central to Jewish life. The statement serves as a warning against internal conflict and division, which can lead to destruction. It also foreshadows the unity required within the early Christian church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where believers are called to be of one heart and mind.<br><br>Overall, this passage emphasizes the importance of unity in all aspects of life and serves as a warning against the destructive nature of division.

His words are both corrective and gracious, aiming to lead listeners into the light.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28&#8211;29</a> notes that the crowds were amazed because He taught &#8220;as one who had authority,&#8221; the same authority evident here.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a> His word carries power; when He speaks, spiritual realities shift.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a> emphasizes that hearing and believing His word brings life, highlighting the importance of listening when He addresses us.<p>Christ does not leave false accusations unanswered. Instead, He provides a principle so clear that even His opponents must acknowledge its common-sense force.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste</b><p>Here Jesus sets forth a universal principle: internal division destroys from within.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/3-24.htm">Mark 3:24&#8211;25</a> and <a href="/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17</a> record the parallel statement, reinforcing the lesson across the Synoptic Gospels.<p>&#8226; Historical examples abound: the split between northern Israel and Judah in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a> weakened both kingdoms; the revolt of Absalom in <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15-18</a> nearly ruined David&#8217;s realm.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a> warns Egypt of civil strife that would &#8220;set Egyptian against Egyptian,&#8221; again showing how division invites devastation.<p>The immediate application silences the Pharisees&#8217; claim that Jesus casts out demons by Satan&#8217;s power. If Satan were empowering Jesus to expel his own agents, Satan&#8217;s &#8220;kingdom&#8221; would be self-destructing. Since a collapsing kingdom cannot endure, their accusation collapses under its own weight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every city or household divided against itself will not stand</b><p>Jesus narrows the principle from the national to the local and personal level.<p>&#8226; Unity among believers is urged in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, calling the church to be &#8220;perfectly united in mind and judgment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a> exhorts Christians to &#8220;make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For households, <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a> celebrates how &#8220;good and pleasant&#8221; it is when brothers dwell in unity, while <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13-14</a> links forgiveness and love to communal harmony.<p>Division undermines stability whether in a city council, a congregation, or a family dinner table. Jesus&#8217; words challenge disciples to guard unity and reject anything that fractures fellowship, knowing that strife gives the enemy a foothold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/12-25.htm">Matthew 12:25</a> shows Christ reading hearts, speaking with divine authority, and teaching a timeless truth: division destroys. From nations down to families, unity is essential for endurance. Satan&#8217;s kingdom cannot be behind Jesus&#8217; deliverance ministry, because internal war ruins any realm. Believers therefore cherish oneness, recognizing that Jesus&#8212;who sees all thoughts&#8212;calls His people to stand together in truth and love so they may flourish instead of fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Jesus knew their thoughts.</span>--The Searcher of Hearts saw the meaning of the whispers and the looks of real or affected horror, and now enters on a full answer to the charge. Of all the accusations brought against Him this was the one that caused the greatest Pain, and drew forth the most indignant answer. He had restored peace and joy, freedom of reason and will to those who had lost them, had been doing His Father's work on earth, and He was accused of being in league with the powers of evil. The work of healing was represented as the bait of the Tempter luring men to their final destruction.<p><span class= "bld">Every kingdom divided against itself.</span>--The answer assumes, as the teaching of the New Testament does from first to last, the existence of a kingdom of evil, compact and organised, with a distinct unity of purpose. The laws which govern the life of other kingdoms are applicable to that also. Its head and ruler was not likely to enter on a work which was self-destructive.
