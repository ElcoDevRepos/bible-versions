The authority of Jesus is evident here, as He speaks a single word to command the demons. This reflects His divine power over the spiritual realm, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels. The use of "Go" signifies not only a command but also a release, showing Jesus' compassion for the possessed men. This moment fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah's power over evil, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of setting captives free.<p><b>So they came out and went into the pigs,</b><br>The demons' request to enter the pigs (as seen in the preceding verses) highlights their desire to inhabit a physical form. The choice of pigs is significant, as pigs were considered unclean animals according to Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). This event takes place in a predominantly Gentile region, which explains the presence of a large herd of pigs. The transfer of demons from humans to animals underscores the destructive nature of demonic forces and the mercy of Jesus in liberating the men.<p><b>and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea</b><br>The geographical setting is crucial here. The steep bank leading to the Sea of Galilee provides a vivid backdrop for this dramatic event. The topography of the region supports the narrative, as there are indeed steep cliffs in the area. The demons' influence drives the pigs to self-destruction, illustrating the chaos and death that accompany demonic possession. This act serves as a visual demonstration of the destructive power of evil and the deliverance Jesus provides.<p><b>and died in the waters.</b><br>The death of the pigs in the waters symbolizes the ultimate defeat of evil. Water often represents chaos and judgment in biblical literature, as seen in the story of Noah's flood (Genesis 7) and the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14). The drowning of the pigs signifies the cleansing and purifying power of Jesus' intervention. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory over evil through Christ's death and resurrection, where sin and death are defeated. The incident also serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting Jesus' authority and the destructive end of those who remain under demonic influence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His authority over the spiritual realm by commanding the demons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>- Spiritual beings that possessed two men and requested to enter the herd of pigs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pigs.htm">Pigs</a></b><br>- A herd of swine that the demons entered, leading to their destruction in the sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea.htm">Sea</a></b><br>- The body of water into which the pigs rushed and drowned, symbolizing chaos and destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gadara.htm">Gadara (or Gergesenes)</a></b><br>- The region where this event took place, a Gentile area known for its pig farming.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_christ.htm">Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' command over the demons demonstrates His supreme authority over all creation, including the spiritual realm.

The scene offers a vivid reminder that the same Lord who set those men free still commands every spiritual power today and secures lasting freedom for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">He said unto them, Go.</span>--Men have asked sometimes, in scorn, why the word was spoken; why permission was given for a destructive work which seemed alike needless and fruitless. The so-called rationalistic explanation, that the demoniacs drove the swine down the cliff in a last paroxysm of frenzy, is no solution of the difficulty, for, even if that hypothesis were on other grounds tenable, it is clear that our Lord's words sanctioned what they did. We are at least on the right track in suggesting that only in some such way could the man be delivered from the inextricable confusion between himself and the unclean spirits in which he had been involved. Not till he saw the demoniac forces that had oppressed him transferred to the bodies of other creatures, and working on them the effects which they had wrought on him, could he believe in his own deliverance. Those who measure rightly the worth of a human spirit thus restored to itself, to its fellow-men, and to God, will not think that the destruction of brute life was too dear a price to pay for its restoration. Other subordinate ends--such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as that it was a penalty on those who kept the unclean beasts for their violation of the Law, or that it taught men that it was through their indulgence of the swinish nature in themselves that they became subject to the darker and more demoniac passions--have been suggested with more or less plausibility.<p><span class= "bld">Down a steep place.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">down the cliff.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Go.</span> As they asked; for he was not yet come to send them to their final home. He would not employ his inherent Divine power even against the kingdom of Satan, or forcibly disturb the conditions under which evil existed in the world. Notice further: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That as regards the right to destroy the swine when they were the property of others, our Lord in no way destroyed them himself, but only did not interfere with the powers of the evil spirits in giving them permission to work out their own purposes. It is possible, too, though far from certain, that the owners of the swine were acting illegally in owning them (though even then our Lord was not constituted as judge, <a href="/luke/12-14.htm">Luke 12:14</a>); but this supposes first that they were Jews, and secondly that it was illegal for Jews to keep swine, of which <span class="accented">suppositions</span> not even the latter can be clearly proved either by Scripture or by early forms of tradition. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The destruction of the swine might well be beneficial to the complete recovery of the men. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It would fully arouse the <span class="accented">Gerasenes</span>, and bring home to them the <span class="accented">holiness of</span> the Lord from whom evil spirits fled, and the call to personal holiness that such a Presence demanded. The result of their being thus amused lay with themselves (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/8-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#960;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Hypagete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5217.htm">Strong's 5217: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go away, depart, begone, die.
