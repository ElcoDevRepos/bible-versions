The scene is set at Golgotha, where Jesus is being crucified. The crowd includes Roman soldiers, Jewish leaders, and passersby. The crucifixion was a public event, and many would have gathered to witness it. The phrase "heard this" refers to Jesus' cry from the cross, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" This cry is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, a messianic psalm that foreshadows the suffering of the Messiah.<p><b>they said, &#8220;He is calling Elijah.&#8221;</b><br>The misunderstanding of Jesus' words is significant. The name "Eli" in Aramaic sounds similar to "Elijah," leading some bystanders to think Jesus was calling for the prophet Elijah. In Jewish tradition, Elijah was expected to return before the coming of the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>. This expectation is reflected in the cultural context of the time, where Elijah was seen as a forerunner to the messianic age. The mention of Elijah also connects to the broader theme of prophetic fulfillment in the life and ministry of Jesus. The misunderstanding highlights the spiritual blindness of the people, who fail to recognize Jesus as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is crucified at this point in the Gospel of Matthew.

A mixed crowd has gathered&#8212;Roman soldiers fulfilling their duty, curious passers-by, religious leaders ensuring the execution is carried out, and a few faithful followers standing at a distance. Passers-by jeer just as they had in <a href="/mark/15-29.htm">Mark 15:29-32</a>, while leaders sneer as in <a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>. In the swirl of voices and emotions, the onlookers take center stage for a moment, showing how human reactions to Jesus often expose the state of the heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heard this</b><p>Just before our verse, Jesus has cried out, &#8220;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; echoed from <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>). Those nearby catch the sound but not the sense. Their ears pick up only the syllable &#8220;Eli,&#8221; missing the psalm&#8217;s plea and its profound fulfillment taking place right before them&#8212;much like the crowd in <a href="/john/12-29.htm">John 12:29</a> who mistook the Father&#8217;s voice for thunder. The mishearing reveals spiritual dullness, an inability to discern what God is truly doing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they said</b><p>Instead of pausing to seek understanding, the bystanders quickly trade impressions. The soldiers may speak with a shrug, the leaders with mockery, and the curious with a spark of fascination. <a href="/luke/23-36.htm">Luke 23:36</a> notes that even the soldiers &#8220;came up and mocked Him,&#8221; while <a href="/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40-43</a> records earlier debates about Jesus&#8217; identity. Such talk often shapes public opinion more than truth does; here it sets the stage for yet another misunderstanding around the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He is calling Elijah.&#8221;</b><p>The crowd leaps to a conclusion rooted in Israel&#8217;s expectation that Elijah will precede the Messiah (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>). Hearing &#8220;Eli&#8221; sounds close enough&#8212;so they assume Jesus is summoning the prophet who once &#8220;went up by a whirlwind into heaven&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). Even after Jesus had explained that John the Baptist came &#8220;in the spirit and power of Elijah&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-11.htm">Mark 9:11-13</a>), many clung to the hope that Elijah might still appear in dramatic rescue. Some may speak mockingly, daring Elijah to save this supposed King; others may linger in superstitious curiosity, wondering if a miracle is imminent. Either way, they miss that the true deliverance is happening through the very suffering they misread.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-47.htm">Matthew 27:47</a> captures a moment of partial hearing and hurried speculation. The crowd latched onto one familiar syllable, &#8220;Eli,&#8221; yet overlooked the deeper cry of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and the greater salvation Jesus was accomplishing. Their response exposes hearts unprepared to recognize the Messiah&#8217;s work. By noting their misunderstanding, Scripture urges us to listen carefully, compare what we hear with the whole counsel of God, and see Jesus not as one needing rescue but as the Redeemer who is rescuing us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">This man calleth for Elias.</span>--There is no ground for looking on this as a wilful, derisive misinterpretation. The words may have been imperfectly understood, or some of those who listened may have been Hellenistic Jews. The dominant expectation of the coming of Elijah (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/16-14.htm" title="And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.">Matthew 16:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-10.htm" title="And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?">Matthew 17:10</a>) would predispose men to fasten on the similarity of sound, and the strange unearthly darkness would intensify the feeling that looked for a supernatural manifestation of His presence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Some of them that stood there.</span> These could not have been the Roman soldiers, for they would not have understood the Saviour's language, and could have known nothing about Elias. Edersheim supposes that the guards were provincial soldiers, and not necessarily of Latin extraction. At any rate, the speakers are Jews standing near enough to the cross to catch more or less the words uttered by Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">This man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">he</span>, pointing at him) <span class="cmt_word">calleth for Elias.</span> Whether they wilfully misinterpreted the half-heard cry, "Eli, Eli!" or whether they really misunderstood it, is an undecided question. In the first case, we must suppose that they spoke in cruel mockery - the last of the brutal insults vented on the meek Sufferer. He cannot save himself; he appeals to the old prophet to come to rescue him; was there ever such presumption? There are two considerations which militate against this supposition. The time of ribaldry and abuse is now past; the supernatural darkness has had a calming and terrifying effect; and there is no spirit of mockery left in the awed bystanders. Besides this, it is not likely that Jews, who with all their errors and vices paid an outward respect to holy things, would have presumed to make a play on the sacred name of God. Therefore it is no more reasonable to hold that, misunderstanding Christ's words, they spoke seriously, with some vague, superstitious idea that Elijah might appear at this crisis, and rescue the Sufferer (see ver. 49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#953;&#957;&#8050;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
