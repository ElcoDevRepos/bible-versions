This act of dismissal shows Jesus' authority and compassion, ensuring the people were fed both physically and spiritually before sending them away. It also highlights His understanding of the need for solitude and prayer, setting an example for His disciples and followers.<p><b>He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray</b><br>Mountains in biblical times were often seen as places of divine encounter and revelation. Jesus frequently sought solitude in such places to commune with the Father, demonstrating His dependence on God and the importance of prayer. This act underscores His dual nature as both fully God and fully man, needing time in prayer to align His human will with the divine purpose. It also prefigures the transfiguration, another significant event on a mountain.<p><b>When evening came</b><br>The mention of evening sets the scene for the subsequent events, emphasizing the passage of time and the transition from day to night. In biblical symbolism, evening can represent a time of reflection and preparation for what is to come. It also foreshadows the coming storm on the Sea of Galilee, setting the stage for Jesus' miraculous walk on water.<p><b>He was there alone</b><br>This emphasizes Jesus' intentional solitude, highlighting the importance of withdrawing from the busyness of ministry to seek God's presence. It reflects the biblical principle of finding strength and guidance in quietness and trust. Jesus' solitude also serves as a model for believers to seek personal time with God, away from distractions, to recharge spiritually and gain clarity for their mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted as seeking solitude for prayer, demonstrating His dependence on the Father and His need for spiritual renewal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the ones Jesus sent away.
