The resurrection is a foundational doctrine in Christianity, affirming life after death and the future resurrection of believers. The concept of resurrection is rooted in Old Testament scriptures such as <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, which speak of the dead rising to eternal life. Jesus' own resurrection is the ultimate fulfillment and proof of this doctrine, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>.<p><b>have you not read</b><br>Jesus often used this phrase to challenge the religious leaders' understanding of Scripture. It implies that the answer to their question is already present in the Scriptures they claim to know. This rhetorical question underscores the importance of Scripture as the authoritative source of truth and highlights the leaders' failure to grasp its true meaning. It also emphasizes the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, as Jesus points them back to the writings of Moses.<p><b>what God said to you:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine authority and timeless relevance of Scripture. Jesus refers to God's words as spoken directly to the people, indicating that the Scriptures are not just historical documents but living words with ongoing significance. This aligns with <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, which states that all Scripture is God-breathed. By saying "to you," Jesus personalizes the message, suggesting that God's revelation is intended for all generations, not just the original audience. This also highlights the personal relationship God seeks with His people through His Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Sadducees, who are questioning Him about the resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect during Jesus' time, known for denying the resurrection of the dead.

There are, it need scarcely be said, many passages scattered here and there through the Old Testament (such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as <a href="/context/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25-26</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10-11</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>) in which the hope of immortality, and even of a resurrection, is expressed with greater clearness; but our Lord meets the Sadducees on their own ground, and quotes from the Law which they recognised as of supreme authority. The principle implied in the reasoning is, that the union of the divine Name with that of a man, as in "I am the God of Abraham," involved a relation existing, not in the past only, but when the words were uttered. They meant something more than "I am the God whom Abraham worshipped in the past." But if the relation was a permanent one, then it followed that those whose names were thus joined with the name of God were living and not dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As touching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the resurrection of the dead.</span> Christ, in the second place, shows how these disputants were, ignorant of Scripture. They may have known the letter, they certainly knew nothing of the spirit of the Word of God, its depth and fulness. The key to the interpretation of the Scripture is faith. It is not enough to be acquainted with the literal signification; this is always inadequate, and denotes not the chief matter intended. To know the Scripture, in the sense of Christ, is to have a clear apprehension of its spiritual aspect, to feel and own the moral and mystical bearing of facts and statements, and to recognize that herein lies the real significance of the inspired record. The want of this discernment vitiated the Sadducees' treatment and reception of Holy Writ, and involved them in lamentable error. Christ proceeds to demonstrate how the very Pentateuch (reverenced unquestionably by their party), which they deemed to be entirely silent on the subject of the life of the soul, spoke plainly on this matter to all who had faith to understand and appreciate the words of Divine wisdom. <span class="cmt_word">That which was spoken unto you by God.</span> To our minds Jesus might have adduced stronger arguments from other books of Scripture, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; but the Sadducees had drawn their objection from the Pentateuch, therefore from that section of the Bible he refutes them. To the books of Moses was always made the ultimate appeal in confirmation of doctrine; in the supreme authority of these writings all sects agreed. The utterances of the prophets were explained away as allegorical, poetical, and rhetorical; the plain, historical statements of the Law could not at that time be thus treated. Christ endorses unreservedly the Divine inspiration of the Pentateuch; he intimates that it was the voice of God to all time, and providentially directed to disperse such errors as those now produced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">concerning</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
