Crucifixions were often held in visible locations to serve as a deterrent to others. The people passing by would have been a mix of locals and pilgrims in Jerusalem for Passover, highlighting the public nature of Jesus' execution. This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, which speaks of being scorned by those who see Him.<p><b>heaped abuse on Him</b><br>The act of heaping abuse reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). This abuse was verbal and likely included mocking His claim to be the King of the Jews and the Son of God. The cultural context of honor and shame in the ancient Near East meant that public ridicule was a severe form of humiliation. This moment underscores the depth of Jesus' suffering and the rejection He faced from His own people.<p><b>shaking their heads</b><br>Shaking the head was a gesture of scorn and derision in ancient Jewish culture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a> and <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>. This physical act of mockery signifies disbelief and contempt, emphasizing the rejection of Jesus' messianic claims. It also serves as a type of the suffering servant, a theme prevalent in the prophetic literature, where the righteous suffer unjustly at the hands of the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/passersby.htm">Passersby</a></b><br>These were individuals who were present at the crucifixion of Jesus.
