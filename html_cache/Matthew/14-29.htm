It echoes the call of Jesus to His disciples in other parts of the Gospels, such as when He called them to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). The word "Come" signifies an invitation to step out in faith, leaving behind the safety of the boat, which represents human security and comfort. This moment is a demonstration of Jesus' authority over nature and His ability to empower His followers to do the impossible when they trust in Him. The command also reflects the personal relationship Jesus has with His disciples, as He knows Peter by name and calls him specifically.<p><b>Then Peter got down out of the boat,</b><br>Peter's action of getting out of the boat is significant as it shows his willingness to trust Jesus and take a step of faith. The boat can be seen as a symbol of the church or the community of believers, and Peter's stepping out represents a move from collective security to individual faith. This act is a demonstration of Peter's impulsive nature, which is seen throughout the Gospels, such as when he declares Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>) or when he cuts off the servant's ear in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>). It also foreshadows Peter's role as a leader in the early church, where he would often be the first to act or speak.<p><b>walked on the water,</b><br>Walking on water is a miraculous event that signifies divine power and authority over creation. In the Old Testament, only God is described as having control over the seas (<a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>), and this act by Peter, enabled by Jesus, shows the divine nature of Christ and His ability to share His power with His followers. This miracle is unique to the Gospels and serves as a type of Jesus' own resurrection, where He defies natural laws. It also prefigures the believer's ability to overcome worldly challenges through faith in Christ.<p><b>and came toward Jesus.</b><br>Peter's movement toward Jesus symbolizes the journey of faith, where believers are called to draw closer to Christ. This phrase highlights the importance of keeping one's focus on Jesus, as Peter's subsequent fear and sinking occur when he looks away from Christ and at the storm (<a href="/matthew/14-30.htm">Matthew 14:30</a>). The act of coming toward Jesus is a metaphor for spiritual growth and discipleship, emphasizing the need for continual movement toward a deeper relationship with Him. This journey is echoed in other scriptures that call believers to draw near to God (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>) and to run the race set before them, fixing their eyes on Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs the miracle of walking on water and invites Peter to do the same.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his impulsive nature and strong faith, who steps out of the boat to walk on water toward Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>Represents safety and the familiar, from which Peter steps out in faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_galilee.htm">The Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>The body of water where this miraculous event takes place, known for its sudden storms and unpredictable conditions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_walking_on_water.htm">The Miracle of Walking on Water</a></b><br>A demonstration of Jesus' divine authority over nature and an invitation for Peter to exercise faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_requires_action.htm">Faith Requires Action</a></b><br>Peter's decision to step out of the boat illustrates that faith often requires us to take bold steps beyond our comfort zones.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_jesus.htm">Focus on Jesus</a></b><br>Peter's ability to walk on water depended on his focus on Jesus.

Jesus does not say, &#8220;Try,&#8221; or &#8220;See if you can,&#8221; but simply &#8220;Come&#8221; (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; This single word carries the power and authority of the Lord of creation. When He speaks, His word is sufficient to enable obedience (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s request in the previous verse (&#8220;Lord, if it is You, command me&#8230;&#8221;) meets Christ&#8217;s gracious command. The scene models the way faith begins&#8212;by hearing and responding to the living word of God (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Peter got down out of the boat,</b><p>&#8226; Faith quickly moves from hearing to acting. Peter leaves the relative safety of the boat, much like he once left his fishing nets to follow Christ (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The step requires a willingness to abandon human security. Boats float; people do not. Yet obedience means choosing Jesus over every other safeguard (<a href="/luke/5-5.htm">Luke 5:5-6</a>; <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice that the other disciples remain seated. Scripture highlights Peter&#8217;s initiative, encouraging believers to move when Christ calls&#8212;even if others stay put (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230; walked on the water,</b><p>&#8226; The miracle is not only Jesus&#8217; ability to walk on waves (<a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>) but also His power shared with a believing disciple. What is impossible for man becomes possible with God (<a href="/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a> declares that God &#8220;tramples the waves of the sea.&#8221; Peter now participates in what only God can do, underscoring Christ&#8217;s deity and Peter&#8217;s dependence.<p>&#8226; The moment illustrates living by faith, not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Physical laws hold unless overridden by the Creator; faith accesses that higher authority without nullifying the reality of natural law.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230; and came toward Jesus.</b><p>&#8226; The goal of the journey is not novelty or self-display but nearness to the Lord. True faith always moves us closer to Christ (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; As long as Peter&#8217;s focus remains on Jesus, he is sustained. The subsequent verses show that shifting attention to wind and waves leads to sinking, teaching believers to keep their eyes fixed on Him (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming &#8220;toward Jesus&#8221; foreshadows the disciple&#8217;s lifelong pattern&#8212;again and again, stepping out, overcoming obstacles, and drawing nearer until faith becomes sight (<a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-29.htm">Matthew 14:29</a> reveals that Christ&#8217;s simple command empowers obedient faith. Peter&#8217;s willingness to leave the boat, walk on water, and move toward Jesus shows that when the Lord speaks, He enables what He asks. The verse invites every believer to trust His word, step beyond human security, and keep eyes on Jesus&#8212;experiencing His sustaining power along the way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Come</span>.
