Jerusalem, the city of David, holds significant religious and historical importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. Jesus' entry fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem "gentle and riding on a donkey." This act symbolizes peace, contrasting with a conquering king who would ride a horse. Jesus' entry into Jerusalem marks the beginning of the culmination of His mission on earth, leading to His crucifixion and resurrection.<p><b>the whole city was stirred</b><br>The Greek word used here for "stirred" can also mean "shaken" or "agitated," indicating a significant commotion among the people. This reaction reflects the anticipation and excitement surrounding Jesus, who had gained a reputation as a teacher, healer, and miracle worker. The city's population would have been swelled due to the Passover festival, with pilgrims from all over the region. The stirring of the city also foreshadows the division Jesus' presence would cause, as some would accept Him as the Messiah while others would reject Him.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221;</b><br>This question highlights the mixed understanding and expectations of the people regarding Jesus' identity. Despite His public ministry and the signs He performed, many were still uncertain about who He was. This question echoes the broader theme of the Gospels, which is the revelation of Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah is not immediately recognized by His own people. The inquiry "Who is this?" invites readers to explore the identity of Jesus and His role in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, Jesus is entering Jerusalem, marking the beginning of the events leading to His crucifixion.

On the tenth of this month the Paschal lamb was selected and taken up preparatory to its sacrifice four days after (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). So the true Paschal Lamb now is escorted to the place where alone the Passover could be sacrificed. Taking A.D. to be the date of the Crucifixion, astronomers inform us that in that year the first day of Nisan fell on March 24. Consequently, the tenth would be on Sunday, April 2, and the fourteenth was reckoned item sunset of Thursday, April 6, to the sunset of Friday, April 7 (see on ver. 1, and preliminary note ch. 26.). <span class="cmt_word">Was moved</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">was shaken</span>, as by an earthquake. St. Matthew alone mentions this commotion, though St. John (<a href="/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>) makes allusion to it, when he reports the vindictive exclamation of the Pharisees, "Behold, the world is gone after him!" Jerusalem had been stirred and troubled once before, when the Wise Men walked through the streets, inquiring, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?" (<a href="/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2, 3</a>). But the excitement was far greater now, more general, composed of many different elements. The Romans expected some public rising; the Pharisaical party was aroused to new envy and malice; the Herodians dreaded a possible usurper; but the populace entertained for the moment the idea that their hopes were now fulfilled, that the long desired Messiah had at last appeared, and would lead them to victory. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this?</span> The question may have been put by the strangers who came from all parts of the world to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem, or by the crowds in the streets, when they beheld the unusual procession that was advancing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When [Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
