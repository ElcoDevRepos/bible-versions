The "Lord of the harvest" refers to God, who is sovereign over the spiritual harvest of souls. In biblical times, harvest was a critical period, symbolizing abundance and provision. The imagery of God as the Lord of the harvest underscores His authority and control over the growth and gathering of believers. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, which declares God's ownership of the earth and everything in it.<p><b>therefore, to send out workers</b><br>The call to "send out workers" highlights the need for laborers in the mission field. This reflects the urgency and importance of evangelism and discipleship. The Greek word for "send out" (ekballo) can imply a forceful sending, indicating the necessity of divine empowerment and commissioning. This is consistent with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations. The need for workers is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-15</a>, which discusses the necessity of preachers for people to hear and believe the Gospel.<p><b>into His harvest.</b><br>The phrase "into His harvest" signifies that the mission field belongs to God. The harvest represents the gathering of people into the Kingdom of God, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. In <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, Jesus speaks of the fields being "ripe for harvest," indicating the readiness of people to receive the Gospel. The use of "His" emphasizes God's ownership and the divine nature of the mission. This also connects to the parable of the wheat and the tares in <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>, where the harvest symbolizes the end of the age and the gathering of the righteous. The imagery of harvest is a powerful reminder of the eschatological hope and the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing the need for more workers in the spiritual harvest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' instruction, tasked with the mission of spreading the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_of_the_harvest.htm">Lord of the Harvest</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His sovereignty over the spiritual harvest and His role in sending out workers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest.htm">Harvest</a></b><br>Symbolic of the world and the people who are ready to receive the Gospel message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers.htm">Workers</a></b><br>Those who are called to spread the Gospel and work in God's mission field.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_prayer.htm">The Urgency of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus instructs His followers to pray for more workers, highlighting the importance of prayer in fulfilling God's mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_the_harvest.htm">God's Sovereignty in the Harvest</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the "Lord of the harvest," and it is His work to send out workers.
