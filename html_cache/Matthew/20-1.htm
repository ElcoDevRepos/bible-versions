The "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's sovereign rule and reign, both in the present spiritual sense and the future eschatological fulfillment. Parables about the kingdom often reveal the nature of God's rule and the values of His kingdom, contrasting them with worldly expectations.<p><b>a landowner</b><br>The landowner represents God, who is sovereign and just. In biblical times, landowners were figures of authority and wealth, responsible for managing their estates and hiring laborers. This imagery would resonate with Jesus' audience, who were familiar with agricultural practices and the social dynamics between landowners and workers.<p><b>who went out early in the morning</b><br>The phrase "early in the morning" indicates the diligence and initiative of the landowner. It reflects God's proactive nature in seeking and calling people into His service. In the Jewish context, the workday began at sunrise, around 6 a.m., emphasizing the urgency and importance of the task at hand.<p><b>to hire workers</b><br>Hiring workers signifies God's invitation to individuals to participate in His kingdom work. This reflects the biblical theme of calling and vocation, where God invites people to join in His redemptive mission. The act of hiring also implies a relationship based on agreement and commitment, mirroring the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>for his vineyard</b><br>The vineyard is a common biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) and, by extension, God's kingdom. It symbolizes a place of growth, fruitfulness, and divine care. The imagery of a vineyard suggests the expectation of productivity and the nurturing environment provided by God for His people to flourish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>This is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_landowner.htm">The Landowner</a></b><br>Symbolizes God, who initiates the call to work in His vineyard, representing His sovereign grace and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Often used in Scripture to symbolize Israel or God's people, it represents the sphere of God's work and mission in the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_workers.htm">The Workers</a></b><br>Represent believers or those called to participate in God's work, highlighting the diversity and inclusivity of God's call.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_in_the_morning.htm">Early in the Morning</a></b><br>Indicates the urgency and priority of God's call, emphasizing the importance of responding promptly to His invitation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority, calling us to participate in His work according to His purpose and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_call.htm">Responding to God's Call</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of being attentive and responsive to God's call, as He seeks workers for His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_in_god's_kingdom.htm">Diversity in God's Kingdom</a></b><br>Appreciate the inclusivity of God's call, as He invites people from all walks of life to join in His mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_the_mission.htm">Urgency of the Mission</a></b><br>Understand the urgency of God's work and the need for immediate and wholehearted commitment to His service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>Encourage faithfulness and diligence in serving God, trusting that He will reward according to His grace and justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_20_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 20:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_1_God_s_kingdom_in_life.htm">How does Matthew 20:1 illustrate God's kingdom principles in our daily lives?

The verse assures us of God&#8217;s initiative, ownership, and generosity, preparing our hearts to accept His terms rather than demand our own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">For the kingdom.</span>--The division of the chapter is here singularly unfortunate, as separating the parable both from the events which gave occasion to it and from the teaching which it illustrates. It is not too much to say that we can scarcely understand it at all unless we connect it with the history of the young ruler who had great possessions, and the claims which the disciples had made for themselves when they contrasted their readiness with his reluctance.<p><span class= "bld">To hire labourers into his vineyard.</span>--The framework of the parable brings before us a form of labour in some respects lower than that of the "servants," or "slaves," who formed part of the household, and had been bought or born to their position. The labourers here are the "hired servants" of <a href="/luke/15-17.htm" title="And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!">Luke 15:17</a>, engaged for a time only, and paid by the day. Interpreting the parable, we may see in the householder our Lord Himself. It was indeed a title which He seems to have, as it were, delighted in, and which He applies directly to Himself in <a href="/matthew/10-25.htm" title="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?">Matthew 10:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-27.htm" title="So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did not you sow good seed in your field? from where then has it tares?">Matthew 13:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-52.htm" title="Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.">Matthew 13:52</a>. And the "vineyard" is primarily, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1</a>, the house of Israel, which the Anointed of the Lord had come to claim as His kingdom. The "early morning" answered accordingly to the beginning of our Lord's ministry; the "labourers" He then called were the disciples whom, at the outset of His ministry, He had summoned to follow Him. He had promised them a reward. Though at the best they were unprofitable servants, He yet offered them wages, and the wages were the kingdom of heaven itself (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a>); in other words, "righteousness, and peace, and joy;" in other words, yet again, "eternal life, seeing and knowing God" (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>; <a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). We may trace, I believe, something of a subtle and peculiar fitness in our Lord's choice of this form of labour, as distinct, on the one side, from free and willing service, and, on the other, from the task-work of slaves. It was not in itself the best or most adequate symbol of the relation of the disciples to their Lord, but as their question, "What shall we have, therefore?" implies, it was that on which their minds were dwelling, and therefore He chose it, adapting Himself so far to their weakness, that He might teach them the lesson which they needed. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the labourers in the vineyard</span>.

The following parable is intended to illustrate the apophthegm at the end of the last chapter, which is repeated almost in the same words at the close, "Many that are first," etc., and "The last shall be first," etc. It taught the apostles a lesson in answer to Peter's question (<a href="/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>), "What shall we have therefore?" and the primary lesson was that the reward of the kingdom is not of debt, but of grace.
