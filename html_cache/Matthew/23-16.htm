The term "woe" is an expression of lament and judgment, indicating the seriousness of their spiritual blindness. The leaders are called "blind guides," highlighting their inability to lead the people in truth and righteousness. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a>, where leaders are described as blind watchmen, and it underscores the failure of these leaders to recognize Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>You say, &#8216;If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing;</b><br>Here, Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their flawed teachings regarding oaths. The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and held great significance. However, the Pharisees had developed a system where swearing by the temple was considered non-binding. This reflects a legalistic approach that prioritized technicalities over genuine integrity and truthfulness, contrary to the spirit of the law as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>.<p><b>but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.&#8217;</b><br>The Pharisees taught that swearing by the gold of the temple was binding, which reveals their misplaced priorities. The gold likely refers to the offerings and adornments within the temple, emphasizing material wealth over the sanctity of the temple itself. This reflects a broader theme in Jesus' teachings, where He condemns the prioritization of material wealth over spiritual devotion (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). The focus on gold over the temple itself shows a misunderstanding of what is truly sacred, aligning with Jesus' earlier teachings in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the religious leaders of His time, specifically the Pharisees and scribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders known for their strict adherence to the law and traditions, whom Jesus often criticized for their hypocrisy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where Jews worshiped God, central to Jewish religious life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_of_the_temple.htm">Gold of the Temple</a></b><br>Refers to the offerings and adornments within the temple, which the Pharisees considered more binding in oaths than the temple itself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oaths.htm">Oaths</a></b><br>Promises or vows made invoking something sacred, which were common in Jewish tradition.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_in_leadership.htm">Hypocrisy in Leadership</a></b><br>Jesus condemns the Pharisees for their focus on external rituals over genuine faith.

In effect they were:<p>&#8226; Redefining sin so they could appear righteous.<p>&#8226; Rewriting the rules of worship to suit personal advantage.<p>&#8226; Replacing God&#8217;s authority with their own (<a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>Their words reveal hearts more concerned with appearances than obedience (<a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing;</b><p>According to their casuistry, an oath invoking the temple itself was non-binding.

Such thinking betrays:<p>&#8226; Materialistic idolatry&#8212;prizing riches over relationship with the Lord (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; A backward sense of worth&#8212;the temple sanctifies the gold, not the other way around (<a href="/matthew/23-17.htm">Matthew 23:17</a>).<p>&#8226; A love of self-gain cloaked in piety (<a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>).<p>True worshipers are reminded that the silver and gold belong to God (<a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>) and that redemption was purchased &#8220;not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16</a> exposes religious leaders who, while claiming to guide others, were spiritually blind.

Jesus&#8217; &#8220;woe&#8221; warns every believer to prize God Himself above material wealth, to honor His name with truthful speech, and to reject any tradition that dilutes or contradicts the straightforward commands of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Whosoever shall swear by the temple.</span>--On the general teaching of the Pharisees as to oaths, see Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33-37</a>. It is not easy to trace the currents of thought that run through a corrupt casuistry, but probably the line of reasoning that led to this distinction was that the "gold of the Temple"--not the gold used in its structural ornamentation, but that which in coin or bullion was part of the Corban, or sacred treasure (<a href="/matthew/15-5.htm" title="But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me;">Matthew 15:5</a>)--had received a more special consecration than the fabric, and involved, therefore, a higher obligation, when used as a <span class= "ital">formula jurandi,</span> than the Temple or the altar. Something of the same feeling is seen in the popular casuistry which makes the binding force of an oath depend on "kissing the Book;" or that of mediaeval Christendom, which saw in the relics of a saint that which was more sacred than the Gospels. The principle involved in our Lord's teaching goes further than its immediate application, and sweeps away the arbitrary distinction of different degrees of sanctity in the several parts of the same structure. Here the line of reasoning is, as in <a href="/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, that the Temple includes the altar, that the altar includes the gift, that the heaven includes the Throne, and that thus every oath-formula runs up, explicitly or implicitly, into the great thought of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Fourth woe</span> - against evasive distinctions in oaths. Ye blind guides. They were by profession leaders and guides, and yet by their literalism and externalism they lost the true significance of the Scriptures which they taught, and the ritual of which they were the exponents.

An oath by the temple was not binding; it might be broken or evaded with impunity. <span class="cmt_word">By the gold of the temple -</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the sacred treasure and ornaments therein - <span class="cmt_word">he is a debtor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); he is bound by his oath. The casuistry employed by the Jews in this matter was well known, and had become proverbial among the heathen. F.M. quotes Martial, 11:94 - <p><span class="accented">"Ecce negas, jurasque mihi per templa Tonantis,<br />Non credo: jura, verpe, per Anchialum.'"</span> Anchialum is equivalent to <span class="accented">am chai aloh</span>, "as God liveth," the Jew (<span class="accented">verpus</span>, "circumcised") being bound by no oath but one that contained some letters of the Divine name or some attribute of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
