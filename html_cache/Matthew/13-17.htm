In the Gospels, Jesus often uses "truly" or "verily" to underscore the importance of His teachings. It reflects His role as a divine teacher and prophet, whose words carry the weight of divine truth.<p><b>many prophets and righteous men</b><br>This refers to the faithful individuals in the Old Testament who were devoted to God and His promises. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel, as well as righteous figures such as Abraham and Moses, anticipated the coming of the Messiah. Their lives were marked by a deep longing for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>longed to see what you see</b><br>The prophets and righteous men yearned for the arrival of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom. They foresaw glimpses of this future through prophecies and visions but did not experience it firsthand. This longing is evident in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which speak of the coming of a divine ruler.<p><b>but did not see it</b><br>Despite their anticipation, these figures did not witness the fulfillment of their prophecies. <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a> highlights that many died in faith, not having received the promises but seeing them from afar. This underscores the privilege of those in Jesus' time who witnessed His ministry and the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>and to hear what you hear</b><br>The teachings and parables of Jesus, as well as His proclamation of the Kingdom of God, were revelations that the prophets and righteous men longed to hear. Jesus' words were the culmination of God's communication to humanity, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>, where God speaks through His Son in these last days.<p><b>but did not hear it</b><br>The prophets and righteous men did not have the opportunity to hear Jesus' teachings directly. This highlights the unique blessing and responsibility of those who were present during Jesus' earthly ministry. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of listening to and heeding the words of Christ, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, revealing the privilege they have in witnessing His ministry and teachings firsthand.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah and longed to see the fulfillment of their prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_men.htm">Righteous Men</a></b><br>These are individuals from the Old Testament who lived by faith and desired to witness the coming of God's kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are blessed to see and hear the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teachings, representing God's reign and the fulfillment of His promises through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_privilege_of_revelation.htm">The Privilege of Revelation</a></b><br>Recognize the immense privilege we have in having access to the full revelation of God's plan through Jesus Christ and the Scriptures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/longing_for_fulfillment.htm">Longing for Fulfillment</a></b><br>Understand the deep longing of the prophets and righteous men for the Messiah, and cultivate a similar longing for Christ's return and the full realization of His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_for_spiritual_insight.htm">Gratitude for Spiritual Insight</a></b><br>Be grateful for the spiritual insight and understanding we have through the Holy Spirit, which even the prophets did not fully possess.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_witness.htm">Responsibility of Witness</a></b><br>With the privilege of revelation comes the responsibility to share the gospel and live out its truths in our daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_patience.htm">Faith and Patience</a></b><br>Emulate the faith and patience of the prophets and righteous men, trusting in God's promises even when fulfillment seems distant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Value_Scripture_via_Matthew_13_17.htm">How does Matthew 13:17 encourage us to value our access to Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Prophets_role_in_God_s_timeline.htm">What does "many prophets and righteous men" reveal about God's revelation timeline?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Matthew_13_17_s_truth_today.htm">How can we apply the longing for truth seen in Matthew 13:17 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matt_13_17_Heb_11_13_on_faith.htm">Connect Matthew 13:17 with Hebrews 11:13 on faith and unseen promises.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Matt_13_17_on_spiritual_gratitude.htm">How should Matthew 13:17 influence our gratitude for spiritual insights?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_17_Privilege_of_witnessing_Jesus.htm">What does Matthew 13:17 reveal about the privilege of witnessing Jesus' teachings firsthand?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_17_s_impact_on_prophecy.htm">How does Matthew 13:17 challenge our understanding of prophecy fulfillment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_couldn_t_prophets_see_as_disciples_did.htm">Why were prophets and righteous people unable to see what Jesus' disciples saw, according to Matthew 13:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'overcome_by_the_blood'_mean.htm">What were the teachings of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_meaning_of_god's_mystery.htm">What is the meaning of God's mystery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_david's_vengeance_fit_biblical_ethics.htm">2 Samuel 4:12 -

They saw afar off the glory of the kingdom of the latter days. Each stood, as it were, on a Pisgah height, and looked on the vision of a land which he was not to enter. The words "have not seen them" seem to stand in verbal contradiction with those of <a href="/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day," but it is clear that the difference is simply verbal. There is a joy in looking on the distant prospect which does not exclude, yea, rather implies the desire to reach that which even from afar appears so glorious. The feeling thus described is identical with the "searching diligently" of <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a>, and with the "desire for a better country" of <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For verily</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, note).
