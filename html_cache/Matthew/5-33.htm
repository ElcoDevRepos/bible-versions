The "ancients" refers to the people of Israel in the past, particularly those who received the Law through Moses. This sets the stage for Jesus to address the interpretation and application of the Law that had been passed down through generations. It highlights the oral tradition and the authority of the Law in Jewish culture, emphasizing the importance of understanding the original intent of God's commandments.<p><b>&#8216;Do not break your oath,</b><br>Oaths were a significant part of Jewish life, serving as solemn promises made before God. The Old Testament contains numerous references to the importance of keeping one's word, such as in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>. Breaking an oath was seen as a serious offense, as it not only involved the individual but also invoked God's name, making it a matter of divine accountability. This reflects the cultural and religious emphasis on integrity and truthfulness.<p><b>but fulfill your vows to the Lord.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase underscores the obligation to honor commitments made to God. Vows were voluntary promises that, once made, were binding and required fulfillment. The emphasis here is on the sincerity and faithfulness expected in one's relationship with God. This teaching aligns with passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making hasty vows. It also foreshadows Jesus' later teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, where He calls for a deeper righteousness that goes beyond mere external compliance to the Law, pointing to the heart's intent and the ultimate fulfillment of the Law in Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a foundational teaching of Christian ethics and morality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ancients.htm">The Ancients</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel in the Old Testament times who received the Law through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus taught His disciples and the crowds about the Kingdom of Heaven and righteous living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_moses.htm">The Law of Moses</a></b><br>The original context of the teaching, which included commandments about making and keeping oaths.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>The Jewish people who were familiar with the Old Testament laws and traditions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_speech.htm">Integrity in Speech</a></b><br>Jesus calls His followers to be people of their word.

Here, again, the reference is to the letter of the Law as taught by the Rabbis, who did not go beyond it to its wider spirit. To them the Third Commandment was simply a prohibition of perjury, as the Sixth was of murder, or the Seventh of adultery. They did not see that the holy name (<a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a>) might be profaned in other ways, even when it was not uttered; and they expressly or tacitly allowed (See Philo, <span class= "ital">De Special. Legg.</span>) many forms of oath in which it was not named, as with the view of guarding it from desecration. Lastly, out of the many forms thus sanctioned (as here and in <a href="/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>) they selected some as binding, and others as not binding, and thus by a casuistry at once subtle, irrational, and dishonest, tampered with men's sense of truthfulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-37.</span> - <span class="accented">Oaths.</span> Matthew only; but cf. <a href="/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-22</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By them of old time</span> (ver. 21, note). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not forswear thyself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>).
