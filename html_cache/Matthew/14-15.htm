Evening in Jewish culture marks the transition from day to night, a time for rest and reflection. In the context of Jesus' ministry, evening often signifies a moment of deeper teaching or miraculous intervention, as seen in other instances where Jesus performs miracles or teaches profound truths during this time.<p><b>the disciples came to Him and said</b><br>The disciples frequently approached Jesus with concerns or questions, reflecting their role as learners and followers. This interaction highlights their dependence on Jesus for guidance and solutions, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels. It also underscores the developing relationship between Jesus and His disciples, where they are learning to trust in His provision and wisdom.<p><b>This is a desolate place</b><br>The setting is significant, as it emphasizes the isolation and lack of resources available. Desolate places in Scripture often serve as settings for divine encounters and miracles, such as the Israelites receiving manna in the wilderness. This phrase sets the stage for a miraculous provision, drawing a parallel to God's provision in the Old Testament.<p><b>and the hour is already late</b><br>The mention of time underscores the urgency of the situation. In a cultural context where travel and commerce were limited to daylight hours, the lateness of the hour would have heightened the disciples' concern for the crowd's well-being. This detail adds to the narrative tension, setting up the need for a miraculous solution.<p><b>Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages</b><br>The disciples' suggestion reflects a practical approach to the problem, relying on human means to address the crowd's needs. This request also highlights their limited understanding of Jesus' ability to provide supernaturally. The mention of villages indicates the rural setting and the reliance on nearby communities for sustenance.<p><b>and buy themselves some food</b><br>This phrase points to the disciples' concern for the physical needs of the crowd, a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry. It also reflects the economic practices of the time, where buying food was a common necessity. The suggestion to buy food contrasts with the miraculous provision that Jesus is about to demonstrate, highlighting the difference between human and divine solutions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the passage, performing miracles and teaching the crowds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who are concerned about the practical needs of the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>- Large groups of people who have followed Jesus to a remote location to hear His teachings and witness His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/desolate_place.htm">Desolate Place</a></b><br>- A remote area where Jesus and the crowd have gathered, emphasizing the lack of resources and the need for divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>- The time of day, indicating urgency as the day is ending and the need for food becomes pressing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_over_convenience.htm">Compassion Over Convenience</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the disciples' suggestion to send the crowd away teaches us to prioritize compassion over convenience.

(1.) It is the only miracle recorded by all the four Evangelists, and thus is practically one of the chief data for interweaving the supplemental narrative of St. John with that of the other three. (2.) It was the fullest manifestation of the sovereignty of the Son of Man over the world of nature. The act was distinctly, if we accept the facts of the case, one of creative power, and does not admit. as some of the works of healing might seem to do, of being explained away as the result of strong faith or excited imagination on the part of those who were its objects. The only rationalising explanation which has ever been offered--viz., that our Lord by His example, in offering the five loaves and the two fishes for the use of others than His own company of the Twelve, stirred the multitude to bring out the little store which, till then, each man in his selfish anxiety had kept concealed--is ludicrously inadequate. The narrative must be accepted or rejected as a whole; and if accepted, it is, as we have said, a proof of supernatural, if not absolutely of divine, power. (3.) No narrative of any other miracle offers so many marks of naturalness, both in the vividness of colouring with which it is told, and the coincidences, manifestly without design, which it presents to us. It is hardly possible to imagine four independent writers--independent, even if two of them were derived from a common source--reproducing, in this way, a mere legend. (4.) The nature of this evidence will be seen in all its strength by combining the facts of the four records as we proceed. (5.) The miracle was important, as we see from John 6, on account of its dogmatic symbolism. It became the text of the dialogue at Capernaum in which (not to anticipate the Notes on the fourth Gospel) communion with the life of Christ was shadowed forth under the figure of eating the flesh of Him who is the true Bread from heaven.<p><span class= "bld">His disciples came to him.</span>--In St. John's narrative, Philip and Andrew are prominent as speakers, and our Lord puts to the former the question, "Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?" As Philip and Andrew both belonged to one of the Bethsaidas, their local knowledge made the question natural. It was apparently after this private conversation that the main body of the disciples came to their Master beseeching Him to dismiss the multitude that they might buy food in the nearest villages. They were met by what must have seemed to them the marvellous calmness of the answer: "They need not depart, give ye them to eat." Philip's rough estimate having been passed on to the others, they answer that it would take two hundred pennyworth of bread (the Roman penny, as a coin, was worth 7&#171;d<span class= "ital">.</span> of our money, but its value is better measured by its being the average day's wages of a soldier or labourer, <a href="/matthew/20-2.htm" title="And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:2</a>) to feed so great a number (<a href="/mark/6-37.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Give you them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?">Mark 6:37</a>; <a href="/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7</a>). Then Jesus asks them, "How many loaves have ye?" and Andrew (<a href="/john/6-8.htm" title="One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,">John 6:8</a>), as the spokesman of the others, replies that they have found a lad with five loaves (barley loaves, in St. John, the food of the poor) and two fishes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when it was evening.</span> But not as late as the "evening" of ver. 23.
