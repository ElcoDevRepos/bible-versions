The question reflects a common Jewish understanding of the time that eternal life could be earned through good works. Jesus challenges this notion by redirecting the focus from human deeds to the nature of goodness itself. This question also serves to highlight the deeper issue of understanding who Jesus is, as He is the embodiment of divine goodness.<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>This indicates a direct response from Jesus, emphasizing His authority and wisdom. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses questions to provoke deeper reflection and understanding. His reply is not just an answer but an invitation to consider the true nature of goodness and the source of eternal life.<p><b>&#8220;There is only One who is good.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus points to God as the ultimate standard of goodness. This statement aligns with the Jewish Shema, a central declaration of faith in one God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). It underscores the belief that true goodness originates from God alone, contrasting with human attempts to define or achieve goodness independently. This also subtly affirms Jesus' divinity, as He later reveals Himself as one with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).<p><b>If you want to enter life,</b><br>The phrase "enter life" refers to eternal life, a concept deeply rooted in Jewish eschatology. Eternal life is not just a future promise but a present reality that begins with a relationship with God. Jesus emphasizes that entering life is not merely about following rules but involves a transformative relationship with God.<p><b>keep the commandments.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus refers to the commandments given in the Torah, which were central to Jewish life and practice. By instructing the young man to keep the commandments, Jesus acknowledges their importance but also sets the stage for revealing the limitations of the law in achieving righteousness. This points to the necessity of faith and grace, themes further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20-24</a>). Jesus fulfills the law and offers a new covenant, inviting believers to follow Him as the way to eternal life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question about what is good, emphasizing the nature of goodness and the importance of the commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rich_young_ruler.htm">Rich Young Ruler</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context involves a wealthy young man seeking eternal life, prompting Jesus' response.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/commandments.htm">Commandments</a></b><br>Refers to the laws given by God, particularly those found in the Old Testament, which Jesus highlights as essential for entering life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The ultimate goal of the rich young ruler's inquiry, representing salvation and life with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Referred to as the "One who is good," emphasizing the divine standard of goodness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_goodness.htm">Understanding True Goodness</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that only God is truly good, challenging us to recognize our need for divine grace and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_commandments.htm">The Role of the Commandments</a></b><br>Keeping the commandments is essential for entering life, highlighting the importance of obedience in the Christian walk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_eternal_life.htm">The Nature of Eternal Life</a></b><br>Eternal life is not just about following rules but involves a relationship with God, who is the source of all goodness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-reflection_on_goodness.htm">Self-Reflection on Goodness</a></b><br>We are called to examine our own lives in light of God's standard of goodness, recognizing our shortcomings and need for a Savior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_discipleship.htm">The Call to Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus' response invites us to a deeper commitment to following Him, beyond mere rule-keeping, to a life transformed by His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_19_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 19:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_19_17_Importance_of_God_s_laws.htm">How does Matthew 19:17 emphasize the importance of obeying God's commandments today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_One_who_is_good_reveal.htm">What does "there is only One who is good" reveal about God's nature?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Jesus_goodness_daily.htm">How can we apply Jesus' teaching on goodness in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_OT_laws_align_with_Matthew_19_17.htm">Which Old Testament commandments align with Jesus' message in Matthew 19:17?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_goodness_on_relationships_2.htm">How does understanding God's goodness influence our relationship with Him and others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_reject_being_called_good.htm">Why does Jesus question being called "good" in Matthew 19:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Does_Matt_19_17_question_human_goodness.htm">How does Matthew 19:17 challenge the concept of inherent human goodness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_19_17_God_s_nature_and_goodness.htm">What does Matthew 19:17 imply about the nature of God and goodness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'overcome_by_the_blood'_mean.htm">What were the teachings of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_abolish_the_law.htm">Did Jesus come to abolish the law?

Jesus immediately questions his premise, making the man think about the source and definition of &#8220;good.&#8221;<p>- By asking this counter-question, Jesus guides the seeker away from a works-based checklist and toward God&#8217;s standard (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>- <a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17-18</a> and <a href="/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18-19</a> record the same encounter; in each account Jesus places the spotlight on God, not human effort.<p>- The question also presses the listener to recognize Jesus&#8217; own authority.

Scripture affirms His sinlessness (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) and unity with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>; 14:9).

There is One that is the Good." The alteration was probably made, as before, for the sake of agreement with the other Gospels. In either case the answer has the same force. The questioner had lightly applied the word "good" to One whom he as yet regarded only as a human teacher, to an act which, it seemed to him, was in his own power to perform. What he needed, therefore, was to be taught to deepen and widen his thoughts of goodness until they rose to Him in whom alone it was absolute and infinite, through fellowship with whom only could any teacher rightly be called good, and from whom alone could come the power to do any good thing. The method by which our Lord leads him to that conclusion may, without irreverence, be permitted to call up the thought of the method in which Socrates is related to have dealt with like questioners, both in the grave, sad irony of the process, and in the self-knowledge in which it was designed to issue.<p><span class= "bld">Keep the commandments.</span>--The questioner is answered as from his own point of view. If eternal life was to be won by doing, there was no need to come to a new Teacher for a new precept. It was enough to keep the commandments, the great moral laws of God, as distinct from ordinances and traditions (<a href="/matthew/15-3.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?">Matthew 15:3</a>), with which every Israelite was familiar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why callest thou me good?</span> Such is the reading of the received text here, and without any variation in the parallel passages of Mark and Luke. Our Lord takes the ruler to task for applying this epithet to him. unless the youth believed in his Divinity. You think of me only as a learned Teacher: how, then, can you speak of me in a term which can really be predicated of no child of man? Christ answers the ruler's address before he touches the subject of his interrogation, reproving him for using a form of words without realizing its full import. This is all plain enough; but many good manuscripts, including <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> B, D, etc., Vulgate, and other versions, read, <span class="accented">Why askest thou me concerning the good?</span> Most modern editors and the Revised Version have adopted this reading, which they hold to be genuine, and to have been altered subsequently in order to conform it to the other synoptists. If this is so, it is difficult to see whence Mark and Luke obtained their wording, unless - which is improbable - our Lord used both interrogations on the same occasion. The revised reading expresses Christ's astonishment at having this question asked; and it may be taken, as Bengel suggests, "He who is good ought to be interrogated about the good;" or, "What is right to do, you ought to know; it can only be obedience to the Author of all goodness." There is <span class="cmt_word">none good but one</span>, that is, <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. Here again the reading varies. The other synoptists agree with the received text of Matthew, except that Luke has <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Late editors, following <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, etc., have printed, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">one there is who is good</span>, or <span class="accented">one is the good</span>. God alone is the absolutely good; he alone can instruct you and put you certainly in the right way. Persons have been found to argue from this sentence that Christ renounces all claim to be God Almighty. But it is not so. He replies to what was in the young man's mind. The ruler regarded Jesus as man only; Jesus intimates that, in comparison with God, no man is good. He does not deny the applicability of the epithet to himself, but turns the questioner's thoughts to the Source of all good. He will not have himself regarded simply as a pre-eminently good man, but as Son of God, one with the Father. <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">willest to</span>) enter into life; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. enjoy eternal life. Christ uses a term equivalent to that of the ruler in ver. 16. So Christ said on another occasion to a lawyer who tempted him. "This do, and thou shalt live" (<a href="/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>). There is no real life without obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Keep the commandments</span> of him who is good. The Law was given to prepare men to receive Christianity, and in proportion as they carefully observed it, so were they made ready to inherit the life which Christ gives. No mere external compliance without faith is here approved, but it is laid down that, in order to win eternal life, there must be strict observance of God's laws - not some one extraordinary performance, but constant attention to known duties from the highest motive. Faith, indeed, is belief in action, and is dead and profitless if inoperative; so that true obedience is the outcome of true faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
