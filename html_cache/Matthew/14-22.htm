The word "immediately" suggests a swift transition from the previous events, where Jesus had just performed the miracle of feeding the 5,000. Jesus' directive to the disciples to get into the boat underscores His role as a leader and teacher, guiding them even when they may not understand the full purpose. This action can be seen as a test of obedience and faith, as the disciples are sent ahead without Jesus, who remains behind.<p><b>and go on ahead of Him to the other side</b><br>The "other side" refers to the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, a region known for its mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. This journey across the sea can symbolize the mission of the disciples to spread the Gospel beyond Jewish territories, foreshadowing the Great Commission. The Sea of Galilee itself is a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often serving as a backdrop for His teachings and miracles.<p><b>while He dismissed the crowds</b><br>Jesus' decision to dismiss the crowds personally shows His compassion and care for the people, ensuring they are sent away peacefully after being fed. This act also reflects His desire for solitude and prayer, as He often withdrew to pray after significant events.

It led those who witnessed it to the conclusion that "this was the Prophet that should come into the world." They sought to seize Him and make Him a king against His will (<a href="/context/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14-15</a>), and He, shrinking from that form of sovereignty, withdrew from His disciples, dismissed the multitude, and on the mountain height passed the night in prayer. The disciples at His bidding were crossing to the other side to Bethsaida (<a href="/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to the town of that name on the western shore of the lake near Capernaum (<a href="/john/6-17.htm" title="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.

It was, we may reverently say, as if in this unwonted stir of popular excitement--not against Him, but in His favour--this nearness to a path of earthly greatness instead of that which led onward to the cross, He saw something like a renewal of the temptation in the wilderness, needing special communion with His Father, that He might once again resist and overcome it. And once again, therefore, He desired to pass through the conflict alone, as afterwards in Gethsemane, with no human eye to witness the temptation or the victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-33.</span> - Christ's power over the elements. He walks on the water and stays the storm. St. Peter's attempt to walk on the water is successful so long as he exercises faith on Christ. Jesus receives homage as Messiah. Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45-52</a>; <a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15-21</a>. It is strange that the incident of St. Peter is recorded in Matthew only, and not in Mark, for it serves to emphasize what is a leading thought of the preceding narrative, even in Mark, viz. the power that believers receive by virtue of faith on Christ (vers. 16, 19). With Christ in the boat, difficulties cease (ver. 32); they that believe on him can triumph as he did (vers. 28-31; cf. the thought of <a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>, end). For St. John's purpose the mention of St. Peter was not necessary; since, by way of introduction to the following discourse, be desired rather to familiarize his readers with the idea of Christ's body being triumphant over earthly limitations (cf. ver. 19, note). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples.</span> It was not their wish to leave him, especially when the multitudes seemed likely to elect him king (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). But from the temptation to side with the multitudes our Lord desired now to shield them. Separation and physical work (ver. 24) would calm their excitement, and the object lesson that their Master already ruled over wind and sea would lead them to more perfect trust in his methods. Another reason for his sending them forward may have been that they should use the failing light; and yet another, that he himself desired time for prayer. <span class="cmt_word">To get into a ship;</span> <span class="accented">a boat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a> (<span class="accented">the boat</span>, Revised Version, reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And to go before him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="/matthew/2-9.htm">Matthew 2:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>).
