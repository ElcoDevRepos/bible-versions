The high priest's action here signifies his outrage and perceived sacrilege. According to Levitical law, the high priest was not supposed to tear his garments (<a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>), indicating the severity of the situation in his eyes. This act underscores the gravity of the accusation against Jesus and the high priest's belief that a significant religious violation had occurred.<p><b>and declared, &#8220;He has blasphemed!</b><br>Blasphemy, in Jewish law, was a serious offense, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The high priest accuses Jesus of blasphemy because Jesus claimed a divine status, which the religious leaders considered a direct affront to God. This accusation is central to the trial and crucifixion narrative, as it provides the religious leaders with a legal basis to seek the death penalty under Jewish law.<p><b>Why do we need any more witnesses?</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests that the high priest believes the evidence against Jesus is conclusive. Earlier in the chapter, false witnesses were brought forward, but their testimonies did not agree (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-60</a>). The high priest's statement implies that Jesus' own words are sufficient for conviction, bypassing the need for further testimony.<p><b>Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.</b><br>The high priest appeals to the council, emphasizing that they have all heard Jesus' claim, which he interprets as blasphemous. This collective hearing is crucial for the Sanhedrin's decision-making process, as it involves the consensus of the religious leaders. The statement also highlights the tension between Jesus' identity and the religious leaders' understanding of the Messiah, as they fail to recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies (Isaiah 53, <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest at the time was Caiaphas, who presided over the Sanhedrin.

The verse exposes human rebellion against God&#8217;s Messiah while moving God&#8217;s redemptive plan forward: the innocent Lamb must be delivered to die, exactly as Scripture foretold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(65) <span class= "bld">Then the high priest rent his clothes.</span>--The act was almost as much a formal sign of condemnation as the putting on of the black cap by an English judge. The judges in a Jewish trial for blasphemy were bound to rend their clothes in twain when the blasphemous words were uttered, and the clothes so torn were never afterwards to be mended. In <a href="/acts/14-14.htm" title="Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,">Acts 14:14</a> the same act appears, on the part of Paul and Barnabas, as the expression of an impulsive horror, as it had done of old when Eliakim rent his clothes on hearing the blasphemies of Rabshaken (<a href="/2_kings/18-37.htm" title="Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.">2Kings 18:37</a>). A comparison of the Greek word here and in <a href="/mark/14-63.htm" title="Then the high priest rent his clothes, and said, What need we any further witnesses?">Mark 14:63</a> shows that it included the tunic or under-garment as well as the cloak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high priest rent his clothes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). His outer garments, not his pontifical vestment, which he would not wear on this occasion. St. Mark notes that he rent his under clothes, his tunic; so probably he tore both outer and inner garments. This was done in assumed horror at Christ's blasphemy (cf. <a href="/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>), rabbinical injunctions requiring such an action, and prescribing the nature, extent, and direction of the scissure. "This he did," says Chrysostom, "to add force to the accusation, and to increase the weight of his words by the act." His assessors, though fully agreeing with him, appear not to have followed his example in this particular, taking the high priest's action as typical and sufficiently expressive of the general sentiment. The Fathers see in it a symbol of the rending and destruction of the Jewish priesthood (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27, 28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">spoken blasphemy</span>.
