In ancient cultures, sitting at the right hand of a king was a position of privilege. Here, the King refers to Jesus Christ, who is depicted as the ultimate judge and ruler. This scene is part of the parable of the sheep and the goats, illustrating the final judgment. The "right" signifies those who are righteous and have lived according to God's will.<p><b>&#8216;Come, you who are blessed by My Father</b><br>The invitation to "come" signifies acceptance and welcome into eternal life. Being "blessed by My Father" indicates divine favor and approval. This blessing is not earned by works but is a result of God's grace. The Father&#8217;s blessing is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the relationship between God and His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, where believers are blessed with every spiritual blessing in Christ.<p><b>inherit the kingdom prepared for you</b><br>The concept of inheritance implies a gift that is passed down, not something earned. This kingdom is a divine inheritance promised to believers, aligning with the biblical theme of believers as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). The kingdom is not a new creation but has been prepared, indicating God's eternal plan and purpose for His people.<p><b>from the foundation of the world</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal nature of God's plan. It reflects the biblical teaching that God's purposes and plans are established from the beginning of time, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, which speaks of God choosing believers before the foundation of the world.

He publicly affirms their favored status, rooted in the Father&#8217;s eternal plan and evidenced by lives of obedient love. The invitation to &#8220;come&#8221; rests on divine grace, leading believers to inherit a kingdom prepared before time began&#8212;underscoring both God&#8217;s sovereignty and the secure hope of all who trust in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Ye blessed of my Father.</span>--The Greek is not identical with "blessed <span class= "ital">by</span> my Father," but means rather, "ye blessed ones who <span class= "ital">belong to</span> my Father."<p><span class= "bld">Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</span>--Yes; not for Israel only, or those among the brethren who should in this life believe in Christ, had the kingdom been prepared, but for these also.

How the sight and hearing of this first sentence must awake the remorse of the reprobate! Come. He calls them to be by his side, to share his kingdom and glory (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>). Ancient commentators have tenderly expanded this invitation, conceiving it addressed individually to patriarch, prophet, apostle, martyr, saint; others have paraphrased it in affecting terms: "Come from darkness to light, from bondage to the liberty of God's children, from about to perpetual rest, from war to peace, from death to life, from the company of the evil to the fellowship of angels, from conflict to triumph, from daily temptation and trial to stable and eternal felicity." <span class="cmt_word">Ye blessed of</span> (equivalent to by) <span class="cmt_word">my Father.</span> So <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "taught of [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by] God" (<a href="/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>). They were beloved by God, and were to be rewarded by the gift of eternal life. This was their blessing (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). Nothing is said about election or predestination, as if they were saved because they were blessed by the Father. There is a sense in which this is true; but they were rewarded, not because of their election, but because they used the grace given to them, and cooperated with the Holy Spirit which they received. <span class="cmt_word">Inherit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">receive as your lot</span>).

'For, before you were,' saith he, 'these things had been prepared, and made ready for you, forasmuch as I knew you would be such as you are '" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). Christians are by baptism made in heritors of the kingdom of heaven, gifted with heavenly citizenship, which, duly used, leads to eternal glory.
