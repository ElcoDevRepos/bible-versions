In the Jewish tradition, prayer was a daily practice, with set times and specific prayers. Jesus emphasizes the importance of sincere communication with God, contrasting with the ritualistic and often mechanical prayers of the time. This phrase sets the stage for a teaching on the nature of true prayer, which is not about formality but about heartfelt communication with the Father.<p><b>do not babble on like pagans</b><br>The term "babble" refers to the repetitive and meaningless words often used in pagan prayers. In the Greco-Roman world, it was common for pagans to use long, elaborate prayers to invoke their gods, believing that the quantity of words would ensure they were heard. This practice was rooted in the belief that the gods needed to be persuaded or manipulated through persistent and verbose speech. Jesus warns against adopting such practices, emphasizing that God is not like the pagan deities who require persuasion.<p><b>for they think that by their many words</b><br>This phrase highlights the misconception that the effectiveness of prayer is dependent on its length or complexity. In the cultural context of the time, many believed that the more words used, the more likely the prayer would be answered. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's nature, suggesting that He is distant or inattentive. Jesus corrects this view by teaching that God is a loving Father who knows the needs of His children even before they ask.<p><b>they will be heard</b><br>The desire to be heard is a fundamental aspect of prayer. In the ancient world, being heard by the gods was often seen as a matter of chance or manipulation. However, Jesus assures His followers that God is attentive and responsive to sincere prayers. This assurance is rooted in the character of God as revealed throughout Scripture, where He is depicted as a God who listens and responds to His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>).

Formed from a word which reproduces the repeated attempts of the stammerer to clothe his thoughts in words, it might be almost rendered, "Do not stutter out your prayers, do not babble them over." The words describe only too faithfully the act of prayer when it becomes mechanical. The devotion of the rosary, in which every bead is connected with a Pater Noster or an Ave Maria, does but reproduce the eighteen prayers of the Rabbis, which they held it to be an act of religion to repeat. On the other hand, it is clear that the law of Christ does not exclude the iteration of intense emotion. That is not a "vain repetition;" and in the great crisis of His human life our Lord Himself prayed thrice "using the same words" (<a href="/matthew/26-44.htm" title="And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.">Matthew 26:44</a>). How far our use of the Lord's Prayer, or of the Kyrie Eleison of our Litanies, is open to the charge of "vain repetition" is another question. It is obvious that it may easily become so to any mechanical worshipper of the Pharisaic type; but there is, on the other side, an ever-accumulating weight of evidence from really devout souls, that they have found it helpful in sustaining the emotion without which prayer is dead.<p><span class= "bld">As the heathen do.</span>--We know too little of the details of the ritual of classical heathenism to be able to say how far the charge of vain repetition applied at this time to them. The cries of the worshippers of Baal "from morning even until noon" (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm" title="And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped on the altar which was made.">1Kings 18:26</a>), the shouts of those of Artemis at Ephesus "for the space of two hours" (<a href="/acts/19-34.htm" title="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:34</a>), may be taken as representative instances.<p><span class= "bld">Their much speaking.</span>--This thought was the root-evil of the worship of the heathen or the Pharisee. It gave to prayer a quantitative mechanical force, increased in proportion to the number of prayers offered. If fifty failed, a hundred might succeed. But this assumed that the object of prayer was to change the will of God, or to inform Him of what He did not know before, and our Lord teaches us--as, indeed, all masters of the higher life have taught--that that assumption vitiates prayer at once.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye pray</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The Revised Version, <span class="accented">and in praying</span>, shows that our Lord is only continuing the subject, and not turning to a new one, as in vers. 2, 5, 16.
