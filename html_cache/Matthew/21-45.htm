The chief priests were part of the temple hierarchy, responsible for temple rituals and sacrifices, while the Pharisees were a sect known for their strict adherence to the Law and oral traditions. Jesus often used parables, which are simple stories with spiritual or moral lessons, to convey deeper truths. In the context of <a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a>, Jesus had just told the Parable of the Tenants, which was a direct critique of the religious leaders' failure to lead Israel faithfully. This setting is significant as it takes place in Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life, during the final week of Jesus' earthly ministry.<p><b>they knew that Jesus was speaking about them</b><br>The religious leaders' realization that Jesus was speaking about them indicates their understanding of the parables' implications. The parables were not just stories but were prophetic and confrontational, revealing the leaders' rejection of God's messengers and ultimately His Son. This awareness highlights their hardened hearts and unwillingness to repent despite recognizing the truth. The parables served as a mirror, reflecting their spiritual condition and the impending judgment. This moment foreshadows the growing tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, which would culminate in His crucifixion. The leaders' recognition of Jesus' message also fulfills the prophetic nature of His ministry, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people's inability to perceive and understand is foretold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in charge of temple worship and sacrifices.
