The "thorns" symbolize obstacles and distractions that prevent spiritual growth. In ancient Palestine, thorns and weeds were common in fields, representing the challenges farmers faced. Spiritually, these thorns represent worldly concerns that can entangle a believer, preventing the seed of the Word from taking root and flourishing.<p><b>is the one who hears the word</b><br>Hearing the word signifies receiving the message of the Gospel. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, oral tradition was a primary means of communication, and hearing was often the first step in learning and understanding. This phrase emphasizes that the individual has been exposed to the truth of the Gospel, highlighting the initial acceptance or acknowledgment of the message.<p><b>but the worries of this life</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the everyday concerns and anxieties that can dominate a person's thoughts. In the historical context, life in first-century Judea was fraught with political instability, economic hardship, and social pressures. These worries can distract believers from focusing on spiritual matters, illustrating how temporal concerns can overshadow eternal truths.<p><b>and the deceitfulness of wealth</b><br>Wealth is portrayed as deceitful because it can create a false sense of security and self-sufficiency. In biblical times, as today, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's favor, yet Jesus warns that it can lead to spiritual complacency. This connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which warns that the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where Jesus states that one cannot serve both God and money.<p><b>choke the word</b><br>The imagery of choking suggests a violent suppression of growth. Just as thorns can physically strangle a plant, worldly concerns and the pursuit of wealth can stifle spiritual development. This metaphor highlights the destructive power of these distractions, preventing the Word from thriving in a believer's life.<p><b>and it becomes unfruitful</b><br>Fruitfulness is a common biblical metaphor for spiritual growth and productivity. In <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, Jesus describes Himself as the vine and His followers as branches, emphasizing the importance of remaining in Him to bear fruit. The lack of fruitfulness here indicates a failure to live out the Gospel's transformative power, resulting in a life that does not reflect the values and virtues of the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about the Kingdom of Heaven through parables to His disciples and the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Represents anyone who spreads the Word of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seed.htm">The Seed</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Word of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thorns.htm">The Thorns</a></b><br>Represent the worries of life and the deceitfulness of wealth that choke the Word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience listening to Jesus' parables, including His disciples and others gathered around Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_distractions.htm">The Danger of Distractions</a></b><br>The thorns symbolize distractions that can prevent spiritual growth.

He is showing how the life-giving Word of God lands in a heart that already holds competing growth&#8212;worldly cares and desires. Thorns do not represent mere inconveniences; they are living rivals that drain soil of nutrients, light, and space. If we allow thorns to remain, they will certainly crowd out the seed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is the one who hears the word</b><p>The person described genuinely &#8220;hears&#8221; the gospel. Faith &#8220;comes by hearing&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), but hearing alone is not the finish line. James warns us not to be &#8220;hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>). In <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a> Jesus calls every church, &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear.&#8221; Hearing is the doorway; obedience is the pathway. This listener stands at the doorway but never moves forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the worries of this life</b><p>Everyday pressures&#8212;bills, family health, job security&#8212;can loom larger than God&#8217;s promises. Jesus already cautioned, &#8220;Do not worry about your life&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>). Paul echoes, &#8220;Do not be anxious about anything&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>). When worries dominate, we risk treating God&#8217;s Word as background noise. Casting those cares on Him (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>) keeps the soil clear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the deceitfulness of wealth</b><p>Wealth whispers lies: &#8220;You&#8217;re safe, you&#8217;re significant, you&#8217;re satisfied.&#8221; Scripture unmasks the illusion: &#8220;Those who want to be rich fall into temptation&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>), and &#8220;command the rich not to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a> says, &#8220;He who trusts in his riches will fall.&#8221; Money itself is not evil; its seduction is. When pursuit of riches eclipses pursuit of righteousness, thorns tighten.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Choke the word</b><p>Thorns don&#8217;t rip out the seed; they simply smother it. Slow, steady pressure squeezes off light and moisture until the plant gasps. In spiritual terms the Word loses active influence&#8212;the Spirit&#8217;s gentle promptings are muted (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>). <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a> urges us to &#8220;lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily entangles,&#8221; because entanglements strangle growth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And it becomes unfruitful</b><p>Lack of visible fruit reveals an inner problem. Jesus said, &#8220;Every branch that does not bear fruit He takes away&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>) and &#8220;apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>). Genuine fruit&#8212;Christlike character, good works, souls reached&#8212;should mark believers (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="/titus/3-14.htm">Titus 3:14</a>). When thorns dominate, fruit withers, leaving profession without productivity (<a href="/2_peter/1-8.htm">2 Peter 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a> warns that a heart can welcome the Word yet let daily anxieties and the lure of riches grow unchecked. These thorns quietly suffocate spiritual life until no lasting fruit appears. The remedy is active: uproot cares by trusting God, expose wealth&#8217;s lies by treasuring Christ, and keep the soil of the heart clear so the Word can flourish and bear enduring fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">He also that received seed among the thorns.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/13-19.htm" title="When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.">Matthew 13:19</a>. Here there is no over-rapid growth, and there is some depth of earth. The character is not one that wastes its strength in vague emotions, but has the capacity for sustained effort. The evil here is, that while there is strength of purpose, there is not unity of spirit. The man is double-minded, and would fain serve two masters. The "care of this world" (the word is the root of the verb "take no thought" in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25</a>), the deceitfulness of earthly riches--cheating the soul with its counterfeit shows of good--these choke the "word" in its inner life, and it becomes "unfruitful." There may be some signs of fruitfulness, perhaps the "blade" and the "ear" of partial reformation and strivings after holiness, but there is no "full corn in the ear." In St. Luke's words, such men "bring no fruit to perfection" (<a href="/luke/8-14.htm" title="And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.">Luke 8:14</a>). To the simpler root-forms of evil in St. Matthew, St. Mark adds "the lusts (or desires) about other things"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the things that are other than the true life--and St. Luke, "the pleasures of life" to which wealth ministers, and for the sake of which, therefore, men pursue it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the care</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Of this world (</span><span class="accented">of the world</span>, Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, omitting the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> of the Received Text).
