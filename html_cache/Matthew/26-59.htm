The Sanhedrin consisted of 71 members, including the high priest, elders, and scribes, and was responsible for religious and legal matters. This assembly was located in Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life, and played a crucial role in maintaining Jewish law and order under Roman occupation. The involvement of the entire Sanhedrin highlights the gravity of the situation and the unified opposition against Jesus.<p><b>were seeking false testimony against Jesus</b><br>The act of seeking false testimony indicates a premeditated effort to convict Jesus, despite the lack of legitimate evidence. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, which speak of the Messiah being falsely accused and oppressed. The religious leaders' willingness to subvert justice underscores their fear of Jesus' growing influence and their desire to maintain their authority. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of truth versus falsehood, as seen in the trials of other biblical figures like Daniel.<p><b>in order to put Him to death</b><br>The ultimate goal of the chief priests and the Sanhedrin was to execute Jesus, viewing Him as a threat to their power and the status quo. This desire for His death fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would be "cut off from the land of the living" for the transgressions of the people. The death of Jesus is central to Christian theology, as it represents the atoning sacrifice for sin, prefigured by the sacrificial system in the Old Testament. The leaders' actions also highlight the tension between human authority and divine purpose, as God's redemptive plan unfolds through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who held significant power and influence.

The law of Moses required at least two witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), and these, it is natural to believe, were examined independently of each other.

The Sanhedrists had decided on Christ's death; it only remained to find such a charge against him as would compel the Roman authorities to deal summarily with him.

They knew well that Christ could be condemned on no true testimony, hence they scrupled not to seek false. If they had meant to deal fairly, they would have allowed some who knew him to speak in his favour; but this was the very last thing which they desired or would have sanctioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-59.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
