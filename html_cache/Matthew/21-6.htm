This act of following Jesus' instructions is a demonstration of their faith and commitment. In the broader biblical context, this obedience is reminiscent of the call of Abraham, who also acted in faith without knowing the full picture (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>). The disciples' actions here set a precedent for Christian discipleship, emphasizing the importance of following Christ's commands.<p><b>and did as Jesus had directed them.</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' specific instructions regarding the procurement of a donkey and a colt for His entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-2.htm">Matthew 21:2-3</a>). This act is significant as it fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of the King coming to Jerusalem "gentle and riding on a donkey." The disciples' compliance with Jesus' directions underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. It also illustrates the role of the disciples as active participants in the fulfillment of prophecy, serving as instruments in God's plan. This obedience is a model for believers, showing the importance of aligning one's actions with the will of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is orchestrating the events leading to His triumphal entry into Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are obediently carrying out His instructions, demonstrating their trust and submission to His authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_triumphal_entry.htm">The Triumphal Entry</a></b><br>The event where Jesus enters Jerusalem riding on a donkey, fulfilling Old Testament prophecy and symbolizing His role as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_commands.htm">Obedience to Christ's Commands</a></b><br>The disciples' actions demonstrate the importance of obeying Jesus' instructions, even when the reasons are not immediately clear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>The disciples' willingness to follow Jesus' directions without question shows their trust in His plan and purpose, encouraging us to do the same in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on a donkey fulfills prophecy, reminding us of the reliability and truth of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_discipleship.htm">Role of Discipleship</a></b><br>Being a disciple involves active participation in God's work, as seen in the disciples' role in preparing for Jesus' entry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_donkey.htm">Symbolism of the Donkey</a></b><br>The choice of a donkey, a symbol of peace, contrasts with a war horse, emphasizing Jesus' mission of peace and humility.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_21_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 21:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_6_Obedience_to_Jesus.htm">How does Matthew 21:6 demonstrate obedience to Jesus' instructions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faithfulness_in_Matthew_21_6.htm">What can we learn about faithfulness from the disciples' actions in Matthew 21:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_6_and_OT_Messiah_prophecies.htm">How does Matthew 21:6 connect to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_emulate_disciples_obedience.htm">In what ways can we apply the disciples' obedience in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_obeying_Jesus_in_Matthew_21_6_help.htm">How does following Jesus' commands in Matthew 21:6 strengthen our relationship with Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_6_Prophecy_fulfilled_how.htm">How does Matthew 21:6 demonstrate the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_disciples_obey_Jesus_in_Matt_21_6.htm">Why did the disciples obey Jesus' instructions in Matthew 21:6 without question?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_6_Jesus_authority_significance.htm">What significance does Matthew 21:6 hold in understanding Jesus' authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_wide_gate_to_destruction.htm">Am I the one, Lord?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_matthew_mention_two_animals.htm">How does Matthew 21:4-7 reconcile Jesus riding both a donkey and a colt, unlike the single animal mentioned in other Gospels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/disciples'_reaction_to_jesus_walking_on_water.htm">How did the disciples react when Jesus walked on water?

The word signals an immediate, unbroken response&#8212;no delay, no debate (cf. <a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>, &#8220;So Abram departed, as the LORD had instructed him&#8221;; <a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents obedience as the proper pivot between God&#8217;s command and human action (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Here, the hinge swings smoothly&#8212;exactly the pattern the Lord still seeks from us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the disciples went</b><p>&#8226; Obedience begins with movement. They left the Mount of Olives and stepped toward the village, demonstrating faith in Christ&#8217;s authority (<a href="/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Going often precedes understanding. They had no donkey yet, but they trusted the outcome to Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>; <a href="/luke/9-60.htm">Luke 9:60</a>).<p>&#8226; Our own discipleship mirrors this rhythm: hear, rise, go. When Christ says &#8220;Go,&#8221; lingering is disobedience by another name (<a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights completion, not mere intention. They finished what they started (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Partial obedience is disobedience; the disciples carried out every detail, from untying the colt to bringing it to Jesus (<a href="/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience produces results that align with prophecy&#8212;here, fulfilling <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> (<a href="/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as Jesus had directed them</b><p>&#8226; The benchmark for obedience is not preference or tradition but the specific word of Christ (<a href="/john/15-14.htm">John 15:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; directions carry divine authority (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>). By following them exactly, the disciples affirmed His messianic kingship.<p>&#8226; Their example invites us to measure our actions by His commands recorded in Scripture, confident that His word is both trustworthy and sufficient (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/21-6.htm">Matthew 21:6</a> shows obedience in motion: the disciples immediately move, completely act, and precisely follow Jesus&#8217; instructions.
