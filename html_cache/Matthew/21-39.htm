The seizing of the son represents the rejection and mistreatment of God's messengers, culminating in the rejection of Jesus Christ. Historically, this mirrors the treatment of prophets in Israel, such as Jeremiah and Zechariah, who faced persecution for delivering God's messages. The act of seizing indicates a premeditated and forceful rejection, symbolizing the religious leaders' opposition to Jesus.<p><b>and threw him out of the vineyard</b><br>The vineyard is a metaphor for Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is depicted as a vineyard planted by God. Throwing the son out of the vineyard signifies the rejection of Jesus by the Jewish leaders and His crucifixion outside the city of Jerusalem, as noted in <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>. This act of casting out also fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was despised and rejected by men.<p><b>and killed him</b><br>This phrase foreshadows the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the ultimate act of rejection by the Jewish leaders. The killing of the son in the parable parallels the historical event of Jesus' death, which was orchestrated by the religious authorities and carried out by the Romans. This act fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speak of the Messiah's suffering and death. Theologically, this represents the culmination of humanity's sin and rebellion against God, yet it also sets the stage for redemption through Christ's resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>These are the individuals in the parable who are responsible for caring for the vineyard.

This is prophecy, and alludes to a particular circumstance attending the death of Christ, viz. that he suffered without the city Jerusalem, Calvary being outside the walls (see <a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>, and the parallel passages in the other evangelists, and especially <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11, 12</a>, where it is significantly noted that Jesus "suffered without the gate"). The words may also contain a reference to the fact that he was excommunicated and given over to the heathen to be judged and condemned, thus suffering not actually at the hands of "the husbandmen" (comp. <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>).
