The act of cursing and swearing was a way to strongly deny any association with Jesus. In Jewish culture, invoking curses or oaths was a serious matter, often calling upon God as a witness to one's truthfulness. This moment highlights Peter's human frailty and the pressure he felt in a hostile environment. It also fulfills Jesus' earlier prediction that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crowed (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I do not know the man!&#8221;</b><br>Peter's denial is direct and emphatic. By referring to Jesus as "the man," Peter distances himself from any personal connection or discipleship. This denial is significant because Peter was one of Jesus' closest disciples, having witnessed His miracles and teachings firsthand. The denial contrasts sharply with Peter's earlier declaration of unwavering loyalty (<a href="/matthew/26-33.htm">Matthew 26:33</a>). This moment serves as a reminder of human weakness and the need for divine grace.<p><b>And immediately a rooster crowed.</b><br>The crowing of the rooster is a pivotal moment, marking the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy about Peter's denial. Roosters were common in the region, and their crowing signaled the approach of dawn. This sound would have been familiar to Peter, serving as a stark reminder of his failure. The immediacy of the rooster's crow emphasizes the accuracy of Jesus' prediction and the inevitability of God's sovereign plan. This event also foreshadows Peter's eventual repentance and restoration, as seen in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-19</a>, where Jesus reinstates Peter after His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and impulsive nature.

Peter has twice denied knowing Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-70.htm">Matthew 26:70&#8211;72</a>), and the pressure mounts as bystanders keep identifying him. The phrase signals the tipping point&#8212;the instant when lingering fear outweighs former boldness (<a href="/matthew/14-29.htm">Matthew 14:29</a>). Luke records that this is about an hour after the second denial (<a href="/luke/22-59.htm">Luke 22:59</a>), showing how temptation can linger and wear us down if we remain in the wrong place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He began to curse</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Curse&#8221; here means calling down judgment on himself if he is lying&#8212;an alarming step for a disciple (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s speech now mirrors the crowd&#8217;s coarse language, illustrating <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>: &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It is the tragic climax of the slide that started with overconfidence (<a href="/matthew/26-33.htm">Matthew 26:33</a>) and continued with prayerlessness in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40&#8211;41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And to swear to them</b><p>&#8226; He backs the curse with an oath&#8212;exactly what Jesus had warned against: &#8220;Do not swear at all&#8230; Let your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and your &#8216;No,&#8217; &#8216;No&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34, 37</a>).<p>&#8226; Oaths were meant to confirm truth (<a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>), but here an oath masks a lie, violating the third commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s escalating words show how sin accelerates when unchecked (<a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I do not know the man!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The denial is total&#8212;Peter will not even say Jesus&#8217; name.

Peter&#8217;s coming repentance (<a href="/luke/22-62.htm">Luke 22:62</a>) and subsequent commission (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15&#8211;17</a>) prove that promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Immediately a rooster crowed</b><p>&#8226; The sound fulfills Jesus&#8217; precise prediction: &#8220;Before the rooster crows, you will disown Me three times&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>; <a href="/mark/14-30.htm">Mark 14:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Luke notes that Jesus &#8220;turned and looked at Peter&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-61.htm">Luke 22:61</a>).
