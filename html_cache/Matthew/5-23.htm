The altar was central to Jewish worship, where offerings were made to atone for sins and express devotion to God. This practice is rooted in the Old Testament, where the altar is a place of sacrifice and communion with God (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The act of offering a gift signifies an intention to worship and seek reconciliation with God. The Temple, as the location of the altar, was the heart of Jewish religious life, emphasizing the importance of purity and sincerity in worship.<p><b>and there remember that your brother has something against you,</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of interpersonal relationships in the context of worship. The term "brother" can be understood broadly to mean any fellow believer or member of the community. The instruction to reconcile with a brother before offering a gift underscores the biblical principle that right relationships with others are integral to a right relationship with God (1 <a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20-21</a>). This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of reconciliation and forgiveness, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a> and <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>.

The worshipper is about to offer a "gift" (the most generic term seems intentionally used to represent any kind of offering), and stands at the altar with the priest waiting to do his work. That is the right time for recollection and self-scrutiny. The worshipper is to ask himself, not whether he has a ground of complaint against any one, but whether any one has cause of complaint against him. This, and not the other, is the right question at such a moment--has he injured his neighbour by act, or spoken bitter words of him?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. Seeing that the consequences of an angry spirit are so terrible. For there is no thought here of an unforgiving spirit spoiling the acceptance of the gift (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Our Lord is insisting that it is so important to lose no time in seeking reconciliation with a person whom one has injured, that even the very holiest action must be put off for it. <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou bring</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">if... thou art offering</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> (similarly, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>, ver. 24), the technical word coming some sixty times in Leviticus alone.

Since those to whom he spoke were still Jews, Christ illustrates his meaning by Jewish practices. A perverse literalism has found here a direct reference to the Eucharist. For reasonable <span class="accented">adaptations</span> (cf. even in ' Didache,' &sect; 14.) of these two verses to this, see Waterland, 'Doctrine of the Eucharist,' ch. 13. &sect; 4 (pp. 359-362, Oxford, 1868). <span class="cmt_word">And there rememberest</span>, etc. For the spirit of recollection may well culminate with the culminating action. Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.') shows that even the Jews taught such a postponement of the sacrifice if theft was remembered. He therefore thinks that the stress is on "ought" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>): "For that which the <span class="accented">Jews</span> restrained only to pecuniary damages, Christ extends to all offences against our brother." But he overlooks the fact that, while the Jewish precept had reference to a sin (or even the neglect of some ceremonial rule, cf. Mishna, 'Pes.,' 3:7) vitiating the offering, there is no thought of this hero (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy brother</span> (ver. 22, note). <span class="cmt_word">Ought</span>.
