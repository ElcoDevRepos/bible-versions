It emphasizes the immediacy and significance of the events that transpire as a result of His crucifixion. The timing underscores the divine orchestration of these events, marking a pivotal moment in salvation history.<p><b>the veil of the temple was torn in two</b><br>The veil in the temple separated the Holy of Holies, where God's presence was believed to dwell, from the rest of the temple. Its tearing symbolizes the removal of the barrier between God and humanity, granting believers direct access to God through Jesus Christ. This act fulfills the prophecy of a new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>) and signifies the end of the old sacrificial system. The tearing from top to bottom suggests divine intervention, as it would be impossible for humans to tear it in such a manner.<p><b>from top to bottom</b><br>This detail highlights that the tearing was an act of God, not man. The veil was approximately 60 feet high and several inches thick, making it humanly impossible to tear from top to bottom. This divine act signifies that the way to God is now open through Jesus' sacrifice, aligning with <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>, which speaks of Jesus' body as the new and living way into the Holy of Holies.<p><b>The earth quaked</b><br>Earthquakes in biblical times were often seen as manifestations of God's power and presence (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>). This earthquake serves as a divine confirmation of the significance of Jesus' death, echoing the Old Testament theophanies where God's presence was accompanied by natural phenomena. It also foreshadows the eschatological shaking of the heavens and the earth (<a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>).<p><b>and the rocks were split</b><br>The splitting of rocks further emphasizes the supernatural nature of the events surrounding Jesus' death. It symbolizes the breaking of the old order and the establishment of a new covenant.

The verse proclaims that through Christ crucified, the way to God is now wide open, the old order is passing, and all creation bears witness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">The veil of the temple was rent in twain.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the veil of the sanctuary,</span> or, if we do not alter the word, we must remember that it is the veil that divided the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies that is here meant. The fact, which the high priests would naturally have wished to conceal, and which in the nature of the case could not have been seen by any but the sons of Aaron, may have been reported by the "great multitude of the priests" who "became obedient to the faith" (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm" title="And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.">Acts 6:7</a>). The Evangelist's record of it is all the more significant, as he does not notice, and apparently, therefore, did not apprehend, the symbolic import of the fact. That import we learn indirectly from the Epistle to the Hebrews. The priests had, as far as they had power, destroyed the true Temple (comp. <a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>); but in doing so they had robbed their own sanctuary of all that made it holy. The true veil, as that which shrouded the Divine Glory from the eyes of men, was His own flesh, and through that He had passed, as the Forerunner of all who trusted in Him, into the sanctuary not made with hands, eternal in the heavens (<a href="/context/hebrews/10-20.htm" title="By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;">Hebrews 10:20-21</a>). All who fulfilled that condition might enter into that holiest place, but the visible sanctuary was now made common and unclean, and there too all might enter without profanation.<p><span class= "bld">The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</span>--Jerusalem was, it will be remembered, situated in the zone of earthquakes, and one very memorable convulsion is recorded or alluded to in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/24-19.htm" title="The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.">Isaiah 24:19</a>; <a href="/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm" title="And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.">Zechariah 14:5</a>). Here, though the shock startled men at the time, there was no widespread ruin such as would lead to its being chronicled by contemporary historians. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51-56.</span> - <span class="accented">Signs following the death of Christ.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-38.htm">Mark 15:38-41</a>; <a href="/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47-49</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold.</span> St. Matthew thus introduces his account of the portents which attended the death of the Son of God. The rending of the veil is mentioned by the synoptists as consequent on, and occurring simultaneously with, the completion of the ineffable sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">The veil of the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). There were two principal veils in the present temple - one between the vestibule and the holy place, and one other which is that here referred to, a constituent part of the edifce. This was the veil between the holy place and the holy of holies, which was moved aside only once a year to admit the high priest to the shrine on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>). It was large and costly, some sixty feet high, and made of rich materials. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 4) tells us of one of the veils in the temple, that it was a Babylonian curtain, embroidered with linen in various colours, woven together with wonderful art, such as the eye loved to rest upon. <span class="cmt_word">Was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</span> An apocryphal Gospel ('The Gospel of the Hebrews'), quoted by St. Jerome, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, asserts that the exquisitely carved lintel to which the veil was fastened was at this moment shattered to pieces, and in its fall tore the curtain asunder. The direction of the rent would show that no human hands had torn it apart, and the rending seems to have preceded the earthquake. The violent act was supernatural, and of a typical nature, as we are taught by <a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6-12</a>. The sanctuary enshrined the presence of God, from which the veil excluded every one but the high priest on one special occasion, thus denoting the imperfect reconciliation between God and his people, and that the way to the holiest was not yet made manifest. The rending of this veil betokened the opening of the access to heaven through the wounded body of Christ: as we read in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 20</a>, "Having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh." "When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers." The distinction between Jew and Gentile was abolished, the mysteries of the old Law were opened and manifested, all rites and ceremonies were made of sacramental efficacy, and ministered grace. How soon this ominous occurrence was discovered, we know not. The priest who offered incense at the evening sacrifice about this same hour must have seen it, and spread abroad among his comrades the news, to which many would attach a meaning fatal to the security of their religion. But this was comparatively a private sign; the next one was of a more comprehensive and public character. <span class="cmt_word">The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</span> The last verb is the same as was used just before in the case of the veil. There was a local earthquake at this awful moment, as if the very land shuddered at the terrible crime that had been committed. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem is supposed to cover the Golgotha of the Crucifixion (see on ver. 33). "An opening, faced with silver, shows the spot where the cross is said to have been sunk in the rock, and less than five feet from it is a long brass open work slide, over a cleft in the rock, which is about six inches deep, but is supposed by the pilgrims to reach to the centre of the earth. This is said to mark the rending of the rocks at the Crucifixion" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' p. 447). The fact of the earthquake is testified by Phlegon, whose words were quoted by Julius Africanus, in his 'Chronographia' (fragments of which work have been published by Routh and others), and by Eusebius, in his 'Chronicon' (the passage, no longer extant in the original, being preserved by Jerome, and in an Armenian version; see Morison, on ver. 45). The rending of the rocks is attested by St. Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem ('Cateches.,' 13:33), who speaks of the remarkable fissure in Golgotha, which he had often noticed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At that moment</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
