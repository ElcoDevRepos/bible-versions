The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Tiberias, was a hub for fishing and trade, making it a strategic location for reaching various towns. Boats were a common mode of transportation for Jesus and His disciples, symbolizing His readiness to move and minister wherever needed. This also reflects His mastery over nature, as seen in previous passages where He calms storms.<p><b>crossed over</b><br>The act of crossing over signifies a transition from one area of ministry to another. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it often represents moving from a place of rejection to one of acceptance or vice versa. This movement can also symbolize the crossing from the old covenant to the new, as Jesus brings His message of salvation to different regions. The crossing over can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual transition and transformation.<p><b>and came to His own town</b><br>"His own town" refers to Capernaum, which served as Jesus' base of operations during His Galilean ministry. Capernaum was a significant town located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was a bustling center of commerce and trade, providing a strategic location for Jesus to reach a diverse audience. Archaeological findings, such as the remains of a synagogue and Peter's house, support the biblical accounts of Jesus' activities in Capernaum.
