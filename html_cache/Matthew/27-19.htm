This setting underscores the legal and political authority Pilate held as the Roman governor of Judea. The act of sitting on the judgment seat signifies a formal judicial proceeding, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Pilate's role here fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being judged by Gentiles (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>).<p><b>his wife sent him this message</b><br>Pilate's wife is not named in the Bible, but her intervention is significant. In Roman culture, women typically did not have a public voice, especially in legal matters. Her sending a message indicates the urgency and seriousness of her concern. This moment is unique in the Gospels, showing divine intervention through a dream, which was a common way God communicated in biblical times (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>).<p><b>Have nothing to do with that innocent man</b><br>The declaration of Jesus as "innocent" by Pilate's wife adds to the narrative of Jesus' sinlessness and unjust suffering. This aligns with the theme of Jesus as the spotless Lamb of God (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). Her statement contrasts with the accusations from the Jewish leaders, emphasizing the injustice of the trial.<p><b>for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him</b><br>Dreams were often seen as divine messages in ancient cultures, including Roman and Jewish traditions. The suffering she experienced indicates the intensity and divine origin of the dream. This dream serves as a warning to Pilate, paralleling other biblical instances where God used dreams to guide or warn individuals (<a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>, <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>).

Pilate, though pagan, occupies authority given &#8220;from above&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>), echoing the Old Testament mandate that judges render righteous judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226;

The latter fact is probable enough. About this time, both at Rome and in other cities, such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as Thessalonica and Ber?a (<a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-12.htm" title="Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.">Acts 17:12</a>), Jews had gained considerable influence over women of the higher classes, and carried on an active work of proselytism.<p><span class= "bld">With that just man.</span>--The word is striking, as showing the impression which had been made on Pilate's wife by all she had seen or heard. As contrasted with priests and scribes, He was emphatically the "just," the "righteous "One.<p><span class= "bld">In a dream because of him.</span>--Questions rise in our minds as to the nature of the dream. Was it, as some have thought, a divine warning intended to save her husband from the guilt into which he was on the point of plunging? Did it come from the Evil Spirit, as designed to hinder the completion of the atoning work? Was it simply the reflection of the day-thoughts of a sensitive and devout woman? We have no <span class= "ital">data</span> for answering such questions, but the very absence of <span class= "ital">data</span> makes it safer and more reverential to adopt the last view, as involving less of presumptuous conjecture in a region where we have not been called to enter. What the dream was like may be a subject for a poet's or--as in a well-known picture by a living artist--for a painter's imagination, but does not fall within the province of the interpreter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he was set down</span> (<span class="accented">was sitting</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>on the judgment seat.</span> This was a curule chair placed on a raised stone platform in front of the Praetorium, where the Roman governors sat to give judgment in cases brought before them (see <a href="/john/19-13.htm">John 19:13</a>). It was while he was waiting to hear the decision of the multitude with respect to the selection of the prisoners that the episode that follows (mentioned alone by St. Matthew) occurs. <span class="cmt_word">His wife.</span> Her name, according to ecclesiastical tradition, was Claudia, the addition of Procula being probably a mistake. In the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus (ch. 2) she is said to have been a convert to Judaism. Other accounts affirm that she ultimately became a Christian; and the Greek Church has canonized her, and inserted her in the Menology on October 27. It is probable that she was well acquainted with, and favourably disposed towards, the claims of Christ; and if she had impressed her husband in some degree with her own views, this fact may have influenced him to make some effort to save Jesus. Doubtless she had thought much upon the subject, and talked it over with Pilate; hence her dream was the natural sequence of that with which her mind had been filled in her waking moments, though providentially ordered. It speaks for the accuracy of the evangelist's account, that lately the governors had been allowed to take their wives with them into their official districts, a law previously having forbidden this indulgence (see Tacitus, 'Annul.,' 3:33, 34). <span class="cmt_word">Have thou nothing to do with that just Man.</span> Wordsworth well remarks, "In the whole history of the Passion of Christ no one pleads for him but a woman, the wife of a heathen governor, the deputy of the emperor of the world." This was another wanting given to Pilate to arrest him in his criminal cowardice. The expression used means literally, "Let there be nothing to thee and that Righteous One," which is equivalent to "Do nothing to him for which you will be hereafter sorry." <span class="cmt_word">I have suffered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">I suffered</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>many things this day in a dream because of him.</span> It is useless to inquire the nature of her dream. From the way in which it is here introduced, and from what we know of God's employment of dreams in other cases to communicate his will to men, we may reasonably conclude that this was divinely sent to convey a lesson to Pilate through his wife, who alone, perhaps, was able to arouse the better feelings of his heart. The mention of her suffering shows that she had some dreadful experiences to relate in connection with the fate of the righteous Jesus. As at the beginning of Christ's life, so at its close, such communications were addressed to strangers. Pilate's superstitious fears would be excited by this mysterious dream, but they were not able to overpower counteracting influences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[While]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Pilate] was sitting</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(Kath&#275;menou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2521.htm">Strong's 2521: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit, be seated, enthroned; I dwell, reside.
