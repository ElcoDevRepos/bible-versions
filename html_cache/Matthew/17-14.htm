Jesus, along with Peter, James, and John, had just descended from the Mount of Transfiguration, where they witnessed His divine glory. The "crowd" often represents the general populace, eager to see Jesus perform miracles or hear His teachings. Crowds were common in Jesus' ministry, reflecting His growing popularity and the people's desperation for healing and hope.<p><b>a man came up to Jesus</b><br>The man approaching Jesus signifies an act of faith and desperation. In the Gospels, individuals often sought Jesus out for healing, demonstrating belief in His power. This man's approach is a direct and personal appeal, highlighting the accessibility of Jesus to those in need. It reflects the cultural context where individuals would seek out rabbis or healers for help.<p><b>and knelt before Him</b><br>Kneeling is a posture of humility, respect, and worship. In the Jewish culture of the time, kneeling before someone was a sign of reverence and submission. This act indicates the man's recognition of Jesus' authority and possibly His divine nature.

The sudden shift from heavenly glory to human need highlights how the Lord moves seamlessly between divine revelation and daily ministry.<p>&#8226; A crowd is already gathered, anticipating Jesus&#8217; return. Mark&#8217;s account stresses the scene: &#8220;When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes were arguing with them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-14.htm">Mark 9:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Crowds repeatedly form whenever Jesus appears (<a href="/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>; 14:14). Their presence underscores humanity&#8217;s constant need for the Savior&#8217;s touch and truth.<p>&#8226; This crowd also reminds us that faith is lived out publicly. Like the early Church that &#8220;continued meeting together in the temple courts&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>), believers today should neither hide their need nor their Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a man came up to Jesus</b><p>&#8226; One desperate father pushes through the multitude.

The magic power of the art of Raffaelle has brought into vivid juxtaposition the contrast between the scene of glory above and that of trouble and unrest below, but we must not allow the impression made by the picture to distort our thoughts of the history. The two scenes did not synchronise. The vision was at night, and the descent from the mountain would have carried those who made the journey some way at least into the day that followed.<p><span class= "bld">There came to him a certain man.</span>--St. Mark (<a href="/context/mark/9-14.htm" title="And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.">Mark 9:14-16</a>) narrates more fully that as our Lord and the three were coming to the disciples, they saw a crowd, and scribes disputing with them; that when the multitude saw this they were astonished, and running to Him, saluted Him; that He then asked, "Why dispute ye with them?" and that this drew forth the answer and the prayer which in St. Matthew's record stands without any prelude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-21.</span> - <span class="accented">Healing of the demoniac</span> boy.

The account of the miracle is much curtailed in our Gospel; the fullest narrative is given by St. Mark, to whom we must refer for the complete details. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they were come to the multitude.</span> St. Luke says this arrival was on "the next day" after the Transfiguration. If this event took place at night, the following morning will be meant. The contrast between the scene on the mountain and that presented by the demoniac below has been seized by Raphael, in his picture of the Transfiguration, at Rome - the last great work that he painted. The upper part of this picture represents Jesus radiant in glory with the heavenly visitants, while the lower panel shows the agonized father, surrounded by the unbelieving crowd, bringing his tortured son to the apostles, who stand helpless and discredited. The painter has, indeed, sacrificed fact to dramatic effect (as the two events were not synchronous); but the lesson enforced thereby is most impressive, and lays holds of the imagination, showing different phases of the life of Christ, and the realms of light and darkness. <span class="cmt_word">There came to him a</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">man</span>. Things had not gone well while Jesus and the three chief apostles were away on the mount. As during the absence of Moses at Sinai the people had fallen into idolatry (<a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>.), so now, when their Master and their leaders were withdrawn, the nine apostles bad faltered in faith and failed in exercising the miraculous powers bestowed upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Kneeling down to him</span>.
