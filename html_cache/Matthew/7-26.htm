In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is addressing a large audience, including His disciples and the crowds gathered around Him. The phrase "these words of Mine" refers to the teachings and commandments Jesus has just delivered, which include the Beatitudes, instructions on prayer, and guidance on righteous living. The emphasis on hearing suggests that the message is accessible to all, but it requires attentive listening and understanding.<p><b>and does not act on them</b><br>This highlights the necessity of not only hearing but also implementing Jesus' teachings in one's life. The biblical principle of faith accompanied by action is echoed in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word and not hearers only. The cultural context of the time valued wisdom and understanding, but Jesus is pointing out that true wisdom is demonstrated through action. This reflects the Jewish tradition of Shema, which means to hear and obey.<p><b>is like a foolish man</b><br>The term "foolish" in biblical literature often denotes a lack of spiritual insight or moral discernment. In the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, a fool is someone who rejects wisdom and instruction. Jesus uses this term to contrast with the wise man who builds on a solid foundation. The foolish man represents those who disregard the teachings of Jesus, choosing instead to follow their own understanding.<p><b>who built his house on sand</b><br>Building on sand symbolizes a lack of foundation and stability. In the geographical context of ancient Palestine, the imagery of building on sand would resonate with the audience, as they were familiar with the seasonal rains that could cause sudden floods. A house built on sand would be vulnerable to collapse when storms came. This metaphor illustrates the spiritual peril of ignoring Jesus' teachings, as it leads to a life without a solid foundation. The imagery also connects to the prophetic warnings in the Old Testament, where God often used the metaphor of building to describe the establishment of a life or nation on a firm foundation of obedience to His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which includes teachings on how to live a life pleasing to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foolish_man.htm">Foolish Man</a></b><br>Represents those who hear Jesus' teachings but fail to implement them in their lives.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Symbolizes one's life or spiritual foundation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sand.htm">Sand</a></b><br>Represents an unstable and unreliable foundation, illustrating the consequences of ignoring Jesus' teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sermon_on_the_mount.htm">Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is given, encompassing Matthew chapters 5-7, where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Hearing Jesus' words is not enough; we must act on them to build a strong spiritual foundation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_inaction.htm">The Consequences of Inaction</a></b><br>Ignoring Jesus' teachings leads to instability and eventual collapse, much like a house built on sand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/building_on_a_solid_foundation.htm">Building on a Solid Foundation</a></b><br>Our lives should be grounded in the teachings of Christ, ensuring that we withstand life's challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Regularly assess whether your actions align with Jesus' teachings, making necessary adjustments to avoid being like the foolish man.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_faith.htm">Practical Faith</a></b><br>True faith is demonstrated through actions that reflect Jesus' teachings, not just intellectual assent.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_7_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 7:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_not_be_like_the_foolish_man.htm">How can we avoid being like the "foolish man" in Matthew 7:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_building_on_sand_symbolize.htm">What does building on "sand" symbolize in our daily Christian walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_7_26_James_1_22_on_action.htm">How does Matthew 7:26 connect with James 1:22 about being doers of the word?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_build_on_rock_not_sand.htm">What practical steps ensure our foundation is on "rock" and not "sand"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Is_our_spiritual_base_biblically_sound.htm">How can we discern if our spiritual foundation aligns with biblical teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_7_26_Ignoring_Jesus_teachings.htm">What does Matthew 7:26 reveal about the consequences of ignoring Jesus' teachings?

In the Plain of Sharon the clay seems to have been so interior that not only were the jars made of it often worthless, but the bricks could offer so little resistance to the weather that the houses were hardly safe. Hence a special prayer was offered by the high priest on the Day of Atonement that the Lord would grant that their houses might not become their tombs (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Yoma,' 5:2 [Schwab, p. 218]; cf. Neubauer, 'Geograph.,' p. 48). In the parable, however, it is not the structure, but the foundation, that is wrong. <span class="accented">The sand</span> may refer, as Stanley suggests ('Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 13. p. 430), to one locality, in which case it is probably "the long sandy strip of land which bounds the eastern plain of Acre, and through which the Kishon flows into the sea;" or, as would seem more probable, to the sand which would naturally be found on the edges of such a torrent as is here described. <span class="accented">Beat upon</span>; <span class="accented">smote upon</span> (Revised Version). In ver. 25 the thought is more of the swoop of the tempest (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); here, of its impact on the house (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It is possible that there is here less indication of force necessary for the destruction. "It needed only the first blow, and the house fell" (Weiss, 'Matthaus-ev.'). <span class="accented">And great was the fall of it.</span> Our Lord's solemn verdict of the utter ruin awaiting him who does not put his assent into action. The clause conveys an impression even stronger than ver. 23. There the positive worker of lawlessness is banished from Christ's presence; here, on the mere non-worker of Divine messages received is pronounced ruin and (for such, at least, seems suggested) that irremediable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/7-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
