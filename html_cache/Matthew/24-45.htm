In biblical context, a servant is often a metaphor for a believer or disciple. Faithfulness is a key theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which highlights the faith of the patriarchs. Wisdom, as described in Proverbs, is the application of knowledge and understanding in a godly manner. The question posed by Jesus challenges the listener to self-reflect on their own faithfulness and wisdom in serving God.<p><b>whom the master has put in charge of his household</b><br>The master represents Jesus Christ, who entrusts His followers with responsibilities. The household can be seen as the Church or the community of believers. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where believers are entrusted with the care and management of God's resources and people, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>. The imagery of a household also connects to the cultural context of the time, where servants were often given significant responsibilities in managing their master's affairs.<p><b>to give the others their food</b><br>This phrase highlights the servant's duty to provide for others, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and care. In <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>, Jesus instructs Peter to "feed my sheep," emphasizing the role of leaders in nurturing the faith of others. The provision of food can also be seen as a metaphor for teaching and preaching the Word of God, which is described as spiritual sustenance in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>.<p><b>at the proper time</b><br>Timing is crucial in fulfilling one's duties, reflecting the importance of discernment and readiness. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven, underscoring the need for wisdom in recognizing and acting at the appropriate moment. This phrase also alludes to the eschatological theme of being prepared for Christ's return, as emphasized in the surrounding context of <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, where Jesus speaks about the end times and the need for vigilance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_and_wise_servant.htm">The Faithful and Wise Servant</a></b><br>Represents believers who are entrusted with responsibilities in God's kingdom.

By framing it this way, Jesus invites every listener to pause and examine personal readiness for His return (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>). Like <a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>, the question is not academic; it presses for a heart response. Second Corinthians 13:5 urges, &#8220;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith,&#8221; echoing the same call.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;Who then&#8221; ties the servant&#8217;s identity directly to the preceding warnings about unexpected judgment (<a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-41</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores accountability: no one can assume faithfulness; it must be proven (<a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the faithful and wise servant</b><p>Faithfulness and wisdom go hand in hand.

Everything&#8212;identity, responsibility, action, and timing&#8212;centers on the Master&#8217;s trust and soon appearing. Remaining steadfast in that trust secures the blessing Jesus describes in the verses that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">Who then is a faithful . . .?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Who then is the faithful and wise servant?</span> The latter word in the Greek is that which ethical writers had used to express the moral wisdom which adapts means to ends, as contrasted with the wisdom of pure contemplation on the one hand, or technical skill on the other.<p><span class= "bld">To give them meat in due season.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to give them their food.</span> In the parallel passage of <a href="/luke/12-42.htm" title="And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?">Luke 12:42</a>, the word used means "a measure or fixed portion of meal or flour." The comparison brings before us one function of the minister of Christ. He is to supply men with the spiritual food which they need for the sustenance of their higher life. It may be the "spiritual milk" of <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>; it may be the "strong meat" or "solid food." There is an art, as it were, of spiritual dietetics, which requires tact and discernment as well as faithfulness. The wise servant will seek to discover not only the right kind of food, but the right season for giving it. An apparent parallel presents itself in the common interpretation of "rightly dividing the word of truth" (<a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2Timothy 2:15</a>), but the imagery implied in that phrase is probably of an entirely different character.

In <a href="/luke/12-41.htm">Luke 12:41</a>, etc, Christ utters this parabolic discourse in reply to Peter's question, "Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?" He now turns his exhortation to those in authority over the house, specially to the ministers and stewards of his mysteries, proposing it in an interrogative form, not only because the man he wants is difficult to find, but in order that each may put the question to himself, and see if he reaches the high standard suggested. <span class="cmt_word">Is a</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faithful and wise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">prudens, practically wise</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant</span>.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is used classically for a body of attendants, the servants that form the family, the <span class="accented">menage.</span> Christ asks - Where is one to be found fit for this position in his Church? It is the Lord who selects and appoints the steward; he is neither self-constituted nor appointed by those over whom he rules. <span class="cmt_word">To give</span> <span class="cmt_word">them meat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">their food</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in due season.</span> It was the duty of such an officer to dispense the regular allowance of daily food to the members of the household. So the stewards of the mysteries of Christ have to feed his flock with spiritual food, with the Word and sacraments, and. to do this wisely and discreetly, according to the capacity, advancement, and circumstances of each recipient. The exhortation holds good for others as well as the clergy, civil rulers, the rich, all men. All our endowments, mental, spiritual, physical, material, are the gift of God, and are to be used in his service and to the good of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/24-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
