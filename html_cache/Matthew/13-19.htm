This message includes the call to repentance, the promise of salvation, and the invitation to enter into a new covenant relationship with God. The Kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope, as seen in Jesus' teachings and parables. In the context of <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, Jesus uses parables to reveal truths about the kingdom to those who are willing to listen and understand.<p><b>but does not understand it</b><br>Understanding here implies more than intellectual comprehension; it involves spiritual insight and acceptance. The lack of understanding can be attributed to a hardened heart or spiritual blindness, which prevents the message from taking root. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who hear but do not understand, a passage Jesus references in <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a> to explain why He speaks in parables.<p><b>the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart</b><br>The "evil one" is a reference to Satan, who actively works to prevent the Word of God from taking root in people's hearts. This imagery of snatching away seeds reflects the spiritual battle that occurs when the gospel is preached. In <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, Satan is described as a prowling lion seeking to devour, highlighting his role in opposing God's work. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions, and is the place where the Word must take root for true transformation.<p><b>This is the seed sown along the path</b><br>The "seed sown along the path" represents those who hear the Word but are unresponsive due to a hardened heart. The path is a metaphor for a heart that is trampled and compacted, unable to receive the seed. In the agricultural context of first-century Palestine, paths were common in fields, and seeds falling on them would be quickly eaten by birds or trampled underfoot. This illustrates the vulnerability of the Word when it is not protected by understanding and faith. The parable of the sower, in which this verse is found, serves as a warning and an encouragement to cultivate a receptive heart for the Word of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about the kingdom of heaven through parables to convey spiritual truths.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_evil_one.htm">The Evil One</a></b><br>Refers to Satan, who actively works to prevent the Word of God from taking root in people's hearts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Represents anyone who shares the message of the kingdom, primarily Jesus and His disciples.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path.htm">The Path</a></b><br>Symbolizes the hearts of those who hear the Word but do not understand it, making them vulnerable to the evil one.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_message_of_the_kingdom.htm">The Message of the Kingdom</a></b><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the good news of salvation and the coming of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_word.htm">Understanding the Word</a></b><br>It is crucial to seek understanding when hearing the Word of God.

parable: people who hear the gospel yet leave it unpondered and unaccepted. Because truth remains on the surface, Satan swiftly removes it, preventing faith from sprouting. The verse urges us to cultivate receptive hearts&#8212;letting the word sink in, seeking understanding, and standing alert against the enemy&#8212;so the seed of the kingdom can take root and bear lasting fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">When any one heareth the word.</span>--The explanation has become so familiar to us that it is hard to place ourselves in the position of those to whom it was the unveiling of new truths--the holding up a mirror in which they might see, it might be, their own likeness. Our interest in it may, perhaps, be quickened if we think of it as reflecting what had actually been our Lord's experience. The classes of hearers who had gathered round Him were represented, roughly and generally, by the four issues of the seed scattered by the sower, and all preachers of the truth, from that day to this, have felt that their own experience has presented analogous phenomena.<p>The ethical sequence described runs thus: The man hears "the word of the kingdom," a discourse, say, like the Sermon on the Mount, or that at Nazareth (<a href="/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16-21</a>). He does not "understand" it (the fault being moral rather than intellectual), does not attend to it or "take it in." The "wicked one" (note the connection with the clause in the Lord's Prayer, "Deliver us from evil," or <span class= "ital">the evil one</span>) snatches it away even from his memory. At first it seems strange that "the birds of the air" in their multitude should represent the Tempter in his unity; and yet there is a terrible truth in the fact that everything which leads men to forget the truth is, in very deed, doing the work of the great enemy. On the other hand, the birds, in their rapid flight and their gathering flocks, may well represent the light and foolish thoughts that are as the Tempter's instruments. The "way-side" thus answers to the character, which is hardened by the wear and tear of daily life, what we well call its routine, so that the words of Truth make hardly even the most transient impression on it.<p><span class= "bld">This is he which received seed.</span>--Our translators try, unsuccessfully, to combine the parable with its interpretation. Literally, and far better, here and in the following verses, <span class= "ital">this man it is that is</span> (the seed) <span class= "ital">sown by the way side.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not.</span> <span class="accented">Understandeth.</span> The form of the explanation here is influenced by the language of vers. 14, 15. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (not in the Greek) <span class="cmt_word">cometh the wicked one;</span> <span class="accented">the evil one</span> (Revised Version); <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">And catcheth</span> (<span class="accented">snatcheth</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">away</span> - seizeth for himself (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a>, note) - <span class="cmt_word">that which was sown in his heart.

And so throughout. The masculine is not merely concise, but also expresses the fact that, as even with land, the man who receives the seed does not put forth in turn merely the seed as something alien, but rather himself so far as he is influenced by the seed; or (regarding the subject from another point of view) he puts forth the new life and energy of the seed as conditioned by that which makes up himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pantos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
