This field was used as a burial place for foreigners. The name "Field of Blood" signifies the blood money used to buy it, highlighting the gravity of Judas's betrayal and the innocent blood of Jesus. This term also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where the thirty pieces of silver are mentioned, and to <a href="/jeremiah/19.htm">Jeremiah 19:1-13</a>, which speaks of a potter's field and the shedding of innocent blood.<p><b>to this day</b><br>The phrase "to this day" indicates that the name "Field of Blood" was still in use at the time the Gospel of Matthew was written, suggesting the lasting impact of the events surrounding Jesus's crucifixion. This phrase also serves to authenticate the historical reliability of the account, as it implies that the field was a known location to the original audience.

It is possible that two spots may have been known by the same name for distinct reasons, and the fact that two places have been shown as the Field of Blood from the time of Jerome downwards, is, as far as it goes, in favour of this view. It is equally possible, on the other hand, that Judas may have gone, before or after the purchase, to the ground which, bought with his money, was, in some sense his own, and there ended his despair, dying literally in Gehenna, and buried, not in the grave of his fathers at Kerioth, but as an outcast, with none to mourn over him, in the cemetery of the aliens.<p><span class= "bld">Unto this day.</span>--The phrase suggests here, as again in <a href="/matthew/28-15.htm" title="So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.">Matthew 28:15</a>, an interval, more or less considerable, between the events and the record.
