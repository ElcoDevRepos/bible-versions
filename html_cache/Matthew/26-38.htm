This setting is significant as it is a place where Jesus often went to pray, located on the Mount of Olives, just outside Jerusalem. The choice of these three disciples highlights their special role among the Twelve, often being present at key moments in Jesus' ministry (e.g., the Transfiguration in <a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>).<p><b>My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death</b><br>This expression of deep anguish reveals the humanity of Jesus, who experiences profound emotional distress.

It also fulfills the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, who is described as "a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief." Jesus' sorrow is not just emotional but spiritual, as He anticipates bearing the sins of the world.<p><b>Stay here and keep watch with Me</b><br>Jesus requests His disciples to remain vigilant and pray with Him, emphasizing the importance of spiritual alertness. This call to watchfulness is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where He instructs His followers to be watchful for His return.

Likewise also said all the disciples.">Matthew 26:35-36</a>, we have probably to place the discourses in John 15 (the reference to the vine, probably suggested by one which was putting forth its leaves in the early spring), John 16, and the great prayer of intercession in John 17. As St. John alone has recorded them, it is probable that he alone entered into their meaning, while others either did not hear them, or listened to them as above their reach, and asked their child-like questions (<a href="/context/john/16-18.htm" title="They said therefore, What is this that he said, A little while? we cannot tell what he said.">John 16:18-19</a>; <a href="/context/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29-30</a>). St. Luke records what we may look on as the germ of the great intercession, in our Lord's words to Peter, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not" (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm" title="But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.">Luke 22:32</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A place called Gethsemane.</span>--The word means "oil-press," and was obviously connected with the culture of the trees from which the Mount took its name. St. John's description implies that it was but a little way beyond the brook Kidron (<a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>), on the lower western slope of the mount. There was, a garden (or rather, <span class= "ital">orchard</span>) there which was the wonted resort of our Lord and the disciples when they sought retirement. The olive-trees now growing in the place shown as Gethsemane, venerable as their age is, can hardly have been those that then grew there, as Josephus expressly records that Titus ordered all the trees in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem to be cut down, and the Tenth Legion was actually encamped on the Mount of Olives (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, v.</span> 2, ? 3). They probably represent the devotion of pilgrims of the fourth or some later century, who replanted the hallowed site. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death</span> (<a href="/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a>). Christ speaks here of the mental agony which he is enduring; he bides not from the faithful three that which weighs upon his heart, so excessive a strain that human nature must fail to endure it. We cannot gauge the anguish; we may suggest some of the causes of this sorrow. It was not merely the thought of bodily pain, though that would be long and excessive; there were other elements which made his sorrow like to no other sorrow. He thought of all the circumstances that led to his Passion; all that would accompany it; all that would succeed it - the malice and perversity of the Jews, the grievous wickedness that brought about his death, the treachery of Judas, the desertion of his friends, the denial of Peter, his unjust condemnation at the hands of the rulers of the chosen nation, the pusillanimity of Pilate, the guilt of the actors in the tragedy, the wilful iniquity of those whom he came to redeem, the ruin which they brought on themselves, their city and nation - such considerations formed one ingredient in the bitter cup which he had to drain. And then the thought of death was unspeakably terrible to the all-holy Son of God. We men become accustomed to the thought of death. It accompanies us through all our life; it looms before us always. But man was created immortal (Wisd. 2:23), his nature shrinks from the dissolution of soul and body; and to the sinless, unfallen Man this experience was wholly unknown and awful. Here was the incarnate God, the God-Man, submitting himself to the punishment of sin, tasting death forevery man, bearing in his own Person the inexpressible bitterness of this penal humiliation. Added to all this was the incalculable fact that "the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all." The burden of the sins of all mankind he bore on his sacred shoulders. "Him who knew no sin God made to be sin on our behalf" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). What this mysterious imputation, so to speak, involved, we cannot tell; but to a being perfectly pure and holy it must have been anguish unspeakable. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry ye here.</span> As ver. 36, "Sit ye here." <span class="cmt_word">And watch with me.</span> In his dark hour his human soul yearned for the comfort of a friendly presence; even though these chosen three might not witness the extremity of his agony, their proximity and sympathy and prayers were a support. But he bade them watch for their own sake also. Their great trial was close at hand; they were about to be tempted to deny and forsake him; they could resist only by prayer and watchfulness (ver. 41). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
