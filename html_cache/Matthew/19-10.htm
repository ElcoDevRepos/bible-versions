This reflects their role as learners and followers, eager to understand the implications of Jesus' radical teachings on marriage and divorce. The context here follows Jesus' teaching on the permanence of marriage, which was counter-cultural to the more lenient views on divorce prevalent in Jewish society at the time.<p><b>&#8220;If this is the case between a man and his wife</b><br>Jesus had just explained that marriage is a lifelong commitment, intended by God from the beginning of creation (referencing <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). This statement by the disciples indicates their surprise at the strictness of Jesus' teaching, which contrasts with the more permissive interpretations of the Mosaic Law regarding divorce (<a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>). The phrase highlights the seriousness of the marital bond and the high standard Jesus sets for His followers.<p><b>it is better not to marry.&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' reaction suggests that they viewed the commitment of marriage as daunting under Jesus' teaching. This reflects a cultural context where marriage was the norm and often seen as a social and economic necessity. Their statement may also echo the sentiments found in <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, where Paul discusses the benefits of singleness for those who can accept it, emphasizing undivided devotion to the Lord. This phrase underscores the radical nature of Jesus' teaching on marriage, challenging societal norms and inviting His followers to consider the spiritual implications of their relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the nature of marriage and the challenges it presents.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present during this teaching.

Recognizing the weight of that commitment, they momentarily wonder if singleness is safer. Jesus will soon clarify that both marriage and celibacy are good gifts, each to be embraced according to God&#8217;s calling. This verse challenges believers to approach marriage with reverence, counting the cost yet trusting God&#8217;s design as perfect and trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">If the case of the man.</span>--The words seem to indicate that the laxer view of the school of Hillel was the more popular one even with those who, like the disciples, had been roused to some efforts after a righteousness higher than that of the scribes or Pharisees. They looked forward to the possible discomforts of marriage under the conditions which their Master had set before them, and drew the conclusion that they outweighed its advantages. Why entangle themselves in a union which they were no longer able to dissolve, when they got tired of it, by the short and easy method of a bill of divorcement? It is instructive to remember that one of the greatest of English writers has taken the same line of thought in dealing with the question. Milton's <span class= "ital">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce,</span> and the treatises that followed it, are but an elaborate and eloquent expression of the words of the disciples, "If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His disciples say unto him.</span> Our Lord appears to have repeated privately to the disciples what he had said publicly to the Pharisees. <span class="cmt_word">If the case</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the man be so with his wife.</span> Some commentators take <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to signify <span class="accented">guilt</span>: "if such guilt appertains to the married state." But the meaning is plain enough anyway, and the word, <span class="cmt_word">as</span> here used, corresponds to the Latin <span class="accented">causa</span>, and the Hebrew <span class="accented">dibrah</span>, which may denote "case," "condition," etc. The disciples reflect the feeling of their day. Marriage without any possibility of essential release (for they see that this is Christ's law) seems to them a severe and unbearable connection. It were better never to marry at all than to fetter one's self with such an inexorable obligation. Such a doctrine was entirely novel in that age, and most unpalatable; and even the apostles receive it with wonder and hesitation. They have not yet leaned that in Messiah's kingdom grace conquers natural inclination, and strengthens the weak will so that it rises superior to custom, prejudice, and the promptings of the flesh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
