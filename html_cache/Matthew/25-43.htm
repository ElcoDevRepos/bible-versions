In ancient Near Eastern culture, welcoming strangers was a moral obligation, often seen as a reflection of one's faithfulness to God. The Israelites were reminded in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> to love the stranger as themselves, as they were once strangers in Egypt. This commandment is echoed in the New Testament, where hospitality is a mark of true discipleship (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>). The failure to welcome the stranger here symbolizes a lack of compassion and recognition of Christ in others, as Jesus identifies Himself with the marginalized.<p><b>I was naked and you did not clothe Me</b><br>Clothing the naked is a basic act of charity and mercy, reflecting God's provision for humanity. In biblical times, clothing was not only a necessity but also a symbol of dignity and respect. The act of clothing the naked is seen in <a href="/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19-20</a>, where Job defends his righteousness by stating he has clothed the poor. This phrase underscores the call to care for the physical needs of others, as doing so is akin to serving Christ Himself. The imagery of clothing is also used in Scripture to describe spiritual truths, such as being clothed in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me.</b><br>Caring for the sick and visiting those in prison were considered acts of mercy and compassion. In the ancient world, prisons were harsh, and prisoners often relied on outsiders for basic needs. The early church was known for its care for the sick and imprisoned, reflecting Jesus' ministry, which included healing the sick and setting captives free (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). This phrase emphasizes the call to minister to those who are suffering and marginalized, recognizing Christ's presence in them. The neglect of these acts is a failure to live out the love and compassion that Jesus exemplified and commanded His followers to practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, presenting a parable about the final judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep_and_the_goats.htm">The Sheep and the Goats</a></b><br>The groups being judged in the parable, representing the righteous and the unrighteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_strangers,_naked,_sick,_and_imprisoned.htm">The Strangers, Naked, Sick, and Imprisoned</a></b><br>Symbolic of those in need whom the righteous are called to serve.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_final_judgment.htm">The Final Judgment</a></b><br>The event where Jesus separates the righteous from the unrighteous based on their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_compassionate_action.htm">The Call to Compassionate Action</a></b><br>Believers are called to actively demonstrate their faith through acts of kindness and service to those in need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_christ_in_others.htm">Recognizing Christ in Others</a></b><br>Serving others, especially the marginalized, is akin to serving Christ Himself.

Abraham entertained angels unawares (<a href="/bsb/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>), and the early church opened homes to traveling believers (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Failure here shows a heart unchanged by grace.

Isaiah tied true fasting to &#8220;sharing your bread with the hungry and providing the poor wanderer with shelter&#8212;when you see the naked, to clothe him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>).<p>&#8226; James presses the point: if someone lacks clothes and we offer only words, &#8220;what good is that?&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a>). Works do not save, but they unmistakably reveal whether saving faith is present.<p>&#8226; Jesus identifies so completely with His disciples that what we do&#8212;or refuse to do&#8212;for them registers in heaven as done to Him (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>; <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me</b><p>&#8226; Visiting the sick and imprisoned requires time, inconvenience, and often courage. Love that pays such costs mirrors the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Early believers lived this out: &#8220;Remember those in prison as if you were bound with them&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-3.htm">Hebrews 13:3</a>). Paul repeatedly received care while jailed (<a href="/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16-18</a>; <a href="/bsb/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 13</a>).<p>&#8226; Neglect here exposes a spiritual disconnect. Pure religion &#8220;to look after orphans and widows in their distress&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>) extends naturally to any suffering member of Christ&#8217;s body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-43.htm">Matthew 25:43</a> confronts professing believers with the evidence their lives present at Christ&#8217;s judgment.

Omission of such mercy betrays unbelief, proving that what is absent in deed was never present in heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#956;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;m&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
