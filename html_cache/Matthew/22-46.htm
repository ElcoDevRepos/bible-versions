In the context of <a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, Jesus had been engaging with the Pharisees and Sadducees, religious leaders who often tried to trap Him with difficult questions. The inability of these learned men to respond underscores Jesus' superior understanding of the Scriptures and His divine insight. This moment reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of wisdom resting upon the Messiah. It also echoes the wisdom of Solomon, who was known for his unparalleled understanding, yet Jesus is portrayed as greater than Solomon (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>).<p><b>and from that day on</b><br>This phrase indicates a turning point in the interactions between Jesus and the religious leaders. Prior to this, the Pharisees and Sadducees frequently challenged Jesus, attempting to discredit Him. However, after this encounter, they ceased their questioning, recognizing that they could not outwit Him. This marks a shift in their strategy, as they begin to plot more directly against Him, leading to the events of His crucifixion. This change in tactics is a fulfillment of the growing opposition prophesied in passages like <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>no one dared to question Him any further</b><br>The use of the word "dared" suggests a recognition of Jesus' authority and the fear of being publicly humiliated or exposed in their lack of understanding. This cessation of questioning can be seen as an acknowledgment of Jesus' divine authority, as even His adversaries could not refute His teachings. It also reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4-9</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is depicted as having a tongue of the learned, able to sustain the weary with a word, and not being put to shame. This moment foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over His opponents, culminating in His resurrection and exaltation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is engaging in a series of debates with the Pharisees and Sadducees, demonstrating His divine wisdom and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

I place my hand over my mouth&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>).<p>- Jesus&#8217; question exposed their incomplete view of Messiah, proving that He is both David&#8217;s descendant and David&#8217;s Lord (<a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from that day on</b><p>- A line was drawn in the sand.

The leaders&#8217; inability to answer, their choice to remain silent, and their retreat from further questioning highlight Jesus&#8217; unquestionable authority as both David&#8217;s Son and David&#8217;s Lord. Their silence foreshadows the cross, where opposition would shift from words to deeds&#8212;yet even that would fulfill God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man was able to answer him a word.</span> They could not confute Christ's arguments; they would not receive and ponder them; so they held their peace.

But this was far from their wish, so they went away empty. <span class="cmt_word">Neither durst any man.</span> They perceived that they could gain no advantage over Christ by such methods of attack. Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, had ignominiously succumbed; to make a fresh assault was to court a fresh defeat, Seeing this, they dared no longer tempt him in this way. Henceforward they would use other tactics. Treachery and violence must now play their part.
