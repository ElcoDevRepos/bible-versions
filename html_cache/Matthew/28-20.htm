The command to teach is rooted in the Jewish tradition of rabbinical instruction, where a rabbi would impart not just knowledge but a way of life to their disciples. Jesus, as the ultimate Rabbi, commands His followers to pass on His teachings, which include the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) and the Great Commandment to love God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The use of "all" underscores the comprehensive nature of Jesus' teachings, which cover moral, ethical, and spiritual dimensions. This directive aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to teach God's commandments diligently to their children, highlighting continuity between the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>And surely I am with you always,</b><br>This promise of Jesus' presence is a profound assurance to His disciples. It echoes God's promise to be with His people throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God assures Joshua of His presence as he leads Israel into the Promised Land. The phrase "I am with you" is significant, as it reflects the divine name "I AM" revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, suggesting Jesus' divinity and eternal presence. This assurance would have been particularly comforting to the early Christians facing persecution, reminding them that they are never alone in their mission. The promise of Jesus' presence is also a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, where the coming Messiah is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us."<p><b>even to the end of the age.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the duration of Jesus' promise, extending until the culmination of history. The "end of the age" refers to the eschatological completion of God's redemptive plan, a concept rooted in Jewish apocalyptic literature. It points to the time when Christ will return, as described in <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, bringing about the new heaven and new earth. This assurance of Jesus' presence until the end of the age provides hope and motivation for believers to continue their mission, knowing that their efforts are part of a divine plan that will ultimately be fulfilled. The phrase also connects to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" is given an everlasting dominion, reinforcing the eternal nature of Christ's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The risen Lord who is giving the Great Commission to His disciples, emphasizing His authority and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' command, representing all future followers of Christ tasked with spreading His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_commission.htm">The Great Commission</a></b><br>The event where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them His commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_end_of_the_age.htm">The End of the Age</a></b><br>A reference to the culmination of history when Christ will return, indicating the perpetual presence of Jesus with His followers until that time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_christ.htm">The Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' command to teach and make disciples is grounded in His divine authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_obedience.htm">The Call to Obedience</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of teaching and obeying all of Jesus' commandments, not just selective ones.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_presence.htm">The Assurance of Presence</a></b><br>Find comfort and courage in the promise that Jesus is with us always, empowering us for the mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_the_mission.htm">The Urgency of the Mission</a></b><br>Understand the urgency of the Great Commission in light of the approaching "end of the age."<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Acknowledge the Holy Spirit's role in enabling believers to fulfill the Great Commission.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_28_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 28:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_teach_obedience_daily.htm">How can we "teach them to obey" in our daily interactions with others?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_I_am_with_you_always.htm">What does "I am with you always" mean for personal challenges we face?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_28_20_Deut_31_6_promises.htm">How does Matthew 28:20 connect with God's promises in Deuteronomy 31:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_feel_Jesus_in_church.htm">In what ways can we experience Jesus' presence in our church community?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_28_20_in_family_life.htm">How can we implement Jesus' teachings in Matthew 28:20 in our family life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_28_20_show_Jesus_presence.htm">How does Matthew 28:20 affirm the presence of Jesus in believers' lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_I_am_with_you_always_2.htm">What does "I am with you always" mean in the context of Matthew 28:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_28_20_s_link_to_Trinity.htm">How does Matthew 28:20 support the doctrine of the Trinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'i_am_with_you'.htm">What did Jesus mean by "I Am with You Always"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_god_greater_than_our_hearts.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'I Am with You Always'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_bible_teachings_cover_caregiving.htm">What biblical teachings address caregiving?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_mary's_perpetual_virginity_doctrine.htm">Is Mary's perpetual virginity a recognized doctrine?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 28:20 Mean</div><b>Teaching Them</b><p>Jesus does not say, &#8220;Inspire them,&#8221;

But we may well believe that they went further than this, and that the words may cover much unrecorded teaching which they had heard in the darkness, and were to reproduce in light (<a href="/matthew/10-27.htm" title="What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you hear in the ear, that preach you on the housetops.">Matthew 10:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I am with you alway.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">all the days,</span> or, <span class= "ital">at all times;</span> the words emphasising continuity more than the English adverb.

Like all such words, its meaning widens or contracts according to our point of view. Here the context determines its significance as stretching forward to the end of the age, or aeon, which began with the first Advent of the Christ and shall last until the second. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the nations) <span class="cmt_word">to observe all things</span>, etc. The word for "teaching" is quite different from that used in ver. 19, and there wrongly translated. Instruction is the second necessary condition for discipleship. In the case of adults, as was said above, some teaching must precede the initiation; but this has to be supplemented subsequently in order to build up the convert in the faith and make him perfect; while infants must be taught "as soon as they are able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession they have here made." All must be taught the Christian faith and duty, and how to obtain God's help to enable them to please him, and to continue in the way of salvation, so that they may "die from sin, and rise again unto righteousness; continually mortifying all their evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and godliness of living" ('Public Baptism of Infants'). "He gives," says St. Chrysostom, "the one charge with a view to doctrine [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the form of baptism], the other concerning commandments" ('Horn.,' 90.). All that Christ commanded, both in doctrine and morals, all that he had taught and enjoined during the three past years, they were henceforward to take as their textbook, and enforce on all who were admitted into the Church by baptism. As the Greek is, "I commanded," being aorist and not perfect, it may be rightly opined that Christ here alludes also to various details which he set forth and enjoined during these great forty days, between his resurrection and ascension, when he gave commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen, and spake to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God (<a href="/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo.</span> "After that, because he had enjoined on them great things, to raise their courage, he <span class="accented">says.</span> Lo! "etc. (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">I am with you alway</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Every word is emphatic. The Ascension was at hand; this implied an absence of his visible presence, to be replaced by a spiritual presence, more perfect, potent, effectual, infinite. It is I myself, I, God and Man,who am (not "will be") henceforward ever present among you, with you as Companion, Friend, Guide, Saviour, God. I am with you in all your ministrations, prayers public and private, baptisms, communions, exhortations, doctrine, discipline And this, not now and then, not at certain times only, but "all the days" of your pilgrimage, all the dark days of trial and persecution and affliction; all the days when you, my apostles, are gathered to your rest, and have committed your work to other hands; my presence shall never be withdrawn for a single moment. Often had God made an analogous promise to his servants under the old dispensation - to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), to Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), to Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>); but this spiritual presence of Christ is something unknown to previous history, a nearness unspeakable, in the Church at large and in the Christian's heart. <span class="cmt_word">Even unto the end of the world;</span> <span class="accented">the consummation of the age</span>, as <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> (where see note). When the new era is ushered in, evangelizing work will cease; God shall be all in all; all shall know him from the least unto the greatest. And they shall ever be with the Lord; "wherefore comfort one another with these words" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>. The word is here an interpolation, but it expresses what every pious reader must say in his heart, "So be it, O Lord; be with us unto the end; guide and strengthen us in life, and bring us safely through the valley of the shadow of death, to thy blessed presence, where is the fulness of joy forevermore!" <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and] teaching</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(didaskontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1321.htm">Strong's 1321: </a> </span><span class="str2">To teach, direct, admonish.
