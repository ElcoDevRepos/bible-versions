Parables were a common teaching method used by Jesus to convey deep spiritual truths through simple stories. The use of parables fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of opening the mouth in parables. This teaching method also served to reveal truths to those who were spiritually receptive while concealing them from those who were not (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>). The completion of these parables signifies a transition in Jesus' ministry, moving from teaching to other activities.<p><b>He withdrew from that place</b><br>The act of withdrawing indicates a deliberate movement by Jesus, often seen in the Gospels when He seeks solitude or when He is moving to a new location for ministry purposes. This withdrawal could be due to the growing opposition from religious leaders or the need for rest and prayer. Geographically, "that place" refers to the region around the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus spent much of His ministry. This movement also reflects the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry, as He traveled throughout Galilee and Judea to preach, teach, and heal. The withdrawal can be seen as a strategic retreat to prepare for the next phase of His mission, emphasizing the importance of timing and divine purpose in His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who taught in parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/parables.htm">Parables</a></b><br>Short, allegorical accounts used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths.
