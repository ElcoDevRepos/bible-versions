In the cultural context of the time, repeating a name was a way to express intimacy or urgency. However, Jesus warns that not all who claim allegiance to Him will be recognized as true followers. This echoes the prophetic warnings in the Old Testament, such as <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. It underscores the importance of sincerity and true commitment in one's relationship with God.<p><b>will enter the kingdom of heaven,</b><br>The "kingdom of heaven" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, referring to God's sovereign rule and the realm where His will is perfectly done. Entrance into this kingdom is not based on mere profession of faith but on a transformative relationship with God. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes obedience and faithfulness as key to participating in God's kingdom, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>, which discusses the relationship between faith and works.<p><b>but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of aligning one's actions with God's will as a criterion for entering the kingdom. The "will of My Father" refers to living according to God's commandments and teachings, as exemplified by Jesus Himself. This is consistent with the teachings found throughout the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus calls His followers to a higher standard of righteousness. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of obedience to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>, where Israel is called to love and serve God with all their heart and soul.

Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?">Matthew 7:16</a> above given. A further development of the same thought is found in <a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>, and we are taught that it is by doing the will of God ourselves, or rather by <span class= "ital">willing</span> to do it, that we gain the power to distinguish, so far as we need distinguish, truth from error, man's teaching from God's.<p>The previous words imply that the disciples had already begun to use the title Lord (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span>) in speaking to their Master (comp. <a href="/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>); but as that word was at the time in common use as one of courtesy (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-6.htm" title="And saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.">Matthew 8:6</a>; <a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>), it would not necessarily follow that they had used it in all the later fulness of its meaning. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - These verses stand in close connexion with vers. 15-20. Seeing that external actions are the result of internal life, it is they, not words nor even miracles (since these may in themselves not be dependent on the inner life, though permitted by the Divine power), by which the true followers of Christ will be finally distinguished from others, and which therefore will alone secure admission to abiding with Christ in the kingdom of heaven. To these verses <a href="/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23-28</a> have many resemblances (cf. also vers. 13, 14, <span class="accented">supra</span>).
