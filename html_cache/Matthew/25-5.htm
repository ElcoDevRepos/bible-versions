This delay symbolizes the period between Christ's first and second coming. The delay tests the readiness and faithfulness of believers, echoing the theme of vigilance found in other parables, such as the Parable of the Ten Virgins. The delay also reflects the patience of God, who desires that none should perish but that all should come to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><b>they all became drowsy</b><br>The drowsiness of the virgins represents the natural human tendency to become complacent over time, especially when expectations are not met immediately. This can be seen as a warning against spiritual lethargy and the importance of maintaining a vigilant and active faith. The idea of spiritual sleepiness is addressed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>, which calls believers to wake from sleep because salvation is nearer now than when they first believed.<p><b>and fell asleep</b><br>Falling asleep here is not condemned in the parable, as both the wise and foolish virgins do so. It suggests the inevitability of human weakness and the need for rest. However, the key difference lies in their preparedness for the bridegroom's arrival. This sleep can be seen as a metaphor for death or the end of life, where one's spiritual readiness is crucial. The call to be prepared is echoed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>, urging believers to stay awake and sober, living in anticipation of Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who is central to the parable and symbolizes His return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_virgins.htm">The Ten Virgins</a></b><br>Symbolize believers who are waiting for the return of Christ.

At such a time even the wise and good are apt to slumber, and the crisis, which is to them, if not to the world at large, as the bridegroom's coming, takes them by surprise; but they have, what the foolish have not, the reserved force of steadfast faith and divine help to fall back upon. We may note that the "delay" in this case is followed by a less glaring form of evil than that in <a href="/matthew/24-48.htm" title="But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming;">Matthew 24:48</a>. Not reckless and brutal greed, but simple apathy and neglect is the fault noted for condemnation.<p><span class= "bld">Slumbered and slept.</span>--The first word implies the "nodding" which indicates the first approach of drowsiness, the second the continuous sleeping.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While the bridegroom tarried</span> (<a href="/matthew/24-48.htm">Matthew 24:48</a>). We may suppose that all had lighted their lamps at first, in expectation of being immediately called to meet the bridegroom. But he came not. The advent of Christ was not to be as speedy as the disciples imagined. No one could divine when it would take place. As St. Augustine says, "Latet ultimus dies, ut observetur omnis dies." See here a figure of each Christian's probation. <span class="cmt_word">They all slumbered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">and slept</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) The first verb implies the nodding and napping of persons sitting up at night; the second means "they began to sleep," actually. All, wise and foolish, did this; so in itself it was not sinful, it was only natural. To such drowsiness the best of Christians are liable. The bow cannot be kept always strung; "Neque semper arcum tendit Apollo." Having made all preparations, the virgins ceased for a while to think of the bridegroom's coming. The Fathers take this sleep to be an image of death, the awaking to be the resurrection, when the difference between the two classes is known and displayed. But this would imply that all the faithful will be dead when the Lord comes, which is contrary to <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>. Nor, on the other hand, is it conceivable that they whose lamps are kept burning till the day of death will be unprovided when the Lord comes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
