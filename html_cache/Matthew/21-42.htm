This interaction occurs during His final week in Jerusalem, a time filled with tension and confrontation. Jesus often used parables and direct quotes from Scripture to challenge the leaders' understanding and authority.<p><b>Have you never read in the Scriptures</b><br>Jesus frequently used this phrase to highlight the religious leaders' lack of understanding of the Scriptures, despite their extensive study. It underscores the irony that those who were supposed to be experts in the Law and Prophets were missing the fulfillment of these texts in Jesus Himself.<p><b>&#8216;The stone the builders rejected</b><br>This phrase is a direct reference to <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>. In the context of the psalm, it speaks of a stone that was initially dismissed but later became essential. Historically, builders would discard stones that did not fit their plans, symbolizing how Jesus was rejected by the Jewish leaders. This rejection is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as Jesus was not the Messiah they expected.<p><b>has become the cornerstone.</b><br>The cornerstone is the most crucial stone in a building's foundation, ensuring the structure's stability and alignment. In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-7</a>), signifying His foundational role in the Church. This transformation from rejected stone to cornerstone illustrates God's sovereign plan and the establishment of a new covenant through Christ.<p><b>This is from the Lord</b><br>This phrase emphasizes divine intervention and purpose. The transformation of the rejected stone into the cornerstone is not a human achievement but an act of God. It highlights the fulfillment of prophecy and God's redemptive plan through Jesus, which was orchestrated by divine will.<p><b>and it is marvelous in our eyes&#8217;?</b><br>The term "marvelous" indicates something extraordinary and beyond human comprehension. This reflects the awe and wonder of God's work in salvation history. The fulfillment of prophecy and the establishment of Jesus as the cornerstone of faith is a cause for worship and amazement among believers. This phrase invites reflection on the unexpected ways God accomplishes His purposes, often contrary to human expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the religious leaders of His time, challenging their understanding of Scripture and their rejection of Him as the Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/religious_leaders.htm">Religious Leaders</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking.

In the primary meaning of the Psalm, the illustration seems to have been drawn from one of the stones, quarried, hewn, and marked, away from the site of the Temple, which the builders, ignorant of the head architect's plans, had put on one side, as having no place in the building, but which was found afterwards to be that on which the completeness of the structure depended, that on which, as the chief corner-stone, the two walls met and were bonded together. The Psalmist saw in this a parable of the choice of David to be king over Israel; perhaps, also, of the choice of Israel itself out of the nations of the world. Elsewhere, as in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>, and in the language of later ages, Christ Himself is the chief corner-stone. Here the context gives a somewhat different application, and "the stone which the builders rejected" is found in the future converts from among the Gentiles, the nation bringing forth the fruits which Israel had not brought forth--the "corner-stone" of the great edifice of the Catholic Church of Christ. This meaning was obviously not incompatible with the other. As the mind of the Psalmist included both David and Israel under the same symbolism, so here the Christ identifies Himself, more or less completely, with the Church which is His body. (Comp. <a href="/context/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did ye never read?</span> It is as though Christ said, "Ye have answered rightly. You profess to know the Scriptures well; do you not, then, apprehend that Holy Writ foretells that concerning Messiah and his enemies which you have just announced?" The imagery is changed, but the subject is the same as in the preceding parable. The vineyard is now a building; the husbandmen are the builders; the Son is the stone. <span class="cmt_word">In the Scriptures.</span> The quotation is from <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22, 23</a> - the same psalm which was used on the day of triumph when Christ was saluted with cries of "Hosanna!" and which, as some say, was first sung by Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles on the return from Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The stone.</span> This figure was generally understood to represent Messiah, on whom depended the existence and support of the kingdom of God. Many prophecies containing this metaphor were applied to him; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>; so that the Pharisees could be at no loss to understand the allusion, seeing that Jesus claimed to be that Stone. <span class="cmt_word">Rejected;</span> as being not suitable to the building, or useless in its construction. So the husbandmen rejected the Son. The ignorance and contempt of men are overruled by the great Architect. <span class="cmt_word">The head of the corner.</span> The cornerstone, which stands at the base and binds together two principal walls (see St. Paul's grand words, <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). We learn that Christ unites Jew and Gentile in one holy house (comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6, 7</a>). This (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>), being feminine, is thought by some to refer to "head of the corner" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but it is better to take it as used by a Hebrew idiom for the neuter, and to refer generally to what has preceded, viz. the settlement of the cornerstone in its destined position, which is effected by the Lord himself. The ultimate victory of the rejected Son is thus distinctly predicted (comp. <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
