The meal was traditionally eaten in a family setting, and Jesus is with His disciples, indicating a close-knit group. The Passover meal included unleavened bread, wine, bitter herbs, and lamb, each symbolizing aspects of the Exodus story. This context highlights the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, as Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper.<p><b>Jesus took bread</b><br>Bread was a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet and held significant symbolic meaning in Jewish culture. It represented sustenance and life. In the context of the Passover, unleavened bread symbolized purity and the haste of the Israelites' departure from Egypt. Jesus taking the bread signifies His role as the provider of spiritual nourishment and life.<p><b>spoke a blessing and broke it</b><br>In Jewish tradition, blessings were spoken over food to thank God for His provision. The act of breaking bread was a common practice, symbolizing sharing and community. Jesus breaking the bread foreshadows His impending sacrifice, where His body would be broken for the salvation of humanity. This act also emphasizes the communal aspect of the meal, as the disciples would share in what Jesus was about to offer.<p><b>and gave it to the disciples</b><br>This gesture of giving the bread to His disciples signifies the impartation of His life and mission to them. It reflects the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers and their participation in His ministry. The act of giving also points to the future mission of the disciples to spread the Gospel, as they are entrusted with the message of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Take and eat; this is My body.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is profound, as Jesus identifies the bread with His body, symbolizing His impending sacrifice on the cross. The command to "take and eat" invites the disciples to partake in the benefits of His sacrifice, signifying acceptance and internalization of His redemptive work. This phrase connects to the concept of Jesus as the Bread of Life, as seen in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, and fulfills the typology of the Passover lamb, whose sacrifice brought deliverance. The phrase also prefigures the Christian practice of Communion, where believers remember and proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who initiates the breaking of bread, symbolizing His body.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present at the Last Supper, receiving the bread from Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The event where Jesus shares a final meal with His disciples before His crucifixion, instituting the practice of Communion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Last Supper takes place, during the time of Passover.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_meal.htm">Passover Meal</a></b><br>The traditional Jewish meal commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, which Jesus reinterprets in light of His impending sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_bread.htm">The Significance of the Bread</a></b><br>The bread represents Jesus' body, broken for us.

In the midst of a meal, He takes, blesses, breaks, and gives, inviting His followers to receive Him wholly. The verse teaches that His sinless life is offered, His suffering is real, His grace is personal, and our response must be active participation in His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">As they were eating.</span>--Again we must represent to ourselves an interval of silence, broken by the act or words that followed. The usual "grace" or blessing had been spoken at the beginning of the feast. Now, taking one of the cakes of unleavened bread, He again utters a solemn formula of blessing, and gives it to them with the words, "Take, eat, this is my body;" or, as in St. Luke's fuller report (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1Corinthians 11:24</a>), "This is My body that is given for you" (literally, <span class= "ital">that is in the act of being given</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> "do this in remembrance of Me" (better, <span class= "ital">as a memorial of Me</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It would be an endless and profitless task to enter into the labyrinth of subtle speculations to which these words have given rise. Did the bread which He thus gave them contain at that moment the substance of His body, taking the place of its own substance or united with it? In what way is He present when those words are repeated and the faithful receive the "sacrament of the body and blood of Christ?" Questions such as these, theories of Transubstantiation, Consubstantiation, and the like, are, we may venture to say, alien to the mind of Christ, and outside the range of any true interpretation. As pointing to the true path through that labyrinth, it will be enough to remember (1) that our Lord's later teaching had accustomed the disciples to language of like figurative boldness. He was "the door of the sheep-fold" (<a href="/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>). What they would understand at the time and afterwards was, that He spoke of His body as being as truly given for them as that bread which He had broken was given to them. (2) That the words could scarcely fail to recall what had once seemed a "hard saying which they could not hear" (<a href="/john/6-60.htm" title="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>). They had been told that they could only enter into eternal life by eating His flesh and drinking His blood--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by sharing His life, and the spirit of sacrifice which led Him to offer it up for the life of the world. Now they were taught that what had appeared impossible was to become possible, through the outward symbol of the bread thus broken. They were to "do this" as a memorial of Him, and so to keep fresh in their remembrance that sacrifice which He had offered. To see in these words, as some have seen, the command, "Offer this as a sacrifice," is to do violence to their natural meaning by reading into them the after-thoughts of theology. (See Notes on <a href="/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19</a>.) But, on the other hand, the word rendered "remembrance" or "memorial" was one not without a sacrificial aspect of its own. Every "sacrifice" was a "remembrance" of man's sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>). Every Paschal Feast was a "memorial" of the first great Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-9.htm" title="Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the entrails thereof.">Exodus 12:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm" title="Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.">Numbers 10:10</a>). So every act such as He now commanded would be a "memorial" at once of the sins which made a sacrifice necessary, and of the one great sacrifice which He had offered. (3) It seems something like a descent to a lower region of thought, but it ought to be noted that the time at which the memorial was thus instituted, "while they were eating," is not without its significance in the controversies which have been raised as to fasting or non-fasting communion. Rules on such a subject, so far as any Church adopts them, or any individual Christian finds them expedient, may have their authority and their value, but the facts of the original institution witness that they rest on no divine authority, and that the Church acts wisely when it leaves the question to every individual Christian to decide as he is "fully persuaded in his own mind" (<a href="/romans/14-5.htm" title="One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.">Romans 14:5</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-29.</span> - <span class="accented">The institution of the Lord's Supper.</span> (<a href="/mark/14-22.htm">Mark 14:22-25</a>; <a href="/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15-20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>.) The endless controversies which have gathered round the Holy Eucharist, for opposite views of the meaning and purpose of which men have fearlessly met death, render it a difficult matter to expound the text succinctly and yet with due regard to clearness and precision. If I do not expatiate upon the diverse opinions which have been held on this momentous subject, it is not because I have neglected to weigh and examine them, but because it is more conducive to edification to have a plain statement of what appears to the writer to be the truth, than to confuse a reader with a multitude of interpretations which in the end have virtually to be surrendered.
