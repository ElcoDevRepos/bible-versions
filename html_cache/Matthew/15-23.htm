In the context of Jewish tradition, silence can be a powerful tool for teaching and reflection. Jesus' lack of immediate response may also highlight the cultural tensions between Jews and Gentiles, as the woman was a Canaanite. This moment echoes other instances in Scripture where God&#8217;s silence is a precursor to a greater revelation or miracle, such as in the story of Job or the period of silence before the birth of Christ.<p><b>So His disciples came and urged Him,</b><br>The disciples' reaction reflects their discomfort and perhaps their own cultural biases. In the Jewish context, interactions with Gentiles were often limited, and the disciples may have been influenced by societal norms. Their urging suggests a desire to maintain social boundaries, yet it also sets the stage for Jesus to teach them about the inclusivity of His mission. This moment is reminiscent of other times when the disciples misunderstood Jesus' intentions, such as when they rebuked those bringing children to Him.<p><b>&#8220;Send her away,</b><br>The disciples' request to send the woman away indicates their lack of understanding of Jesus' mission to all people, not just the Jews. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where the disciples struggle to grasp the full scope of Jesus' ministry. The phrase can also be seen as a test for the woman, challenging her persistence and faith. It parallels other instances where Jesus initially seems to reject a request, only to later fulfill it in a way that demonstrates His power and compassion.<p><b>for she keeps crying out after us.&#8221;</b><br>The woman's persistence is a key element in this narrative, demonstrating her faith and desperation. Her continual crying out is reminiscent of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18</a>, who also received what she sought through perseverance. This persistence is a model of faith for believers, showing that earnest and unwavering prayer can lead to divine intervention. The cultural context of a woman publicly pleading with a Jewish rabbi would have been unusual, highlighting her desperation and the breaking of social norms to seek help from Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is approached by a Canaanite woman seeking healing for her daughter.

That which has found favour with nearly all ancient and most modern interpreters assumes that from the first He had purposed to comply with her request, and spoke as He did only to test and manifest her faith. Men have been unwilling to recognise the possibility of a change of purpose in the human nature of our Lord which they, unconsciously heretical, confused with the divine, and have preferred to fall back on the supposition of a simulated harshness. The truer and more reverential course, I venture to think, is to accept the impression which, apart from any <span class= "ital">a priori</span> theory, the facts seem naturally to make, and to see, in what passed, the prevailing power of prayer working on the sympathy of Christ, and leading Him to pass beyond the ordinary limits of His appointed work. On this assumption, it is our work to trace, with all reverence, the successive stages of the process. And first, even the silence is significant, and implies a conflict. It would have been easy to dismiss her with a word. But the tenderness which He felt towards this sufferer, as towards others, forbade that course, and yet the sense of the normal limitation of His work forbade the other. Silence was the natural outcome of the equilibrium of these conflicting motives.<p><span class= "bld">Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span>--The disciples were clearly unable to enter into either of the two feelings which were thus contending for the mastery. Their words, as interpreted by our Lord's answer, were, in some sense, a plea in favour of the woman. They wished Him to grant what she asked for, and so to dismiss her. And yet we feel that their words were far harsher than their Master's silence. They wanted only to be rid of her presence, which had followed them from the streets into the house, to be freed from the loud eager cries which vexed them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Answered her not a word.</span> The woman made no specific request; she had not brought the sufferer with her, and entreated Christ to exorcise the evil influence; she did not urge him to go to her house, and by his gracious presence work a cure. Simply she tells her affliction, and lets the woeful tale plead for itself. But there was no response. The Merciful is obdurate; the Physician withholds his aid; in the face of misery, to the voice of entreaty, the Lord is silent. It is the discipline of love; he acts as though he hears not, that he may bring forth perseverance and faith. <span class="cmt_word">Send her away.</span> There is some doubt concerning the feeling of the apostles in thus addressing Christ. Did they wish him to grant her virtual petition or not? On the one hand, it is urged that they were thoroughly annoyed at her importunity. They had sought for quiet' and privacy, and now this woman was bringing a crowd around them, and occasioning the very notoriety which they wished to avoid. Their Jewish prejudices, too, were aroused by this appeal from a Canaanite; they could not endure the idea that favour should be extended to this Gentile of an abhorred race; hence they desire Christ to dismiss her at once, give her a decided rejection. On the other hand, the answer of Christ to their request leads to another explanation, as if he understood them to be asking him to grant her prayer. And this is undoubtedly what they did want, though they did not presume to prescribe the manner or to beg for a miracle. They range themselves on the woman's side, not from any genuine compassion, but from mere selfishness. The ground of their appeal is, <span class="cmt_word">She crieth after us.</span> The appeal had been first made in the open street, and the Canaanite had followed them, as they moved, continuing her piteous cry, and thus attracting attention to them and defeating their hope of retirement and rest. So they, for their own peace and comfort, ask Christ to grant the prayer of this obstinate suppliant: "Give her what she wants, and have done with her." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] did not answer</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a word.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(logon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3056.htm">Strong's 3056: </a> </span><span class="str2">From lego; something said; by implication, a topic, also reasoning or motive; by extension, a computation; specially, the Divine Expression.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
