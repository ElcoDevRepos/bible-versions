The story is found in the Book of Jonah, specifically <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>. The "three days and three nights" is a Hebrew idiom for a period that includes parts of three days, not necessarily 72 hours. This event is a type of Christ's death, burial, and resurrection, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. Jonah's experience prefigures Jesus' own death and resurrection, serving as a prophetic sign to the people of Jesus' time.<p><b>so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth</b><br>The term "Son of Man" is a messianic title that Jesus frequently used for Himself, emphasizing both His humanity and His divine authority. The "heart of the earth" refers to Jesus' burial and His descent into the grave following His crucifixion. This phrase underscores the reality of Jesus' death and His physical entombment. The parallel to Jonah highlights the miraculous nature of Jesus' resurrection, as Jonah's emergence from the fish was seen as a sign of God's power and mercy. This prophecy is fulfilled in the New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection on the third day, as recorded in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28:1-10</a>, <a href="/mark/16.htm">Mark 16:1-8</a>, <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24:1-12</a>, <a href="/john/20.htm">John 20:1-18</a>).

And he left them, and departed.">Matthew 16:4</a>. In the other passages "the sign of the prophet Jonas" appears with a vague mysteriousness, unexplained. Not a few critics have accordingly inferred from this difference that the explanation given by St. Matthew was an addition to the words actually spoken by our Lord, and that "the sign of the prophet Jonas" was sufficiently fulfilled by His preaching repentance to the wicked and adulterous generation as Jonah had done to the Ninevites. Against this view, however, it may be urged:--(1) That Jonah's work as a preacher was not a "sign" in any sense, and that nothing in his history had this character, except the two narratives of the whale (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm" title="Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.">Jonah 1:17</a>) and the gourd (<a href="/context/jonah/4-6.htm" title="And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.">Jonah 4:6-10</a>). Any reference to the latter is, of course, out of the question; and it remains therefore, in any case, that we must look to the former as that to which our Lord alluded. (2) That the very difficulty presented by the prediction of "three days and three nights" as compared with the six-and-thirty hours (two nights and one day) of the actual history of the Resurrection, is against the probability of the verse having been inserted as a prophecy after the event. (3) That if we believe that our Lord had a distinct prevision of His resurrection, and foretold it, sometimes plainly and sometimes in dark sayings--and of this the Gospels leave no room for doubt (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-32.htm" title="But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.">Matthew 26:32</a>; <a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>)--then the history of Jonah presented an analogy which it was natural that He should notice. It does not necessarily follow that this use of the history as a prophetic symbol of the Resurrection requires us to accept it in the very letter of its details. It was enough, for the purposes of the illustration, that it was familiar and generally accepted. The purely chronological difficulty is explained by the common mode of speech among the Jews, according to which, any part of a day, though it were but a single hour, was for legal purposes considered as a whole. An instance of this mode of speech is found in <a href="/context/1_samuel/30-12.htm" title="And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.">1Samuel 30:12-13</a>, and it is possible that in the history of Jonah itself the measurement of time is to be taken with the same laxity. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">For as Jonas</span> (<span class="accented">Jonah</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">was three days and three nights in the whale's belly</span>. Verbally from the LXX. of <a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a> (2:1). <span class="cmt_word">So shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth</span>. Since, so far as the balance of evidence goes (cf., however, Bishop Westcott, 'Introduction,' p. 344, edit. 1872), the Crucifixion was on Friday and the Resurrection on Sunday, the actual time between them was only one clear day and two parts of days (which might fairly be called three days) and two whole nights. The reckoning, therefore, here is, strictly speaking, inaccurate. The words are perhaps a mere adaptation of the phrase in Jonah, and are here used only to roughly mark the time of our Lord's stay in the grave. Observe, however, that the addition of" nights" tends to emphasize the reality of our Lord's stay there. It was a matter of days and nights; he spent both kinds of earthly time "in the heart of the earth" (cf. <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>, note). It will be noticed that the inaccuracy of the wording would, if modern Western habits were alone to be considered, make it most unlikely that the phrase is a later addition; but in view of the early Christian and Jewish method of illustrating events by passages of Scripture which do not apply in all respects, the improbability is not so great as would at first sight appear. However, upon our present information, we must say that the phrase was spoken by our Lord himself, and that although the exact time of his stay in the grave was well known to the early believers, they continued to repeat the saying in the form in which the Lord left it. In <span class="accented">the heart of the earth.</span> The form of the expression is derived from <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a> (4), "in the heart of the seas" (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>), and would therefore appear to mean some deeper place than the rock-hewn sepulchre. Hence many commentators, beginning with Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' V. 31.) and Tertullian ('De Anima,' Iv.), understand it as directly denoting the place of departed spirits. <a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> ("the lower parts of the earth"), on the contrary, probably refers to the earth as such in contrast to heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/12-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
