In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, fasting was sometimes used to display piety publicly. Jesus warns against this, emphasizing sincerity over showmanship. The Pharisees, known for their strict adherence to the law, often fasted twice a week and made their fasting visible to others. This phrase underscores the importance of humility and the internalization of spiritual practices, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God valuing the heart's intentions over outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>but only to your Father, who is unseen</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate and personal relationship between the believer and God. The "unseen" nature of the Father contrasts with the visible acts of piety that some might perform for human approval. It reflects the theological understanding that God is omnipresent and omniscient, aware of all actions and intentions. This aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, where God's knowledge of the individual is profound and all-encompassing. The emphasis is on the authenticity of one's faith and devotion, which should be directed towards God rather than human recognition.<p><b>And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you</b><br>The promise of divine reward for sincere devotion is a recurring theme in Scripture. This assurance is not necessarily of material or earthly rewards but of spiritual blessings and eternal significance. The concept of God seeing "what is done in secret" reinforces His omniscience and the idea that nothing is hidden from Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This teaching encourages believers to focus on their relationship with God, trusting that He will honor their genuine acts of faith. The reward mentioned can be understood in light of the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where Jesus speaks of the blessings for those who live according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which includes teachings on various aspects of righteous living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God, who is unseen and rewards those who seek Him in sincerity and humility.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all believers who seek to follow His instructions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, a collection of Jesus' teachings found in Matthew chapters 5-7, addressing the heart of the law and true righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fasting.htm">Fasting</a></b><br>A spiritual discipline involving abstaining from food (or other things) to focus on prayer and seeking God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_in_worship.htm">Sincerity in Worship</a></b><br>True fasting is about seeking God with a sincere heart, not about gaining human approval.
