The context is the aftermath of Jesus walking on water and calming the storm, demonstrating His authority over nature. The Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in Israel, was a central location for Jesus' ministry and many of His miracles. The disciples, being fishermen, were familiar with the sea, yet they were still amazed by Jesus' power.<p><b>worshiped Him,</b><br>The act of worship here indicates a recognition of Jesus' divine nature. In Jewish culture, worship was reserved for God alone, suggesting that the disciples were beginning to understand Jesus' true identity. This moment marks a significant development in their faith journey, as they move from seeing Jesus as a teacher and miracle worker to acknowledging His divinity.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Truly You are the Son of God!&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a profound confession of faith. The title "Son of God" is significant in both Jewish and Christian theology, indicating a unique relationship with God the Father. This acknowledgment by the disciples connects to earlier scriptural prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the anointed one as God's Son. It also foreshadows Peter's later confession in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a> and aligns with the purpose of John's Gospel, which is to show that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).

the Twelve, already eyewitnesses to countless miracles that very day (the feeding of the five thousand, <a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence in the boat was by Jesus&#8217; command (<a href="/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22</a>), showing that obedience often positions us to witness His power.<p>&#8226; Like them, believers form a community shaped by shared

Now His own followers bow.<p>&#8226; Jesus accepts their worship without rebuke, affirming His deity (contrast <a href="/acts/10-25.htm">Acts 10:25-26</a> where Peter rejects worship).<p>&#8226; Later, they will worship again at His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9, 17</a>) and ascension (<a href="/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saying</b><p>Their worship is not silent; they confess aloud.<p>&#8226; Genuine faith speaks (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Confession cements belief not just privately but before others (<a href="/psalms/107-2.htm">Psalm 107:2</a> &#8220;Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Truly</b><p>This adverb underscores certainty&#8212;no guesswork, no hesitation.<p>&#8226; Similar affirmations appear after other signs (<a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Storm-calming power leaves no room for half-hearted conclusions: Jesus is exactly who He claims to be.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are the Son of God!</b><p>The heart of the verse and of Christian confession.<p>&#8226; Echoed later by Peter (&#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,&#8221; <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>) and by Thomas (&#8220;My Lord and my God,&#8221; <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Declares both messianic identity (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>) and divine nature (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Sets the stage for the Gospel&#8217;s ultimate purpose: &#8220;so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a> records the disciples&#8217; immediate, verbal, and heartfelt response to Jesus&#8217; mastery over nature: worship. Their declaration, &#8220;Truly You are the Son of God,&#8221; is the first corporate confession of His deity within the Gospel. In that calm boat they move from fear to faith, from questioning to certainty, modeling the response every believer is called to make when confronted with the undeniable power and presence of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">They that were in the ship.</span>--The peculiar description was apparently intended to distinguish them from Peter and the other disciples, and probably indicates that they were the crew of the boat, or some chance passengers, who had no previous knowledge of our Lord and of His works. They too were led, in that moment of wonder, to the confession that the Prophet of Nazareth was more than man, and in this, as far as the Gospel record goes, they anticipated the faith even of the foremost of the disciples. It is significant that Peter's confession that He was "the Son of God," or "the Holy One of God" (<a href="/john/6-69.htm" title="And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.">John 6:69</a>), follows shortly upon this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> - and (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">they that were in the ship;</span> boat (Revised Version).

The word seems to imply that the suggestion did not enter their minds now for the first time. Two had, perhaps, heard the words spoken at the baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>), and most of them, if not all, the utterance by the demons in <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>. Yet these utterances in reality far surpassed what they even nosy imagined (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou art the Son of</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>). Although the phrase is not of the definite form found in <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a> and Matthew 16:16, where it is used with express reference to the Messiahship of Jesus (cf. for the intermediate form, <a href="/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a> with 43), yet it is impossible to take it here as merely referring to a moral relation between Jesus and God. In <a href="/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a> this might be sufficient (Luke has "righteous"); but here there is no question of coming up to a standard of moral uprightness, but rather of manifestation of power, and this is connected with Messiah. His authority over the elements leads to the homage of those who witness its exercise, and forces from them the expression that he is the promised Representative of God on earth (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>, note). Observe, however, that not even so is it a profession of faith in his absolute Divinity.
