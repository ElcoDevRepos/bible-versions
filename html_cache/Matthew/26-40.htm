The garden, located at the foot of the Mount of Olives, was a place Jesus often visited with His disciples. The disciples' inability to stay awake highlights human frailty and the struggle against spiritual lethargy. This moment underscores the contrast between Jesus' vigilance and the disciples' weakness, reflecting the broader theme of spiritual readiness found throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Were you not able to keep watch with Me for one hour?&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' question emphasizes the importance of spiritual alertness and the need for prayer, especially in times of trial. The "one hour" signifies a relatively short period, suggesting that the disciples' failure was not due to an unreasonable demand. This moment foreshadows the coming trials and the need for perseverance in faith. The call to "keep watch" is echoed in other parts of the New Testament, such as in <a href="/mark/13-33.htm">Mark 13:33-37</a>, where believers are urged to be vigilant for the Lord's return.<p><b>He asked Peter.</b><br>Peter, often seen as the leader among the disciples, is specifically addressed, highlighting his prominent role and the expectations placed upon him. This moment is significant in light of Peter's earlier declaration of unwavering loyalty to Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-33.htm">Matthew 26:33-35</a>). It serves as a precursor to Peter's later denial of Christ, illustrating the tension between human intentions and actions. Peter's experience is a reminder of the need for humility and reliance on God's strength rather than one's own resolve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane, experiencing deep sorrow and distress as He prepares for His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, Peter is specifically addressed by Jesus in this verse, highlighting his failure to stay awake and pray.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers who accompanied Him to the garden.

Returning from fervent prayer, Jesus finds His closest friends asleep, unable to stand guard for even an hour. His question to Peter exposes self-reliance and calls all disciples to alert, prayerful dependence. The verse reminds us that sharing in the Lord&#8217;s mission requires spiritual vigilance sustained by communion with Him, lest temptation overtake us in our weakness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">He cometh unto the disciples.</span>--Perhaps to both the groups--first of the three and then of the eight.

He had boasted of his readiness to do great things. He could not so much as rouse himself to watch for one hour. The last word may be fairly taken as partly measuring the time that had passed since their Master had left them. As the words are reported we must believe that the disciples were just so far roused as to hear them, and that they sank back powerless into slumber.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh unto the disciples</span>. He rose from prayer and returned to his three apostles, seeking their sympathy and the comfort of their presence in his lonely desolation. <span class="cmt_word">Findeth them asleep;</span> <span class="accented">sleeping.</span> The comfort which his man's nature craved was denied him. St. Luke, the physician, says that the disciples were "sleeping for sorrow." Some great mental shock, some poignant distress, often produces a bodily stupor and sleep; but this is scarcely a valid excuse for such insensibility at this terrible crisis, especially as the Lord had urged them to watch (ver. 38). They had had a very trying day; Peter and John had undergone much bodily fatigue in preparing the last Supper; they were all weary, full of grief, and weighed down by foreboding; it was no wonder that they succumbed to these influences, though we might have expected that such as they would have risen superior to them. "The simple law, that extraordinary tension raises the highly developed spiritual life, while it stupefies the less developed, finds here its strongest illustration in the almost absolute contrast of spiritual watchfulness and sleep" (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">Saith unto Peter.</span> Peter had been most forward in profession (vers. 33, 35); so Christ addresses him first. The other two, James and John, bad boldly asserted that they were able to drink of Christ's cup of suffering (<a href="/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>); so they are included in the tender reproach. <span class="cmt_word">What</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>could ye not watch with me?</span> <span class="accented">So, could ye not</span>, etc.?
