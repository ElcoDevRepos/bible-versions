The "governor" mentioned here is Pontius Pilate, the Roman official overseeing Judea. Historically, Pilate was known for his pragmatic approach to governance, often prioritizing political stability over strict adherence to justice. The Jewish leaders were worried that the report of Jesus' resurrection could cause unrest or challenge their authority, as Jesus had been a significant figure with a large following. This reflects the tension between the Jewish authorities and the Roman government, as well as the delicate balance they maintained to keep peace in the region.<p><b>we will satisfy him</b><br>The Jewish leaders promise to "satisfy" Pilate, indicating their intention to appease him and prevent any negative consequences for the soldiers. This suggests a level of influence or leverage they believed they had over Pilate, possibly due to their previous interactions, such as during Jesus' trial. It also highlights the political maneuvering common in that era, where leaders often engaged in negotiations and compromises to maintain their positions and avoid conflict. This assurance implies a willingness to use resources, possibly financial or political, to ensure Pilate's cooperation.<p><b>and keep you out of trouble.&#8221;</b><br>The promise to "keep you out of trouble" is directed at the soldiers who were guarding Jesus' tomb. Roman soldiers faced severe penalties for failing in their duties, including execution. The Jewish leaders' assurance indicates their commitment to protecting the soldiers from such consequences, likely to ensure their silence and cooperation. This reflects the broader theme of the resurrection narrative, where various parties attempt to suppress the truth of Jesus' resurrection. It also underscores the lengths to which the Jewish leaders were willing to go to maintain their narrative and prevent the spread of Christianity, which they saw as a threat to their authority and religious traditions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who were responsible for maintaining Jewish law and order.

For a Roman soldier to sleep on his post was to incur the penalty of death. Pilate would not be likely to hear of what had taken place, as vulgar rumours were not encouraged by his stern and unsympathizing attitude towards the Jewish people, but it was just possible that some officious person might bring the report before him, and ask him to take measures to ascertain the truth, and, if necessary, to punish the delinquents. <span class="cmt_word">We</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">will persuade him.</span> Such persuasion usually took the form of bribery, Roman officials being notoriously venal (comp. <a href="/acts/24-26.htm">Acts 24:26</a>); but perhaps the rulers intended to make him believe that the story was not true, but merely a <span class="accented">ruse</span> to keep the populace quiet.

Pilate, however, later learned the great fact of Christ's resurrection, and though, as far as we know, he took no steps towards punishing the guard (being probably convinced of its supernatural occurrence), yet, according to a fragment of Hegesippus, and Eusebius, 'Chronic.,' 2:2, he sent an account of the matter to Tiberius, who, in consequence, endeavoured to make the senate pass a decree enrolling Jesus in the list of Roman gods. This fact is attested by Tertullian ('Apolog.,' 5.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
