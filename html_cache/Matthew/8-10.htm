The centurion's understanding of authority and his belief in Jesus' power to command healing without physical presence is significant. It highlights the centurion's insight into Jesus' divine authority, which was uncommon even among the Jewish people.<p><b>He marveled</b><br>Jesus' reaction of marveling is noteworthy because it is rare for Him to be described as amazed. This indicates the extraordinary nature of the centurion's faith. In the Gospels, Jesus is often the one who amazes others with His teachings and miracles, but here, the faith of a Gentile centurion amazes Him, underscoring the depth and sincerity of the centurion's belief.<p><b>and said to those following Him</b><br>Jesus addresses His followers, which likely included His disciples and the crowd that often accompanied Him. This public declaration serves as a teaching moment, emphasizing the importance of faith. It also contrasts the centurion's faith with the often-lacking faith of the Jewish people, including His own disciples at times.<p><b>Truly I tell you</b><br>This phrase is a solemn affirmation, often used by Jesus to introduce a significant truth. It underscores the importance of what He is about to say, drawing attention to the lesson He wants His followers to learn from the centurion's example.<p><b>I have not found anyone in Israel</b><br>Jesus' statement highlights the unexpected nature of the centurion's faith, especially since he is a Gentile. Israel, God's chosen people, had the Law and the Prophets, yet Jesus had not encountered such faith among them. This serves as a critique of the spiritual state of Israel and a reminder of the openness of God's kingdom to all who believe.<p><b>with such great faith</b><br>The centurion's faith is described as "great," indicating its exceptional quality. This faith is characterized by trust in Jesus' authority and power, without the need for physical evidence or presence. It foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the kingdom of God and serves as a model for the kind of faith that pleases God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer commanding a hundred soldiers, demonstrating humility and faith in Jesus' authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, representing the people among whom Jesus ministered and where He expected to find faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/followers_of_jesus.htm">Followers of Jesus</a></b><br>The disciples and others who were present with Jesus, witnessing His teachings and miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The town where this event takes place, serving as a significant location for Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_borders.htm">Faith Beyond Borders</a></b><br>The centurion's faith is a powerful reminder that true faith transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries.

Contrast "and he marvelled because of their unbelief" (<a href="/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>). We read in <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24, 25</a>, "But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men, and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man." Yet here our Lord marvels at the character of the centurion. How can we reconcile these two statements? As yet not fully, for the question takes us to the centre of our Lord's personality. But we must remember: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That Augustine's solution - Christ did not so much actually wonder, as commend to us that which was worthy of our admiration - "brings an unreality into parts of our Lord's conduct, as though he did some things for show and the effect which they would have on others, instead of all his actions having their deepest root in his own nature, being the truthful exponents of his own inmost being" (Trench). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That St. John was referring, as it seems, to persons with whom our Lord was brought into contact, while here the centurion is probably absent (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Our Lord's powers of perception (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, John) have here had no opportunity of action. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That, in any case, even our Lord's mental powers did not act in any unnatural method. In his grasping the true character of each man's mind, the same processes (however rapid in his case) must have taken place as take place in men generally, and among these processes is wonder at some fresh trait.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard [this],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
