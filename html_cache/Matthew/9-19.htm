The context here is that a synagogue leader, Jairus, has approached Jesus, pleading for the healing of his daughter. Jesus' immediate response to get up and go with Jairus shows His authority and willingness to engage with those in need, regardless of their social status. This action reflects the fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah being a shepherd to His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>. It also illustrates the incarnational aspect of Jesus' ministry, where He physically moves towards those who seek Him, embodying the presence of God among His people.<p><b>along with His disciples</b><br>The presence of the disciples underscores the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry. They are witnesses to His miracles and teachings, learning directly from His actions and words. This journey with Jesus is part of their discipleship training, preparing them for their future roles in spreading the Gospel. The disciples' presence also serves to authenticate the events that occur, as they later become the primary sources of the Gospel accounts. This phrase connects to the broader theme of discipleship in the New Testament, where followers of Christ are called to walk with Him, learn from Him, and eventually carry on His mission, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ruler.htm">The Ruler</a></b><br>A synagogue leader who approaches Jesus with faith, seeking healing for his daughter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who accompany Him, learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Jesus responding to the ruler's plea by going to his house, demonstrating His compassion and willingness to help those in need.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The ruler's approach to Jesus exemplifies active faith.
