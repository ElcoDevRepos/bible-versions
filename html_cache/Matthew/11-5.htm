In biblical context, blindness often represents spiritual ignorance or lack of understanding (<a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>). Jesus' healing of the blind fulfills messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which foretells the opening of the eyes of the blind as a sign of the Messiah's arrival. This act demonstrates Jesus' authority over physical and spiritual realms, affirming His identity as the promised Savior.<p><b>The lame walk</b><br>The healing of the lame signifies restoration and wholeness, both physically and spiritually. In the Old Testament, the inability to walk often symbolizes spiritual paralysis or sin (<a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>). Jesus' ability to make the lame walk fulfills prophecies and showcases His compassion and divine power. This miracle serves as a testament to His role as the Redeemer who restores what is broken, offering new life and hope.<p><b>The lepers are cleansed</b><br>Leprosy in biblical times was a dreaded disease, rendering individuals ceremonially unclean and socially isolated (Leviticus 13-14). Jesus' cleansing of lepers not only demonstrates His power over physical ailments but also His willingness to reach out to the marginalized and restore them to community and worship. This act reflects the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is anointed to bring healing and freedom.<p><b>The deaf hear</b><br>The restoration of hearing to the deaf is another sign of the Messiah's arrival, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. This miracle symbolizes the opening of spiritual ears to hear and understand God's truth. Jesus' healing of the deaf illustrates His mission to break down barriers that prevent people from receiving the gospel, emphasizing His role as the Light of the World who brings understanding and revelation.<p><b>The dead are raised</b><br>Raising the dead is the ultimate demonstration of Jesus' authority over life and death, affirming His divine nature. This act foreshadows His own resurrection and the promise of eternal life for believers. Instances such as the raising of Lazarus (John 11) highlight Jesus' power to conquer death, offering hope and assurance of resurrection to all who believe in Him.<p><b>And the good news is preached to the poor</b><br>Preaching the good news to the poor fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a> and underscores Jesus' mission to bring salvation to all, regardless of social or economic status. The "poor" in this context can refer to those who are materially impoverished as well as those who are spiritually needy. Jesus' message of the kingdom of God is inclusive, offering grace and redemption to everyone, emphasizing the transformative power of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing miracles and fulfilling Messianic prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The one who sent his disciples to ask Jesus if He was the expected Messiah, prompting Jesus' response in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind,_lame,_lepers,_deaf,_dead,_and_poor.htm">The Blind, Lame, Lepers, Deaf, Dead, and Poor</a></b><br>Representing those who are physically and spiritually afflicted, whom Jesus came to heal and save.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus performed many of His miracles and preached the good news.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_prophecies.htm">Messianic Prophecies</a></b><br>Old Testament prophecies that foretold the coming of the Messiah, which Jesus fulfills through His works.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_as_the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Jesus as the Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' miracles confirm His identity as the promised Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_marginalized.htm">Compassion for the Marginalized</a></b><br>Jesus' ministry emphasizes care for the physically and spiritually needy, setting an example for believers to follow.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_gospel.htm">The Power of the Gospel</a></b><br>The good news is transformative, offering hope and salvation to all, especially the poor and oppressed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_healing.htm">Faith and Healing</a></b><br>Physical healing in Jesus' ministry often parallels spiritual healing, inviting believers to seek both.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuing_jesus'_mission.htm">Continuing Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Believers are called to continue Jesus' work by spreading the gospel and serving those in need.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_11_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 11:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_5_Jesus_fulfills_prophecy.htm">How does Matthew 11:5 demonstrate Jesus fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?

Each miracle is literal, verifiable, and prophetic, confirming that the kingdom has broken in and that Christ alone conquers darkness, disability, disease, deafness, death, and despair. The verse calls every reader to recognize Him, trust Him, and share the same life-giving good news with a world still longing for sight, strength, cleansing, hearing, life, and hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The blind receive their sight.</span>--Apparently no facts were stated which might not have already come to the ears of the Baptist. At least one instance of each class of miracle has already been recorded by St. Matthew, the blind (<a href="/matthew/9-27.htm" title="And when Jesus departed there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us.">Matthew 9:27</a>), the lame (<a href="/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>), the leper (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>), the dead (<a href="/matthew/9-25.htm" title="But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.">Matthew 9:25</a>). The raising of the widow's son at Nain, which in St. Luke follows closely upon the healing of the centurion's servant, must also have preceded what is here narrated. What the Baptist needed was, not the knowledge of fresh facts, but a different way of looking at those he already knew. Where these works were done, there were tokens that the coming One had indeed come. But above all signs and wonders, there was another spiritual note of the kingdom, which our Lord reserves as the last and greatest: <span class= "ital">Poor men have the good news proclaimed to them.</span> They are invited to the kingdom, and told of peace and pardon. It is as though our Lord knew that the Baptist, whose heart was with the poor, would feel that One who thus united power and tenderness could be none other than the expected King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>, Revised Version), <span class="cmt_word">the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span> The first and the last of the examples selected by our Lord are fulfilments or' prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).
