Peter, James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, were part of Jesus' inner circle, often witnessing significant events such as the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>). Their presence underscores the importance of fellowship and support in times of trial. The selection of these three disciples also reflects their future roles as leaders in the early church. The sons of Zebedee, James and John, were known for their zeal, earning the nickname "Sons of Thunder" (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>), which may indicate their passionate commitment to Jesus' mission.<p><b>and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed</b><br>This phrase reveals the humanity of Jesus, as He experiences profound emotional turmoil. The Greek words used here, "lupeisthai" (sorrowful) and "ademonein" (deeply distressed), convey intense grief and anxiety. This moment in the Garden of Gethsemane is pivotal, as it precedes His crucifixion. Jesus' sorrow fulfills the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, who is "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." His distress also prefigures the agony He would endure on the cross, bearing the weight of humanity's sin.

Their professions of devotion justified, as it were, the belief that they, at least, could "watch and pray" with Him. The nearness and sympathy of friends were precious even when personal solitude was felt to be a necessity.<p><span class= "bld">And began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span>--The Greek word for the latter verb occurs only here, in the parallel passage of <a href="/mark/14-33.htm" title="And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;">Mark 14:33</a>, and <a href="/philippians/2-26.htm" title="For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick.">Philippians 2:26</a>, where it is translated "full of heaviness." Its primary meaning is thought by some philologists to have been that of "satiety," hence, "loathing" and "ill at ease." Others, however, find its root-thought in being "far from home," and so weary and perplexed. There is, it is obvious, a mysterious contrast between the calm, triumphant serenity which had shone in the look and tone of the Son of Man up to this point, and had reached its highest point in the prayer of John 17, and the anguish and distress that were now apparent. The change has, however, its manifold analogies in the experience of those who are nearest to their Master in sufferings and character. They, too, know how suddenly they may pass from confidence and joy as to a horror of great darkness. And in His sufferings we must remember there was an element absolutely unique. It was His to "tread the wine-press" alone (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm" title="I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.">Isaiah 63:3</a>). It was not only, as it might be with other martyrs, the natural shrinking of man's nature from pain and death, nor yet the pain of finding treachery and want of true devotion where there had been the promise of faithfulness. The intensity of His sympathy at that moment made the sufferings and sins of mankind His own, and the burden of those sins weighed upon His soul as greater than He could bear (<a href="/context/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter and the two sons of Zebedee.</span> These three had been privileged to behold his transfiguration, and that glimpse of his glory strengthened them to bear the partial sight of their dear Lord's sufferings. Did his human heart crave for sympathy, and did he desire not to be utterly alone at this awful crisis? We may well suppose so, as he was true Man, with all man's feelings and sensibilities. <span class="cmt_word">Began to be sorrowful and very heavy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to be sore dismayed</span>). This word seems to be used of the dismay that comes with an unexpected calamity.
