In the cultural context of the time, begging was a sign of humility and recognition of one's need. The people recognized Jesus as a healer and miracle worker, which is consistent with His growing reputation throughout the region. This act of begging also reflects the acknowledgment of Jesus' authority and power, similar to the faith of the centurion in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>.<p><b>just to let them touch</b><br>Touching was a significant act in Jewish culture, often associated with the transfer of power or blessing. In the Old Testament, touching the Ark of the Covenant or the altar was considered sacred. Here, the act of touching Jesus' garment signifies faith in His divine power. This mirrors the faith of the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>, who believed that touching Jesus' cloak would heal her.<p><b>the fringe of His cloak.</b><br>The fringe, or tassel, of a cloak was part of the traditional Jewish garment, known as the "tzitzit," commanded in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a> as a reminder of God's commandments. By seeking to touch the fringe, the people were not only reaching out for physical healing but also symbolically connecting with the divine law and promises of God. This act underscores Jesus' role as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>And all who touched Him were healed.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the completeness and universality of Jesus' healing power. It reflects the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of healing through the Messiah's suffering. The phrase also highlights the theme of faith leading to healing, a recurring motif in the Gospels. The healing of all who touched Him demonstrates Jesus' compassion and the accessibility of His power to those who believe, regardless of their status or background.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one whom the people seek for healing.
