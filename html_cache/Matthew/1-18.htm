The term "Jesus Christ" combines His human name, Jesus, with His title, Christ, meaning "Anointed One" or "Messiah," fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. This introduction sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus.<p><b>His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph:</b><br>Mary's betrothal to Joseph was a formal engagement, legally binding in Jewish culture, akin to marriage but without cohabitation. This period was significant in Jewish customs, often lasting about a year, during which the couple was considered husband and wife, though they did not live together. Joseph, a descendant of David, connects Jesus to the royal lineage, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.<p><b>but before they came together:</b><br>This phrase indicates that Mary and Joseph had not yet consummated their marriage, highlighting the miraculous nature of Jesus' conception. The emphasis on their abstinence underscores the divine intervention in Jesus' birth, maintaining Mary's virginity as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>.<p><b>she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit:</b><br>Mary's pregnancy by the Holy Spirit signifies the miraculous and divine origin of Jesus, affirming His identity as the Son of God. This conception fulfills the prophecy of a virgin birth and establishes Jesus' dual nature as fully God and fully man.

Together these elements affirm that Jesus is both fully God and fully man, the promised Messiah entering history exactly as foretold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) St. Matthew, for some reason or other, omits all mention of what St. Luke relates very fully, as to the events that preceded the birth of Jesus and brought about the birth at Bethlehem. Either he had not access to any document full and trustworthy, like that which St. Luke made use of, or, as every writer of history must fix a beginning more or less arbitrary, he found his starting-point in those facts which took a foremost place in what bore upon the fulfilment of Messianic prophecy. It has been said that the impression left by his narrative is so far misleading, that it suggests the idea that there was no earlier connection with Nazareth than that which we find in 2:23. It must, however, be remembered that even St. Luke's narrative tells us nothing as to the original home of Joseph, and that one who himself belonged to Bethlehem, as being of the house and lineage of David, might, without any improbability, be betrothed to a maiden of Nazareth, probably of the same lineage. Of the earlier life of Mary the Canonical Gospels tell us nothing, and the Apocryphal Gospels (though they have furnished the groundwork of the treatment of the subject by Christian art--see Notes on <a href="/luke/1-27.htm" title="To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.">Luke 1:27</a>) are too legendary to be relied on. The omission of any mention of her parents suggests the idea of orphanhood, possibly under the guardianship of Joseph. The non-appearance of Joseph in the records of our Lord's ministry, makes it probable that he died in the interval between the visit to the Temple of <a href="/luke/2-42.htm" title="And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.">Luke 2:42</a> and the preaching of the Baptist, and that he was older than Mary. Both were poor; Joseph worked as a carpenter (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>), Mary offered the cheaper sacrifice of "two young pigeons" (<a href="/luke/2-24.htm" title="And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.">Luke 2:24</a>). They had no house at Bethlehem (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>). Mary was related to Elizabeth, the wife of Zechariah the priest (<a href="/luke/1-36.htm" title="And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.">Luke 1:36</a>). Both were within the circle of those who cherished Messianic expectations, and to whom, therefore, the announcement that these expectations were to be fulfilled would come as the answer to their hopes and prayers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-25.</span> - JESUS THE CHRIST BY DIVINE ORIGIN.

The object of this paragraph is to show that Messiah was in origin not of man but of God. This fact was accepted even by his reputed father Joseph, who was only convinced of it after a special communication by an angel in a dream; giving him the facts of the case, and foretelling that a son would be born, and that this Son would be the expected Saviour; and also showing from prophecy that such union of God with man was no unheard-of supposition, but the fulfilment and completion of ancient thought suggested by God. Joseph at once accepts the communication and takes Mary home, avoiding, however, all cause for the supposition that the child was, after all, of human origin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the birth</span> (ver. 1, note). <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("generation") of the received text refers to the causative act, the true reading (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) to the birth itself (cf. <a href="/luke/1-14.htm">Luke 1:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of Jesus Christ was on this wise</span>.

Dr. Hort, in Westcott and Hort, 'Appendix.' Bishop Westcott, however, seems to prefer the reading. "of the Christ," and so distinctly Irenaeus, 3:16). If the reading, "of Christ Jesus," be accepted, the evangelist purposely repeats his phrase of ver. 17, and then identifies him with the historic Person. <span class="cmt_word">When as</span>.

Betrothal was and is with the Semitic races a much more formal matter than with us, and as binding as marriage; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; cf. also the words of the angel, "Mary thy wife" (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">Before they came together</span>; including, probably, both the home-bringing (ver. 24) and the consummation (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_word">She was found</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Although Cureton ('Corp. Ign.,' p. 271) shows that the Aramaic equivalent is used in the sense of "became," and wishes to see this weaker meaning in several passages of the Greek Testament (including, apparently, the present), the references that he gives (<a href="/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-12.htm">2 Corinthians 11:12</a>) do not justify us in giving up the stronger and more usual sense. On <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> always involving more or less prominently the idea of a surprise, cf. Bishop Lightfoot on <a href="/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a>. Observe the reverent silence with which a whole stage of the history is passed over. <span class="cmt_word">With child of the Holy Ghost</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; cf. ver. 20, without the article in both cases). According to the usual interpretation of these words, "the Holy Ghost" refers to the Third Person of the Trinity, and "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) is used because the agent can be regarded as the immediate source (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-2.htm">2 Corinthians 2:2</a>). But the questions suggest themselves: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> whether <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is here used in a strictly Christian or in a pre-Christian sense? and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if the latter, what was this pre-Christian sense? As to (1), it may be argued that the evangelist himself, writing long after Pentecost, and recording sayings taught among Christians only alter Pentecost, would naturally wish his words to be understood in a Christian sense; and hence that <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here has at least that comparatively developed doctrine of the Personality of the Holy Ghost which we find indicated in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-13.htm">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="/john/14.htm">John 14-16</a>. It may, however, be justly replied that the words are in themselves rather a record of the feelings of Joseph and Mary about the Incarnation, and are merely a translation of the phrase <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> (or its Aramaic equivalent, <span class="accented">Ruah Kudsha</span>) , which they themselves used; and that hence its true meaning here must be rather sought in the meaning of the Semitic phrase in pre-Christian times. In other words, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here means neither more nor less than <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> meant on the lips of a godly and instructed Jew before the teaching of Christ, and especially before Pentecost. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What was this pre-Christian sense? What did R<span class="accented">uah-hakodesh</span> mean? To answer this fully would be to compile a treatise on one of the most difficult and disputed points of Old Testament and early Jewish theology. But a cursory comparison of passages in the Old Testament and the pre-Christian writings seems to show that, though there are many places which quite fall in with the Trinitarian view, and which are often marked by strong personification of the Spirit (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10-14</a>; cf. further App. A. in Dr. Sharpe's 'The Tree of Life,' Cambridge, 1889), religious Jews did not understand by <span class="accented">Ruah-hakodesh</span> a permanent and distinct hypostasis in the Deity, but rather the Deity itself in relation to the world as the Source and Maintenance of its life (<a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; cf. Wisd. 1:7 Wisd. 12:1), in contrast to the Deity absolutely and as the object of worship. Pre-Christian thought, that is to say, used the term "Holy Spirit" as designating the One God in a certain relation to the world, not as designating a permanent and real distinction in the Godhead. If this be so, we must understand the phrase here to mean that Christ was conceived of God (not of any Person in the Godhead) in contrast to man. We may, perhaps, even give to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> its fullest meaning of" origin" (cf <a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The phrase as a whole thus only insists that the Child was by origin Divine. It will be noticed that <a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a> is then closely parallel, "the Holy Ghost" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) there apparently connoting an outpouring of life; "the power of the Most High" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), an outpouring of strength. Dorner ('System.,' 3:343; cf. 162, etc.) says that the expression in our text is "the less precise ancient Christian designation of the Divine Essence generally, out of which ( <span class="accented">de quo</span>) Christ has come. To the Holy Spirit in the Trinitarian sense is only to be ascribed, according to the Scriptures, first, the internal preparation of humanity for the Divine Incarnation, and, secondly, after the <span class="accented">Unio</span> the animation of the humanity of Christ by the Divine power issuing from the Logos." The passage in Martensen's 'Dogmatics,' &sect; 139, so well known for its latter part, apparently agrees with this: "He is born not of the will of a man, nor of the will of the flesh; but the holy will of the Creator took the place of the will of man and of the will of the flesh, - that is, the creating Spirit, who was in the beginning, fulfilled the function of the plastic principle. He was born of the Virgin Mary, the chosen woman in the chosen people. It was the task of Israel to provide, not, as has been often said, Christ himself, but the mother of the Lord; to develop the susceptibility for Christ to a point when it might be able to manifest itself as the pro-foundest unity of nature and spirit - a unity which found expression in the pure virgin. In her the pious aspirations of Israel and of mankind, their faith in the promises, are centred; she is the purest point in history and in nature, and she, therefore, becomes the appointed medium for the new creation." Observe that the Greek Creeds (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, Marcellus] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) , by not inserting the article (contrast afterwards <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c2;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) , probably intended only to reproduce St. Matthew's language. The Latin could not fail to be ambiguous (de <span class="accented">Spiritu Sancto</span>) . If, however, we divest ourselves of considerations directly derived from exegesis, and, turning to the theological side, ask which Person of the Blessed Trinity, in fact, prepared Mary for the Incarnation of the Second Person, we must undoubtedly answer that it was the Third Person. For this is his peculiar function, uniting alike the Persons in the Godhead and also the Godhead to creation (cf. Dorner, 'System.,' 1:425,437; 4:159, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This is how</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hout&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thus, so, in this manner.
