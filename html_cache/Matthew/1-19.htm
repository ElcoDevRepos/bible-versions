In Jewish culture, righteousness was closely associated with obedience to the law and a commitment to justice and mercy. Joseph's righteousness is significant because it sets the stage for his compassionate response to Mary's pregnancy. His character aligns with the Old Testament figures like Noah and Abraham, who were also described as righteous. This righteousness is not just legalistic but also reflects a heart aligned with God's will.<p><b>and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly</b><br>Joseph's unwillingness to disgrace Mary publicly demonstrates his compassion and mercy. According to <a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>, a betrothed woman found to be unfaithful could be stoned. However, Joseph chooses a path of mercy, reflecting the heart of God, who desires mercy over sacrifice (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). This decision also prefigures the merciful nature of Jesus' ministry, where He often chose compassion over strict adherence to the law, as seen in His interactions with sinners and outcasts.<p><b>he resolved to divorce her quietly</b><br>In Jewish betrothal customs, a betrothal was as binding as marriage, requiring a formal divorce to dissolve. Joseph's decision to divorce Mary quietly shows his desire to protect her from public shame and potential punishment. This action reflects a deep sense of justice tempered with mercy, aligning with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Joseph's quiet resolve also foreshadows the discreet and humble nature of Jesus' own mission, which often operated outside the public eye and focused on the heart rather than outward appearances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The earthly father of Jesus, described as a "righteous man."

To him, conscious of being of the house of David, and cherishing Messianic hopes, what he heard would seem to come as blighting those hopes. He dared not, as a "righteous" man, take to himself one who seemed thus to have sinned. But love and pity alike hindered him from pressing the law, which made death by stoning the punishment of such a sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-21.htm" title="Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>), or even from publicly breaking off the marriage on the ground of the apparent guilt. There remained the alternative, which the growing frequency of divorce made easy, of availing himself of a "writ of divorcement," which did not necessarily specify the ground of repudiation, except in vague language implying disagreement (<a href="/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3</a>). Thus the matter would be settled quietly without exposure.
