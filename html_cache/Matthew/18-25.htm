In biblical times, debt was a serious issue, often leading to slavery or imprisonment. The inability to pay symbolizes the human condition of sinfulness and the need for divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."<p><b>the master ordered that he be sold</b><br>In ancient Jewish and Roman cultures, selling a debtor into slavery was a common practice to recover losses. This reflects the severity of the consequences of sin and the justice of God. The master represents God, who is just and righteous, yet also merciful. This action underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for redemption, as seen in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament.<p><b>to pay his debt</b><br>Debt in this context is a metaphor for sin. The concept of sin as a debt is prevalent throughout Scripture, notably in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>), where Jesus teaches to pray for the forgiveness of debts. This reflects the idea that sin incurs a moral and spiritual obligation that must be addressed.<p><b>along with his wife and children</b><br>The inclusion of the man's family in the punishment reflects the communal nature of life in biblical times, where the actions of one family member could affect the entire household. This also illustrates the far-reaching consequences of sin, affecting not just the individual but those around them, as seen in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>and everything he owned</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the man's loss, symbolizing the complete forfeiture of one's life and possessions due to sin. It reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to death and loss, as stated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, "For the wages of sin is death."

The verse underscores three truths: we are powerless to clear our own guilt; God&#8217;s justice rightly demands full payment; and without a Redeemer, the cost is total slavery and loss. In the wider parable, the King&#8217;s later forgiveness magnifies grace, but the gravity of verse 25 ensures we never take that grace lightly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">His lord commanded him to be sold.</span>--The framework of the parable was necessarily drawn from human laws, and, except as indicating the sentence of condemnation passed upon the sinner himself, there is no occasion of pressing the details as we unfold the spiritual meaning that lies below the imagery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He had not to pay.</span> He was absolutely bankrupt, and had no means whatever of meeting the deficit. <span class="cmt_word">To be</span> <span class="cmt_word">sold.</span> The Jewish Law ordered such process in the case of an impecunious debtor (see <a href="/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 41</a>; and the concrete case in <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; comp. also <a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-12.htm">Psalm 44:12</a>). But this law was mitigated by the enactment of the jubilee, which in the course of time restored the bondman to liberty. The instance in the parable appertains rather to Oriental depotism than to the proceedings under Mosaic legislation (see ver. 34, which is not in accordance with Jewish practice). The king, by this severity, may have desired to make the defaulter feel the weight of his debt, and to bring him to repentance, as we see that he was ready to accept the submission of the debtor, and to grant him forgiveness (St. Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">Payment to be made.</span> The verb is put impersonally. Of course, the sale of himself, wife, family, possessions, would not produce enough to satisfy the debt; but the command is to the effect that the proceeds should be taken on account of the debt. The parable; must not be pressed in all its details; a false impression is often produced by fixing spiritual or allegorical meaning upon the unimportant accessories, which, in fact, merely give vividness to the offered picture. The sale of wife and children is of this character, though it may be said generally and experimentally that a man's sins react on his family in some sort, lowering position and reputation, and reducing to poverty etc.; but this result has no bearing on the lessening of the original debt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Since</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the man]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
