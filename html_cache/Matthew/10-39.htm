In the context of <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a>, Jesus is instructing His disciples about the cost of discipleship. The term "finds his life" refers to those who seek to preserve their earthly life, prioritizing personal gain, comfort, or security over spiritual commitments. Historically, this reflects the cultural context of first-century Judea, where allegiance to Jesus could result in social ostracism or persecution. The idea of losing one's life echoes the call to self-denial found in other parts of the Gospels, such as <a href="/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a> and <a href="/mark/8-35.htm">Mark 8:35</a>. It challenges believers to consider the eternal consequences of their earthly choices.<p><b>and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it</b><br>Here, "loses his life" signifies a willingness to sacrifice personal ambitions, desires, or even physical life for the sake of Christ. This reflects the early Christian experience, where many faced martyrdom for their faith. The phrase "for My sake" underscores the importance of motivation; it is not mere self-denial but a commitment to Christ that is rewarded. The promise of finding life points to the eternal life offered through Jesus, aligning with the broader biblical theme of resurrection and eternal reward. This concept is echoed in <a href="/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>, where Jesus speaks of hating one's life in this world to keep it for eternal life. Theologically, this reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, where true life is found in surrender to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, providing them with instructions and encouragement as He sends them out to preach the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for the challenges and sacrifices involved in following Christ and spreading His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mission_of_the_twelve.htm">The Mission of the Twelve</a></b><br>This event is part of Jesus sending out the twelve apostles to the lost sheep of Israel, instructing them on how to conduct their ministry and what to expect.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradox_of_life_and_loss.htm">The Paradox of Life and Loss</a></b><br>Jesus presents a profound paradox: true life is found not in self-preservation but in self-sacrifice for His sake.

The point of the maxim lies in the contrast between the two senses.

Thus our passage is a compendium, and <a href="/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a> is either a modification by our Lord of an earlier thought, or, more probably, another "setting" of the utterance in place of something that corresponded to it. <a href="/luke/17-33.htm">Luke 17:33</a>, on the other hand, may be a modification by our Lord, or an insertion made in the process of the composition of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">He that findeth</span>; <span class="accented">found</span> (Revised Version margin); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>: but unnecessarily, the statement is timeless, and the inherent thought of completion is contained also in our present tense. <span class="accented">Findeth</span>; after expenditure of trouble, and so <a href="/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a> with parallel passages, "wish to save," and <a href="/luke/17-33.htm">Luke 17:33</a>, "seek to gain."
