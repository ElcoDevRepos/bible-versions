The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions, while the Sadducees were more aristocratic, often associated with the priestly class, and denied certain doctrines like the resurrection. Despite their theological differences, they united in opposition to Jesus, highlighting the threat He posed to their authority and influence. This collaboration underscores the growing tension between Jesus and the Jewish religious leaders.<p><b>and tested Jesus</b><br>The act of testing Jesus indicates a deliberate attempt to challenge His authority and discredit Him. This was not a genuine inquiry but a strategic move to trap Him. Throughout the Gospels, the religious leaders frequently tested Jesus, often with questions about the Law or His teachings, to find grounds for accusation. This reflects their hardened hearts and unwillingness to accept His messianic claims.<p><b>by asking Him to show them a sign from heaven</b><br>A sign from heaven would be a miraculous event that unmistakably demonstrated divine approval. The request for a heavenly sign suggests skepticism about the miracles Jesus had already performed, which they may have dismissed as earthly or even demonic. In Jewish tradition, signs from heaven were associated with divine intervention, as seen in the stories of Elijah and Moses. This demand for a sign reveals their spiritual blindness and refusal to recognize the signs already given, such as Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His authoritative teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

It is probably explained by St. Mark's version of the warning in <a href="/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a>, where "the leaven of Herod" appears as equivalent to "the leaven of the Sadducees" in St. Matthew's report. The Herodians were the Galilean Sadducees, and the union of the two hostile parties was the continuation of the alliance which had begun after our Lord's protest against the false reverence for the Sabbath, which was common to both the parties (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That he would</span> <span class= "bld">shew them a sign from heaven.</span>--The signs and wonders that had been wrought on earth were not enough for the questioners. There might be collusion, or a power, like that implied in the charge of "casting out devils by Beelzebub," preternatural, but not divine. What they asked was a sign like Samuel's thunder from the clear blue sky (<a href="/1_samuel/12-18.htm" title="So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.">1Samuel 12:18</a>), or Elijah's fire from heaven (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm" title="Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.">1Kings 18:38</a>); or, possibly, following the train of thought suggested by the discourse at Capernaum, now definitely asking, what they hinted then (<a href="/context/john/6-30.htm" title="They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?">John 6:30-31</a>), for bread, not multiplied on earth, but coming straight from heaven. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - <span class="accented">The Pharisees and Sadducees desire a sign.</span> (<a href="/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Pharisees also with</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Saddueees;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> The scribes and Pharisees are often mentioned together as watching or attacking Jesus; but this is the first time that we hear of Pharisees combining with Sadducees for this purpose. The two sects were directly opposed to each other, the traditional belief of the former being antagonistic to the scepticism and materialism of the latter. But both were hostile to Christ, whose teaching, on the one hand interfered with rabbinism, and on the other maintained the existence of the supernatural and the certainty of the resurrection. The Sadducees alone seem to have attacked Christ only on two occasions. They were probably Herodians (comp. <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>), and on this account also disliked by the Pharisees; but they were powerful, and held most of the highest offices in the state, and their alliance was sought or allowed in order more effectually to compromise Jesus. Even theological hatred and political opposition sank into indifference in the face of what was regarded as a common danger. Strauss and his school regard this combination as so unnatural that they throw discredit on the whole account. This is shallow criticism. Nothing is more common than for persons opposed on all other subjects to coalesce for an unholy purpose in which they are jointly interested. The most violent political opponents will join forces in order to gain some desired point, and. when an attack on the Church is meditated, even unbelievers are gladly welcomed. Tertullian says forcibly, "Christ is always being crucified between two thieves." <span class="cmt_word">Tempting</span>. Trying him with captious questions, to bring him into a difficulty, or to give them an opportunity of accusing him of heterodoxy, or disloyalty, or insubordination, and of discrediting him with the people. <span class="cmt_word">A sign from heaven.</span> The rabbis held that demons and. false gods could perform certain miracles on earth, but God alone could give signs from heaven, such as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the manna of Moses' time, the staying of the sun and moon by Joshua, the lightning and thunder that came at Samuel's word, the stroke of death on the captains who tried to arrest Elijah. They had heard of the miraculous meal just before, and saw how deeply the people were moved by it, and they would imply that such a miracle was no proof of a Divine mission, as it might have been wrought by magical or Satanic agency. Let Christ give a sign from heaven, and they would acknowledge his claims. They knew what Christ's answer would be, as they had already attacked him with the same demand (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>); and they hoped that he would either refuse to gratify them, as before, or else make an attempt and fail. In either case they thought they might turn the circumstance to his disadvantage. The Sadducees joined in the request, because they disbelieved in all such occurrences, and were fully persuaded that they were impossible, and any one who attempted to produce them must prove himself a miserable impostor. The word translated desired.
