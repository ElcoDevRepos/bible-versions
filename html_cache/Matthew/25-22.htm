The servant's approach to the master signifies accountability and responsibility. In the cultural context of the time, servants were often entrusted with significant responsibilities, reflecting the trust and authority given by their masters. This servant's actions are a demonstration of faithfulness and diligence, qualities highly valued in biblical teachings.<p><b>&#8216;Master, you entrusted me with two talents.</b><br>The term "master" indicates a relationship of authority and submission, common in the societal structure of ancient times. The "two talents" refer to a large sum of money, as a talent was a significant unit of currency in the ancient world, equivalent to many years' wages for a laborer. This reflects the master's trust in the servant's ability to manage substantial resources. Biblically, this can be seen as a metaphor for the gifts and responsibilities God entrusts to His followers.<p><b>See, I have gained two more.&#8217;</b><br>The servant's report of gaining two more talents demonstrates his successful stewardship and industriousness. This doubling of the talents symbolizes fruitful labor and the multiplication of resources, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of growth and productivity in the Christian life. This outcome aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, which states that faithfulness in small things leads to greater responsibilities. The servant's success can also be seen as a type of Christ's work, where the initial investment (His life and teachings) yields a bountiful return (the growth of the Church and the spread of the Gospel).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>In the Parable of the Talents, the servants represent believers who are entrusted with resources and responsibilities by God.

No one slips through unnoticed (<a href="/luke/19-15.htm">Luke 19:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;received,&#8221; Matthew reminds us that everything starts with grace; the talents were not earned but given (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>&#8226; The servant speaks freely; the relationship is personal, not distant (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Words matter when we face Christ. Jesus taught that &#8220;every careless word&#8221; will be reviewed (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>). Here, the servant&#8217;s words are careful, reverent, and focused on the Master&#8217;s interests.<p>&#8226; Speaking up also models confession of stewardship&#8212;openly acknowledging what has been done with God&#8217;s gifts (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Master, you entrusted me with two talents.</b><p>&#8226; He begins by affirming ownership: &#8220;Master, you entrusted.&#8221; All we possess is on loan from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The specific number&#8212;two talents&#8212;shows God tailors responsibilities. Faithfulness, not size, is the issue (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; By rehearsing the original charge, the servant shows he understood his assignment and kept it in view (<a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See, I have gained two more.&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;See&#8221; invites the Master to inspect the results.

The passage invites every believer to steward God-given resources&#8212;time, abilities, finances, influence&#8212;so that when our moment before Christ arrives, we can likewise say, &#8220;Master, see what Your grace enabled me to gain for You.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That had received</span> [<span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>two talents</span>.
