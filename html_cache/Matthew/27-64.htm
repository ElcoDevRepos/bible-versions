The "third day" is significant in Jewish tradition, often associated with divine intervention and fulfillment of promises (<a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>). The act of securing the tomb reflects the political and religious tension of the time, as the Jewish leaders sought to prevent any claim of resurrection that could incite unrest or challenge their authority.<p><b>Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away</b><br>This phrase indicates the fear of the Jewish leaders that the disciples might attempt to fabricate a resurrection by stealing Jesus' body. It reflects their awareness of Jesus' prediction of His resurrection and their desire to prevent any possibility of such claims. Historically, grave robbery was a concern, and the leaders wanted to ensure that no such incident could be used to support Jesus' messianic claims.<p><b>and tell the people He has risen from the dead.</b><br>The concern about the disciples spreading a resurrection story underscores the leaders' fear of Jesus' influence even after His death. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, as it validates Jesus' divinity and His victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>). The leaders' anxiety about this message spreading shows their understanding of its potential impact on the people and their own authority.<p><b>And this last deception would be worse than the first.&#8221;</b><br>The "first" deception likely refers to Jesus' claim to be the Messiah, which the Jewish leaders rejected. They considered His teachings and miracles as misleading the people. The "last deception," the claim of resurrection, would be more dangerous as it could solidify Jesus' messianic status and inspire a larger following. This reflects the leaders' fear of losing control and the potential for a significant shift in religious and social dynamics.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor who presided over the trial of Jesus and authorized His crucifixion.

They want an official Roman command, not just their own guards, to make the tomb as secure as possible.

Ironically, His enemies take the prophecy more literally than His friends (<a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>). By asking for a guard &#8220;until the third day,&#8221; they unwittingly acknowledge the specific timetable Jesus gave, setting the stage for undeniable proof when the tomb is empty on schedule (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away</b><p>The leaders assume natural explanations:<p>&#8226; The disciples might stage a grave robbery (<a href="/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1&#8211;2</a> shows their initial confusion, not a plot).<p>&#8226; They fear the spread of a resurrection story, yet overlook the disciples&#8217; current fear and hiding (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>).<p>Their concern highlights that Christ&#8217;s followers had no opportunity or motive to fabricate a miracle&#8212;they were discouraged and scattered (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tell the people He has risen from the dead</b><p>They dread a public resurrection claim because:<p>&#8226; Crowds had already hailed Jesus as prophet and king (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>; <a href="/john/12-12.htm">John 12:12&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; A risen Messiah would validate every word He spoke (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24, 32</a>).<p>God allows this fear to push them into actions that end up confirming the resurrection&#8212;the sealed tomb, official guard, and later the soldiers&#8217; testimony (<a href="/matthew/28-11.htm">Matthew 28:11&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And this last deception would be worse than the first.</b><p>&#8220;The first&#8221; deception, in their minds, was Jesus&#8217; claim to be the Christ (<a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>).

This word is absent from the best manuscripts and from the Vulgate. It seems to have been an early interpolation. <span class="cmt_word">And steal him away</span>. A most unlikely hypothesis under the circumstances. The disciples had forsaken Christ while alive, were now hiding in terror, and utterly demoralized and depressed; were they likely to incur further danger for the sake of supporting an assertion, which, unless it proved absolutely true, would only further crush their faith and hope? The rulers seem to have had an uneasy feeling that Jesus might reappear, and they thus prepared themselves to cast discredit upon him, even if, like Lazarus, he rose from the dead. This explanation of the Resurrection has obtained among the Jews from the time of Justin Martyr ('Dial. c. Tryph.,' 17; 108.), and has scarcely yet died out, though in many quarters what is called the "vision<span class="accented">-</span>hypothesis" has taken its place (see on Matthew 28:15, and Edersheim, 2, pp. 626, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The people</span>. The Pharisees were always disdainful of the vulgar herd. "This people who knoweth not the Law are cursed" (<a href="/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The last error...the first.</span> "Error" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as they had called Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 63), so the word here may be taken actively, as meaning "imposture." The deception arising from his death and supposed resurrection would be of graver consequence than that concerned with his previous life. Morison, considering the word to have its usual meaning of "error," regards it as used by the Pharisees in a political sense, in accordance with the governor's standpoint: "If that deceiver's body should be stolen by his disciples, the fickle people will undoubtedly leap back to their old conclusion, that after all he was what he professed to be. This conclusion would be, as we all know, an 'error;' but yet it would be most thin, ions to the interests of Caesar. There would be more political disaffection than ever." It is more simple to say that the first error, the acceptance of Christ's Messianic claims, was not of such decided and far-reaching consequence as would be the belief in his resurrection. They do not, indeed, see all that such belief involves; but they understood enough to know that it would give supernatural importance to all the words and acts of his life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-64.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
