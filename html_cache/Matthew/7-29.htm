Rabbis typically cited previous teachers or traditions to validate their teachings. Jesus, however, spoke with inherent authority, suggesting a direct connection to divine wisdom. This authority is rooted in His identity as the Son of God, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, which speak of a ruler with divine authority. His authoritative teaching is also a type of the ultimate prophet like Moses, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</a>, who would speak God's words directly to the people.<p><b>and not as their scribes</b><br>Scribes in Jesus' time were experts in the Law, often associated with the Pharisees. They were respected for their knowledge but were known for their reliance on tradition and interpretation rather than original insight. The contrast here highlights the difference between Jesus' divine insight and the human tradition-bound teaching of the scribes. This distinction is further emphasized in passages like <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, where Jesus criticizes the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy and legalism. Jesus' teaching, in contrast, is characterized by clarity, truth, and a call to genuine righteousness, as seen throughout the Sermon on the Mount.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is concluding His Sermon on the Mount, demonstrating His divine authority in teaching.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scribes.htm">The Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders and teachers of the Law, known for their detailed knowledge of the Scriptures but lacking the divine authority that Jesus possessed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant teaching event where Jesus delivers profound moral and spiritual lessons, covering Matthew chapters 5 through 7.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience listening to Jesus, who were astonished by His authoritative teaching, contrasting it with the teachings of the scribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, a place of significant ministry activity for Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' authority is inherent and divine, unlike the derived authority of the scribes.

More striking still is the entire absence of any reference by name to the teaching of other interpreters of the Law. As a rule, the scribe hardly ever gave his exposition without at least beginning by what had been said by Hillel or by Shammai, by Rabbi Joseph or Rabbi Meir, depending almost or altogether upon what had thus been ruled before, as much as an English lawyer depends on his precedents. In contrast with all this, our Lord fills the people with amazement by speaking to them as One who has a direct message from God. It is the prophet, or rather, perhaps, the king, who speaks, and not the scribe.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he taught them</span>.
