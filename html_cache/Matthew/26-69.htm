Courtyards in ancient Jerusalem were often open spaces within a building complex, typically surrounded by walls or buildings. This setting highlights Peter's internal conflict between fear and loyalty. The courtyard is part of the high priest's house, indicating Peter's access to the inner circle, possibly due to his association with John, who was known to the high priest (<a href="/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15-16</a>).<p><b>and a servant girl came up to him</b><br>The mention of a servant girl emphasizes the unexpected nature of the challenge to Peter's loyalty. In the cultural context, a servant girl would have been considered low in social status, yet her question initiates Peter's denial. This encounter fulfills Jesus' prophecy of Peter's denial (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>). The presence of a servant girl also underscores the informal and public nature of the courtyard, where various people, including servants, would gather.<p><b>&#8220;You also were with Jesus the Galilean,&#8221; she said</b><br>The identification of Jesus as "the Galilean" reflects the regional distinction and possible prejudice against Galileans, who were often viewed as less sophisticated by the Judean population. This label connects Jesus to His ministry in Galilee, where He performed many miracles and taught extensively. The servant girl's statement is an accusation that associates Peter with Jesus, putting him at risk of arrest or persecution. This moment is pivotal in Peter's journey, as it tests his faith and courage, ultimately leading to his denial, which is a significant event in the Passion narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later for his denial of Jesus during His trial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant_girl.htm">Servant Girl</a></b><br>A young female servant who recognizes Peter as a follower of Jesus, initiating the first of Peter's three denials.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/courtyard.htm">Courtyard</a></b><br>The setting where Peter's denial takes place, likely part of the high priest's residence where Jesus was being tried.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_the_galilean.htm">Jesus the Galilean</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus, emphasizing His origin from Galilee, a region often looked down upon by the Judean elite.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/denial_of_jesus.htm">Denial of Jesus</a></b><br>A significant event where Peter denies knowing Jesus, fulfilling Jesus' earlier prophecy about Peter's denial.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weakness_of_human_resolve.htm">The Weakness of Human Resolve</a></b><br>Despite Peter's earlier declarations of loyalty, he succumbs to fear.

Compare <a href="/mark/14-54.htm">Mark 14:54</a>: &#8220;Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. He was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.&#8221;<p>- The courtyard is a place of decision. Peter is physically nearer to Jesus than most disciples, yet spiritually wavering&#8212;an echo of his earlier walk on the water (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A servant girl came up to him</b><p>- God uses an unexpected instrument: not a soldier, but a household servant (<a href="/luke/22-56.htm">Luke 22:56</a>; <a href="/john/18-17.htm">John 18:17</a>).<p>- Her approach is immediate and direct. Peter&#8217;s bravado had been toward armed opponents (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>), yet a young servant unsettles him.<p>- The scene fulfills Jesus&#8217; warning that Peter would deny Him before the rooster crowed (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>); this is the first step toward that prediction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"You also were with Jesus the Galilean"</b><p>- The charge is specific: association with &#8220;Jesus the Galilean,&#8221; a term the Jerusalem elite used dismissively (<a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>).<p>- &#8220;You also&#8221; points back to the arrest party&#8217;s knowledge that other disciples had fled (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>). Peter is identified as part of that group.<p>- This moment forces a decision: Will Peter confess Christ (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>) or seek self-preservation?<p>- Contrast Peter here with his later Spirit-empowered boldness before similar authorities (<a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8-13</a>).

While Jesus stands unwavering inside, Peter sits vulnerable outside. A seemingly insignificant servant girl becomes God&#8217;s instrument to expose the disciple&#8217;s fear. Her simple statement confronts Peter with his identity&#8212;whether he truly belongs to Jesus the Galilean. The verse sets the stage for Peter&#8217;s denial, reminding readers that no human courage is sufficient apart from the sustaining grace later supplied through the risen Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(69) <span class= "bld">Now Peter sat without in the palace.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">had sat down in the court.</span> The word rendered "palace" here and in <a href="/matthew/26-58.htm" title="But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.">Matthew 26:58</a>, is strictly the court-yard or quadrangle round which a house was built.

St. Matthew groups them all together in one view without special regard to time and place. The fact doubtless is this - that Peter did not distinctly three times, in three separate utterances, deny Christ, but that on three occasions, and under different circumstances, and in many different words, he committed this sin. There are, as it were, three groups of questions and replies, and the evangelists have recorded such portions of these details as seemed good to them, or such as they were best acquainted with. <span class="cmt_word">Peter sat</span> (<span class="accented">was sitting</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>without in the palace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>). We have seen (ver. 48) that Peter was introduced by John into the open court round which the palace was built, and on one side of which was the chamber in which the examination of Jesus was going on. He was within the palace enclosure, but outside the principal apartment; hence he is said in the text to have been without. Admission to the courtyard was gained by a passage through the side of a house, which formed the vestibule or porch; this was closed towards the street by a heavy gate, having in it a small wicket for the use of visitors, kept by a porter or other servant. <span class="cmt_word">A damsel.</span> This was the female porteress who kept the wicket by which Peter was admitted. She appears to have had some suspicion of him from the first, and to have followed him with her remarks from the gate, and to have continued them when he sat down with the servants at the fire kindled in the open court. <span class="cmt_word">Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span> She says, "Thou also" in reference to John, whom she had first admitted, and who seems to have been in no danger, though Peter had great fears for his own safety. Though the porteress probably had no personal knowledge of the apostle, yet scanning his features by the light of the fire, noting his perturbed aspect and his restless actions, and reflecting on his companionship with John, she conjectured that he was a disciple of Christ, and more than once hazarded the assertion with the view of eliciting a definite answer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-69.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Meanwhile,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
