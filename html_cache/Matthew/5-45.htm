In biblical context, being a "son" implies sharing in the nature and character of the Father. This aligns with the Jewish understanding of sonship, where sons were expected to carry on the family traits and values. The concept of God as "Father" is central to Jesus' teachings, highlighting a personal and relational aspect of God, contrasting with the more distant view of God in some Old Testament contexts. This phrase also connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, which speaks of believers being given the right to become children of God, and <a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, which describes those led by the Spirit as sons of God.<p><b>He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good,</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates God's impartiality and common grace. The sun rising is a daily occurrence that benefits all people, regardless of their moral standing. In the historical and cultural context of the time, the sun was essential for agriculture, health, and daily life, making it a powerful symbol of God's provision. This reflects the idea that God's blessings are not limited to the righteous but are extended to all humanity, demonstrating His love and mercy. This concept is echoed in <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>, where Paul speaks of God providing rain and fruitful seasons as a witness to His goodness.<p><b>and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</b><br>Rain, like the sun, was crucial for survival in the agrarian society of ancient Israel. It symbolizes God's provision and sustenance. The geographical context of Israel, with its reliance on seasonal rains for crops, underscores the importance of this blessing. By sending rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous, God shows His fairness and generosity. This challenges the common belief of the time that prosperity was a direct result of personal righteousness. Theologically, this reflects the idea of God's common grace, which is available to all people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>, which declares that the Lord is good to all and has compassion on all He has made.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the Sermon on the Mount, where this verse is located.

Criminals and saints alike begin each morning bathed in the same warmth.<p>&#8226; This daily generosity is part of what theologians call common grace&#8212;God&#8217;s kindness that sustains a fallen world (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>: &#8220;He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By pointing to the sun, Jesus reminds us we are to reflect that same impartial benevolence, shining whether or not the recipient deserves it (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous</b><p>&#8226; In an agrarian society, rain meant life. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a> promises the obedient Israel, &#8220;I will send rain for your land in its season,&#8221; yet here Jesus notes that even the rebellious receive it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a> praises God &#8220;who gives rain upon the earth and sends water upon the fields.&#8221; The Lord does not cancel needed showers because farmers dismiss Him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a> links rain with God&#8217;s purposeful word; both &#8220;accomplish what I please.&#8221; When we bless antagonists, our actions echo that divine purpose, watering dry hearts with tangible love.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a> urges believers to &#8220;be patient&#8230; see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil,&#8221; underscoring that faith-filled kindness, like rainfall, eventually bears fruit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a> teaches that God&#8217;s children mirror their Father&#8217;s indiscriminate kindness. Just as He daily grants sunlight and rain to saints and sinners alike, we are called to extend love beyond our comfort zone. Doing so confirms our identity, showcases God&#8217;s common grace, and becomes a living testimony that the gospel is both true and transformative.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">That ye may be.</span>--Literally, and with far fuller meaning, <span class= "ital">that ye may become.</span> We cannot become like God in power or wisdom. The attempt at that likeness to the Godhead was the cause of man's fall, and leads evermore to a like issue; but we cannot err in striving to be like Him in His love. (Comp. St. Paul's "followers [or, more literally, <span class= "ital">imitators"</span>] of God" in <a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm" title="Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;">Ephesians 5:1</a>.) And the love which we are to reproduce is not primarily that of which the children of the kingdom are the direct objects, showing itself in pardon, and adoption, and spiritual blessings, but the beneficence which is seen in Nature. Our Lord assumes that sunshine, and rain, and fruitful seasons are His Father's gifts, and proofs (whatever may be urged to the contrary) of His loving purpose. Here, again, the teaching of the higher Stoics presents an almost verbal parallel: "If thou wouldst imitate the gods, do good even to the unthankful, for the sun rises even on the wicked, and the seas are open to pirates" (Seneca, <span class= "ital">De Benefic.</span> iv. 2, 6).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>, which is more full, but hardly so original in form. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be the children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); sons (Revised Version); cf. ver. 9, note. The meaning of the clause is not certain.

If we may lay stress on the Greek, our Lord expresses the popular notion of the sun ascending. It must, however, be remembered that the word he himself probably used was <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;</span> in hiph. (, Peshito), which contains no thought of motion, but rather of appearance. <span class="cmt_word">Sun... rain</span>.

Notice how, by chiasm, the emphasis is laid on the ungodly alike at the beginning and at the end. Our Lord here brings out God's active love as seen in nature, nourishing and maintaining men, irrespective of the qualities of individuals and of their treatment of him and his laws. The thought is found elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Seneca (<span class="accented">vide</span> Meyer), "Si deos imitaris, da et ingratis benelicia; ham et sceleratis sol oritur, et piratis patent maria" (cf.
