Pilate's role as governor included maintaining order and administering justice, often involving difficult decisions to appease both Roman authorities and local populations. The choice presented to the crowd reflects a custom during the Passover festival where a prisoner could be released, symbolizing mercy and freedom. This practice is not detailed in Jewish law but is understood as a Roman concession to the Jewish people. The choice between Jesus and Barabbas is significant, as it highlights the stark contrast between the two figures: Jesus, the innocent and righteous one, and Barabbas, a known criminal. This moment underscores the theme of substitutionary atonement, where the innocent suffers in place of the guilty.<p><b>asked the governor.</b><br>Pontius Pilate, as the Roman governor, held significant authority over the region. His involvement in the trial of Jesus is crucial, as it fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being handed over to the Gentiles (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>). Pilate's questioning reflects his attempt to navigate the political tensions between maintaining Roman authority and placating the Jewish leaders and populace. His role in the trial is marked by indecision and attempts to absolve himself of responsibility, as seen in his symbolic washing of hands (<a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Barabbas,&#8221; they replied.</b><br>Barabbas, whose name means "son of the father," is described in the Gospels as a notorious prisoner involved in insurrection and murder (<a href="/mark/15-7.htm">Mark 15:7</a>, <a href="/luke/23-19.htm">Luke 23:19</a>). The crowd's choice of Barabbas over Jesus is a profound moment of irony and tragedy, as they choose a violent revolutionary over the Prince of Peace. This decision reflects the spiritual blindness and rejection of Jesus as the Messiah by the people, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the suffering servant is despised and rejected. The release of Barabbas instead of Jesus serves as a powerful illustration of the gospel message: the guilty are set free while the innocent takes their place, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for the sins of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

Pilate honors that custom here, intentionally narrowing the choice to Jesus or Barabbas.<p>- The scene echoes God&#8217;s pattern of setting choices before people: &#8220;I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p>- Joshua had once challenged Israel, &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). Pilate&#8217;s question likewise forces a public decision about Jesus.<p>- In <a href="/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a> Pilate words the offer this way: &#8220;But it is your custom that I release one prisoner to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release the King of the Jews?&#8221;. By calling Jesus &#8220;King,&#8221; Pilate highlights His innocence and royal claim, sharpening the contrast with Barabbas.<p>- The moment exposes every heart. Jesus, the spotless Lamb (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>), stands beside a proven criminal, and the people must decide which one they truly desire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>asked the governor</b><p>- Civil authority is on display: &#8220;There is no authority except from God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Though Pilate represents Rome, his power is ultimately delegated by God, as Jesus reminds him: &#8220;You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>).<p>- Pilate&#8217;s question sounds neutral, yet it reveals his struggle. Three times he will declare Jesus innocent (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4, 14, 22</a>), but fear of the crowd keeps him from acting on that conviction.<p>- The governor&#8217;s inquiry underscores accountability. Leaders cannot escape responsibility by pushing decisions onto others (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>). Pilate hopes the crowd will free him from moral duty; instead, their answer deepens his dilemma.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Barabbas, they replied</b><p>- All four Gospels concur that the crowd chooses Barabbas (<a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11</a>; <a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a>; <a href="/john/18-40.htm">John 18:40</a>). Mark notes he was &#8220;in prison with the rebels who had committed murder in the uprising&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-7.htm">Mark 15:7</a>).<p>- <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a> recalls the choice: &#8220;You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you&#8221;. The contrast is stark&#8212;light versus darkness, innocence versus violence.<p>- Their selection fulfills prophecy. <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> foretold Messiah would be &#8220;despised and rejected by men.&#8221; The people prefer a violent insurrectionist over the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<p>- Substitution shines through. Barabbas walks free because Jesus takes his place on the cross, a living picture of <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>: &#8220;God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God&#8221;.<p>- The crowd&#8217;s cry exposes the human heart: without the Spirit&#8217;s renewal (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>), we naturally reject God&#8217;s Son and cling to sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-21.htm">Matthew 27:21</a> records a decisive moment where choice, authority, and substitution converge. Pilate offers a clear option between the sinless Son of God and a notorious criminal. The governor&#8217;s question spotlights human responsibility, while the crowd&#8217;s answer reveals mankind&#8217;s fallen preference for darkness over light. Yet God uses even this rejection to advance His redemptive plan: Jesus is condemned so that sinners&#8212;symbolized by Barabbas&#8212;can go free.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Answered</span>, to the various cries which reached him. <span class="cmt_word">Whether of the twain?</span> <span class="accented">Which of the two?</span> He repeats the question before asked (ver. 17), having given the multitude time for deliberation, and offering them no alternative but to choose one of these two prisoners. <span class="cmt_word">Barabbas.</span> They prefer a murderer to the Prince of life - a selection on their part guilty and malevolent, but on the part of God necessary for our salvation (Quesnel). Truly, Jesus "was despised and rejected of men." If he had been released now, his liberation would not have been, as it ought to have been, an act of simple justice, but an imperial concession, an act of grace, in which the character of the prisoner was not regarded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Tina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
