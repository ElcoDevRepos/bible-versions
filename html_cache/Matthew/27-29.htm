This act fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bears the iniquities of humanity.<p><b>and set it on His head.</b><br>Placing the crown on Jesus' head was a deliberate act of humiliation, intended to ridicule His authority. This act parallels the anointing of kings in the Old Testament, but in a perverse manner. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who will wear many crowns as described in <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>.<p><b>They put a staff in His right hand,</b><br>The staff, or reed, symbolizes a scepter, a traditional emblem of royal authority.

The likeness of the crown or garland thus made to that worn by conquering kings and emperors, fitted it admirably for the purpose. The shrub was likely enough to be found in the garden attached to the Praetorium.<p><span class= "bld">A reed in his right hand.</span>--Here also the word is vague, and it may have been the stalk either of a sugar-cane, a <span class= "ital">Papyrus,</span> or an <span class= "ital">Arundo.</span> It represented, of course, the sceptre which, even under the Republic, had been wielded by generals in their triumphs, and which under the Empire, as with Greek and Eastern kings, had become the received symbol of sovereignty.<p><span class= "bld">They bowed the knee before him.</span>--We have to represent to ourselves the whole cohort as joining in the derisive homage. The term in <a href="/mark/15-19.htm" title="And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit on him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.">Mark 15:19</a> implies a continued, not a momentary act--the band filing before the mock-king, and kneeling as they passed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Platted a crown of thorns.</span> In carrying out their mockery, the soldiers next supply a regal crown. Palestine was a country thickly set with brambles and thorn-growing bushes. They would have no difficulty in finding plants to suit their cruel purpose, and in plucking with their gauntlet-covered bands sprays sufficient to weave into a rude coronet. What was the particular shrub employed cannot be known for certainty. The <span class="accented">zizyphus, Spina Christi</span>, a kind of acacia with long reflex thorns, is of too brittle a nature to be used in this way. Some variety of the cactus or prickly pear may be meant. "Hasselquist, a Swedish naturalist, supposes a very common plant, <span class="accented">naba</span> or <span class="accented">nabka</span> of the Arabs, with many small and sharp spines, soft, round, and pliant bushes, leaves much resembling those of ivy, being of a very deep green, as if in designed mockery of a victor's wreath, 'Travels,' 288" (F.M.). Thorns were the fruits of the primal curse, which Christ, the second Adam, was now bearing, and by bearing removed. <span class="cmt_word">A reed in his right hand.</span> By way of sceptre.
