In the cultural context of first-century Judea, marriage was a significant covenant, and sexual relations were expected after the betrothal period. However, Joseph refrained from consummating the marriage until after Jesus' birth, highlighting his respect for God's plan and the miraculous nature of Jesus' conception. This action also fulfills the prophecy of the virgin birth found in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, underscoring the divine nature of Jesus' origin.<p><b>until she gave birth to a Son</b><br>The phrase indicates the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the virgin birth. The birth of a son to a virgin was a sign of the Messiah, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. This event marks a pivotal moment in salvation history, as it introduces Jesus, who is both fully divine and fully human. The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>, aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold the birthplace of the Messiah.<p><b>And he gave Him the name Jesus</b><br>The naming of Jesus by Joseph is significant for several reasons. In Jewish tradition, the father naming the child signifies legal paternity and acceptance into the Davidic line, fulfilling the messianic prophecy that the Messiah would come from the house of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The name "Jesus" is the Greek form of "Yeshua" or "Joshua," meaning "The Lord is salvation." This name reflects His mission to save His people from their sins, as stated in <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>. The act of naming also signifies Joseph's obedience to the angel's command in <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>, demonstrating his faithfulness to God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The earthly father of Jesus, a righteous man who obeyed God's command to take Mary as his wife despite the unusual circumstances of her pregnancy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, a virgin chosen by God to bear His Son, fulfilling the prophecy of the virgin birth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The Son of God, whose birth is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the beginning of the New Covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The prophesied birthplace of Jesus, connecting to the lineage of David and fulfilling <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virgin_birth.htm">The Virgin Birth</a></b><br>A miraculous event prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, emphasizing the divine nature of Jesus' conception and birth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Joseph's obedience to God's command, despite societal norms and personal doubts, serves as a model for us to trust and follow God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>The virgin birth of Jesus is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, encouraging us to trust in His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_names.htm">The Significance of Names</a></b><br>The name "Jesus" means "The Lord saves," reflecting His mission to save humanity from sin.
