The earth being referred to as God's "footstool" is a metaphor that highlights God's sovereignty and majesty. This imagery is rooted in Old Testament scripture, such as <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where God declares, "Heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool." This indicates that the earth is under God's dominion and should not be used lightly in oaths. The cultural context of the time saw the earth as a significant part of God's creation, deserving respect and reverence. This phrase also underscores the idea that all of creation is under God's authority, and thus, invoking it in oaths is inappropriate.<p><b>or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</b><br>Jerusalem holds a central place in biblical history and prophecy. It is often referred to as the "city of the great King," which can be seen as a reference to both King David, who established Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and to God Himself, who is the ultimate King. <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2-3</a> describes Jerusalem as "the city of the great King," highlighting its spiritual and historical significance. In the time of Jesus, Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, making it a focal point of religious life. By referring to Jerusalem in this way, Jesus is reminding His audience of its sacred status and the inappropriateness of using it in oaths. This phrase also points to the messianic expectation of a future King, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>In this verse, the earth is described as God's footstool, emphasizing His sovereignty and the sacredness of creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>Referred to as "the city of the great King," Jerusalem holds significant religious and historical importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_king.htm">The Great King</a></b><br>This title refers to God, highlighting His supreme authority and kingship over all creation, including Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_creation.htm">Reverence for God's Creation</a></b><br>Recognize the earth as God's footstool, which calls for a respectful and responsible stewardship of the environment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Acknowledge God's ultimate authority over all things, including the earth and Jerusalem, which should inspire trust and obedience in His divine plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem's_spiritual_significance.htm">Jerusalem's Spiritual Significance</a></b><br>Appreciate the historical and spiritual importance of Jerusalem as a focal point of God's redemptive history and a symbol of His eternal kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_rash_oaths.htm">Avoiding Rash Oaths</a></b><br>Jesus' teaching discourages swearing by created things, reminding us to let our "yes" be "yes" and our "no" be "no," promoting honesty and integrity in our speech.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_5_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 5:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_35_God_s_rule_over_earth.htm">How does Matthew 5:35 emphasize God's sovereignty over the earth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_earth_is_His_footstool_show_majesty.htm">What does "earth is His footstool" reveal about God's majesty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_35_Isaiah_66_1_God_s_authority.htm">How does Matthew 5:35 connect to Isaiah 66:1 regarding God's authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_ownership_on_choices_2.htm">How can acknowledging God's ownership of earth influence daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_5_35_affect_our_view_of_stuff.htm">In what ways should Matthew 5:35 shape our view of earthly possessions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_earth_God_s_footstool_in_Matt_5_35.htm">Why does Matthew 5:35 emphasize the earth as God's footstool?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_35_and_God_s_sovereignty.htm">How does Matthew 5:35 relate to the concept of God's sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Matthew_5_35_s_imagery.htm">What historical context influenced the imagery in Matthew 5:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_divine_mercy_sunday_important.htm">What does 'earth is God's footstool' signify?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'earth_is_god's_footstool'_mean.htm">What does "earth is God's footstool" signify?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_is_jesus_christ.htm">Who is Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_ecclesiastes_and_matthew_align_on_vows.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5 exhorts swift fulfillment of vows, yet Matthew 5:34-37 warns against making vows--how is this not a contradiction?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 5:35 Mean</div><b>or by the earth, for it is His footstool</b><p>Jesus has just forbidden swearing &#8220;by heaven,&#8221; and now He widens the scope to the planet beneath our feet. When people in His day wanted to sound convincing, they would invoke something grand yet seemingly less sacred than God&#8217;s own name. The earth felt safe for that purpose&#8212;common, visible, tangible. Jesus overturns that idea.<p>&#8211; The earth belongs entirely to God; it is &#8220;His footstool&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>; <a href="/acts/7-49.htm">Acts 7:49</a>). We cannot treat it as a neutral object detached from Him.<p>&#8211; Swearing by the earth is, in effect, swearing by the sovereign Owner of the earth. That strips away any supposed loophole.<p>&#8211; The image of a footstool speaks of absolute authority. If the Lord places His feet on the earth, where does that leave any human claim of independence? (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8211; By reminding listeners of God&#8217;s ownership, Jesus presses home that any oath made on earthly things still obligates the speaker before the Lord who hears every word (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King</b><p>Next Jesus addresses an oath formula tied to Jerusalem, the spiritual and national heartbeat of Israel. The city&#8217;s sacred aura tempted people to use it as collateral for their promises&#8212;yet again, while trying to avoid direct mention of God.<p>&#8211; Jerusalem carries God&#8217;s name and presence. <a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a> calls it &#8220;the city of our God&#8221; and &#8220;the city of the great King.&#8221; To invoke Jerusalem is, therefore, to invoke God&#8217;s throne-city.<p>&#8211; The &#8220;great King&#8221; is ultimately the Lord Himself (<a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). Even earthly kings who ruled from Jerusalem did so only under His authority (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>).<p>&#8211; If someone swears &#8220;by Jerusalem,&#8221; he draws God into the agreement whether he intends to or not. There is no lesser, safer category when the place chosen is God&#8217;s own dwelling (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus exposes the heart issue: honesty must flow from integrity, not from manipulating religious language (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>; <a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>By forbidding oaths &#8220;by the earth&#8221; and &#8220;by Jerusalem,&#8221; Jesus shows that every corner of creation and every sacred place fall under God&#8217;s absolute rule. No clever wording can separate an oath from the One who hears it. The only fitting response is simple, truthful speech that reflects a heart surrendered to the great King who owns the earth and reigns from Zion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor by Jerusalem</span>.
