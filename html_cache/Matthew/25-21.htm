The response of the master indicates a personal relationship and accountability. This reflects the biblical principle that God communicates with His people and holds them accountable for their stewardship (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Well done, good and faithful servant!</b><br>The commendation "well done" signifies approval and satisfaction with the servant's performance. The terms "good" and "faithful" highlight the moral and reliable character expected of believers. This echoes the biblical call to live righteously and faithfully (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>). The servant's faithfulness is a model for Christian discipleship, emphasizing integrity and perseverance.<p><b>You have been faithful with a few things;</b><br>The phrase underscores the importance of faithfulness in small matters, which is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). It suggests that God values how we manage the resources and opportunities He provides, regardless of their size. This principle is evident in the lives of biblical figures like David, who was faithful as a shepherd before becoming king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>).<p><b>I will put you in charge of many things.</b><br>This promise of greater responsibility reflects the biblical principle of reward for faithfulness. It suggests a future role in God's kingdom, aligning with teachings about believers reigning with Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>). The concept of stewardship extends into eternity, where faithful service on earth leads to greater roles in the heavenly realm.<p><b>Enter into the joy of your master!&#8217;</b><br>The invitation to enter the master's joy signifies the ultimate reward of eternal fellowship with God. This joy is a common biblical theme, representing the fulfillment and happiness found in God's presence (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). It also points to the eschatological hope of believers, where faithfulness leads to eternal life and joy in the presence of the Lord (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with responsibilities and rewards them based on their faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers who are entrusted with God's gifts and are expected to use them wisely and faithfully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_talents.htm">The Talents</a></b><br>In the broader context of the parable, these are the resources or opportunities given by God to His people to steward.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_the_master.htm">The Joy of the Master</a></b><br>Represents the eternal reward and fellowship with God that faithful believers will experience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_of_the_talents.htm">The Parable of the Talents</a></b><br>A teaching of Jesus that illustrates the importance of faithfulness and stewardship in the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>God values our faithfulness in the small tasks and responsibilities He gives us.

Nothing escapes His notice, and His judgment is final and authoritative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Well done, good and faithful servant!</b><p>&#8226; The commendation is personal (&#8220;Well done&#8221;), moral (&#8220;good&#8221;), and consistent (&#8220;faithful&#8221;). This is the praise every believer longs to hear (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Good&#8221; emphasizes character that reflects God&#8217;s own goodness, while &#8220;faithful&#8221; highlights steady obedience over time. Both attributes are required, not optional.<p>&#8226; The affirmation shows that God values faithfulness over apparent success; motive and consistency matter more than magnitude of results.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have been faithful with a few things;</b><p>&#8226; Earthly stewardship, though it may seem small, is God&#8217;s training ground (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Few things&#8221; reminds us that everything we manage here&#8212;time, gifts, relationships, resources&#8212;is limited and temporary, yet eternally significant when handled faithfully.<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s obedience in ordinary tasks reveals trustworthiness, proving readiness for greater responsibilities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will put you in charge of many things.</b><p>&#8226; Future reward involves expanded service, not idleness (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42&#8211;44</a>). God&#8217;s kingdom work continues, and faithful servants share in it.<p>&#8226; This promotion includes authority and partnership with Christ: &#8220;To the one who overcomes, I will grant the right to sit with Me on My throne&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Eternal assignments will perfectly match each believer&#8217;s proven faithfulness, showcasing God&#8217;s justice and generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Enter into the joy of your master!</b><p>&#8226; The greatest reward is relational&#8212;sharing the Master&#8217;s own joy (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Joy here is not merely an emotion but the full experience of unhindered fellowship, satisfaction, and celebration in God&#8217;s presence.<p>&#8226; Entrance implies permanence; once welcomed, the servant remains forever in that joy, free from sorrow, toil, and separation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a> assures believers that every act of faithfulness, no matter how small, is noticed and will be rewarded by Christ Himself. The verse moves from commendation (&#8220;Well done&#8221;) to confirmation of proven character (&#8220;good and faithful&#8221;), then from past stewardship (&#8220;few things&#8221;) to future promotion (&#8220;many things&#8221;), and culminates in the ultimate blessing&#8212;eternal joy with the Master. Live faithfully now, confident that the Lord will honor His word and welcome His servants into everlasting rejoicing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">I will make thee ruler over many things.</span>--Better, I <span class= "ital">will set thee over many things.</span> The word "ruler" is not in the Greek. Here again, as in <a href="/matthew/24-47.htm" title="Truly I say to you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.">Matthew 24:47</a>, we have a glimpse given us into the future that lies behind the veil. So far as the parable brings before us prominently either the final judgment or that which follows upon each man's death, we see that the reward of faithful work lies not in rest only, bat in enlarged activity. The world to come is thus connected by a law of continuity with that in which we live; and those who have so used their "talents" as to turn many to righteousness, may find new spheres of action, beyond all our dreams, in that world in which the ties of brotherhood that have been formed on earth are not extinguished, but, so we may reverently believe, multiplied and strengthened.<p><span class= "bld">Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>--The words are almost too strong for the framework of the parable. A human master would hardly use such language to his slaves. But here, as yet more in the parable that follows, the reality breaks through the symbol, and we hear the voice of the divine Master speaking to His servants, and He bids them share His joy, for that joy also had its source (as He told them but a few hours later) in loyal and faithful service, in having "kept His Father's commandments" (<a href="/context/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10-11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Well done</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">good and faithful servant.</span> He is praised, not for success, but for being "good," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> kind and merciful and honest in exercising the trust for others' benefit; and "faithful," true to his master's interests, not idle or inactive, but keeping one object always before him, steadily aiming at fidelity. Some regard the words as a commendation of the servant's works and faith, but this is not the primary meaning according to the context. <span class="cmt_word">Over a few things.</span> The sum entrusted to him was considerable in itself, but little compared with the riches of his lord, and little in comparison of the reward bestowed upon him. The Greek here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>, the accusative case denoting "extending over," or "as regards." <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">make thee ruler</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">I will set thee</span>, <a href="/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>) <span class="cmt_word">over many things;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the genitive implying fixed authority over. From being a slave he is raised to the position of master. He is treated according to the principle in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much." The spiritual import of this reward is hard to understand, if it is wished to assign to it a definite meaning. It seems to intimate that in the other world Christ's most honoured and faithful followers will have some special work to do for him in guiding and ruling the Church (see on Matthew 19:28; and comp. <a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> Here is seen a marked contrast between the hard life of the slave and the happiness of the master. Literalists find here only a suggestion that the lord invites the servant to attend the feast by which his return home was celebrated. Certainly, the word translated "joy" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) may possibly be rendered "feast," as the LXX. translate <span class="accented">mishteh</span> in <a href="/esther/9-17.htm">Esther 9:17</a>, and a slave's elevation to his master's table would imply or involve his manumission. On the earthly side of the transaction, this and his extended and more dignified office would be sufficient reward for his fidelity. The spiritual signification of the sentence has been variously interpreted. Some find in it only an explanation of the former part of the award, "I will make thee ruler over many things," conveying no further accession of beatitude. But surely this is an inadequate conception of the guerdon. There are plainly two parts to this. One is advancement to more important position; the second is participation in the fulness of joy which the Lord's presence ensures (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>), which, possessed entirely by himself, he communicates to his faithful. This comprises all blessedness. And it is noted that the joy is not said to enter into us. That indeed, though a blessing unspeakable, would be an inferior boon, as Augustine says; but we enter into the joy, when it is not measured by our capacity for receiving it, but absorbs us, envelops us, becomes our atmosphere, our life. Commentators quote Leighton's beautiful remark, "It is but little that we can receive here, some drops of joy that enter into us; but there we shall enter into joy, as vessels put into a sea of happiness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
