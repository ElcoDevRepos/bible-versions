The perfume, identified as pure nard in other Gospel accounts, was a costly ointment imported from the Himalayan region, indicating its high value. The disciples' reaction reflects a practical concern for financial stewardship, as the perfume's worth was approximately a year's wages for a laborer. This highlights the tension between material value and spiritual significance, a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings.<p><b>and the money given to the poor.</b><br>The suggestion to sell the perfume and give the proceeds to the poor aligns with Jewish customs and the teachings of the Torah, which emphasize care for the needy. Almsgiving was a significant aspect of Jewish piety, especially during Passover, when this event takes place. The disciples' proposal reflects a genuine concern for social justice, yet it also reveals a misunderstanding of the moment's spiritual importance. Jesus frequently taught about the importance of helping the poor (e.g., <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>), but here He emphasizes the unique opportunity to honor Him before His impending crucifixion. This moment foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice Jesus would make, offering Himself for the spiritual poverty of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the passage, whose actions and teachings are the focus of the account.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who express concern over the use of expensive perfume.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman_with_the_alabaster_jar.htm">Woman with the Alabaster Jar</a></b><br>- An unnamed woman who anoints Jesus with expensive perfume, demonstrating her devotion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>- The village where this event takes place, near Jerusalem, often associated with Jesus' friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>- Represents those in need, whom the disciples suggest could benefit from the sale of the perfume.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_worship.htm">Value of Worship</a></b><br>The woman's act of anointing Jesus with expensive perfume demonstrates the importance of sacrificial worship.

Scripture often connects fragrant oil with honor and consecration (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-30</a>; Song of Songs 1:12). By breaking the jar, the woman offers unreserved worship, declaring Jesus worthy of a king&#8217;s anointing (<a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>). The fragrance &#8220;filled the house&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>), just as heartfelt devotion fills every corner of a life surrendered to Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>could have been sold</b><p>The disciples&#8217; protest reveals a mindset fixed on calculating value rather than recognizing majesty. John identifies Judas as the loudest voice, noting his ulterior motive: &#8220;He was a thief&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4-6</a>). Like Martha distracted by many tasks (<a href="/luke/10-40.htm">Luke 10:40-42</a>), they miss the moment of worship in favor of practicality. It is possible to speak the language of charity while harboring a heart far from the Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at a high price</b><p>Mark specifies the perfume was worth &#8220;over three hundred denarii&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a>)&#8212;nearly a year&#8217;s wages. Scripture esteems costly worship: David refused offerings &#8220;that cost me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-24.htm">1 Chronicles 21:24</a>), and the widow&#8217;s two small coins outweighed larger gifts because they represented everything she had (<a href="/mark/12-43.htm">Mark 12:43-44</a>). True love for Christ never bargains for the cheapest way to honor Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the money given</b><p>Caring for others is a biblical priority (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>; <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>). Yet giving that bypasses devotion to Jesus becomes hollow. Paul links generosity to love for the Lord, urging believers to give &#8220;not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). When worship is first, stewardship follows in its proper place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the poor</b><p>Jesus champions the needy (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>; <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a>), but He also states, &#8220;The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-11.htm">Matthew 26:11</a>). In this unique moment&#8212;days before the cross&#8212;the anointing prepares His body for burial (<a href="/matthew/26-12.htm">Matthew 26:12</a>). Devotion to Christ fuels, rather than competes with, compassion for the poor; the order matters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/26-9.htm">Matthew 26:9</a> records a sincere-sounding objection that masks misplaced priorities. By spotlighting the perfume&#8217;s price, the disciples undervalue the presence of the Priceless One before them. The passage reminds us that:<p>&#8226; Worship that costs nothing is worth nothing.<p>&#8226; Practical service must flow from wholehearted adoration of Jesus.<p>&#8226; Genuine love for Christ naturally overflows to the poor, but it never substitutes for personal devotion.<p>Honoring the Lord first puts every other good deed in its rightful, God-glorifying place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">This ointment might have been sold for much.</span>--St. Mark and St. John agree in giving the Traitor's computation.

St. John adds the damning fact that the pretended zeal for the poor was the cloak for the irritation of disappointed greed. "He was a thief, and bare the bag." He was, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the treasurer or bursar of the travelling company, received the offerings of the wealthier disciples, and disbursed them either on their necessary expenditure or in alms to the poor (see Notes on <a href="/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>; <a href="/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>). This was the "one talent" given to him "according to his ability," and in dealing with it he proved fraudulent and faithless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Might have been sold for much.</span> According to St. John, Judas had accurately estimated the value of the ointment at 300 denarii, equal to about &pound;9 of our money. When we remember that one denarius represented the daily wages of a labouring man (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>), we see that the cost was very large. <span class="cmt_word">Given to the poor.</span> And this "much" given to the poor. But piety is not shown only in giving alms; the honour of God has a superior claim. And Mary was rich, and quite able to afford this offering without neglecting her almsgiving. "How often does charity serve as a cloak for covetousness! We must not neglect what we owe to Jesus Christ under pretence of what we owe his members. Men count as wasted what is expended in the outer worship of God, when they love neither God nor his worship. Jesus Christ authorizes it by accepting it at the very instant in which he was establishing religion by a worship the most spiritual and inward" (Quesnel). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This [perfume]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">could</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(edynato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1410.htm">Strong's 1410: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I am powerful, have (the) power, (b) I am able, I can.
