Jerusalem is the religious and political center of Israel, symbolizing the heart of the Jewish nation. It is a city with a rich history, being the site of the Temple and the place where God chose to dwell among His people. The repetition also reflects a pattern seen in Hebrew literature, where repetition signifies importance and urgency.<p><b>who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her</b><br>This phrase highlights the historical pattern of Jerusalem's rejection of God's messengers. Prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah faced persecution, and others, such as Zechariah, were killed. Stoning was a common method of execution for blasphemy or false prophecy, indicating the severity of the rejection. This pattern of behavior underscores the city's resistance to divine correction and guidance.<p><b>how often I have longed to gather your children together</b><br>Jesus expresses His desire to protect and nurture the people of Jerusalem, akin to God's repeated attempts to call Israel back to faithfulness throughout history. This longing reflects God's covenantal love and patience, as seen in the Old Testament, where God frequently sent prophets to guide and warn His people.<p><b>as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings</b><br>This metaphor illustrates Jesus' protective and caring nature. The imagery of a hen gathering her chicks is a common biblical metaphor for God's protection (e.g., <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>). It conveys warmth, safety, and the desire to shield from harm, emphasizing Jesus' compassionate heart towards Jerusalem despite its rebellion.<p><b>but you were unwilling!</b><br>The unwillingness of Jerusalem to accept Jesus' offer of protection and salvation highlights the theme of human free will and responsibility. Despite God's persistent outreach, the people chose to reject Him, leading to consequences foretold by the prophets. This rejection is a pivotal moment in the narrative, foreshadowing the impending judgment and destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city is central to Jewish identity and worship, often representing the heart of the Jewish nation.

It has been remarked that, whereas St. Matthew elsewhere names the capital city, the theocratic centre, Hierosolyma, which is the Greek equivalent, he here calls it Hierousalem, which is Hebrew, as though, while recording the words used by Jesus, he desired to reproduce the actual sound of the Saviour's affecting address. <span class="cmt_word">Killest...stonest.</span> Such is thy wont, thy evil practice.
