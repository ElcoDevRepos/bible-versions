In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus often contrasts the traditional interpretations of the Law with His deeper, authoritative teaching. This approach highlights His role as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Whoever divorces his wife</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judaism, divorce was a significant issue. The Mosaic Law, specifically <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, allowed for divorce, but interpretations varied. The Pharisees and other religious leaders often debated the grounds for divorce, with some schools of thought, like that of Rabbi Hillel, allowing it for almost any reason, while others, like Rabbi Shammai, were more restrictive.<p><b>must give her a certificate of divorce.&#8217;</b><br>The certificate of divorce, or "get" in Hebrew, was a legal document that formally ended a marriage and allowed the woman to remarry. This requirement was intended to protect the rights of the woman, ensuring she was not left in a state of limbo. In the broader biblical context, Jesus later clarifies His teaching on divorce in <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>, emphasizing the sanctity and permanence of marriage as instituted by God in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>.

Christ calls His followers to higher righteousness&#8212;faithful love reflecting God&#8217;s own covenant loyalty (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/5-31.htm">Matthew 5:31</a> shows Jesus confronting a culture that treated divorce lightly. By quoting the partial Mosaic allowance, He exposes hearts looking for exits instead of honoring covenant. God&#8217;s original plan remains one lifelong, faithful union; any concession was due to human sinfulness, not divine preference. Christ redirects His disciples from legal minimalism to wholehearted commitment, urging marriages that mirror His steadfast love and truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">It hath been said.</span>--The better MSS. give, "<span class= "ital">But</span> it was said," as though stating an implied objection to the previous teaching. Men might think that they could avoid the sin of adultery by taking the easy course of divorcing one wife before marrying another.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall put away . . .</span>--The quotation is given as the popular Rabbinic explanation of <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, which, as our Lord teaches in <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm" title="He said to them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.">Matthew 19:8</a>, was given, on account of the hardness of men's hearts, to prevent yet greater evils. The words of the precept were vague--"If she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her," and the two school of casuists took opposite views of its meaning. The stricter party of Shammai held that the "uncleanness" meant simply unchastity before or after marriage. The followers of Hillel held, on the other hand (as Milton among Christian teachers), that anything that made the company of the wife distasteful was a sufficient ground for repudiation. Even a moralist generally so pure and noble as the son of Sirach, took in this matter the laxer view--"If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-26.htm" title="If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.">Ecclesiasticus 25:26</a>). It is noteworthy that our Lord, whose teaching, especially as regards the Sabbath question, might have been, for the most part, claimed by the school of Hillel, on this matter of divorce stamps the impress of His approval on the teaching of his rival.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="accented">Divorce.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - Here only. <span class="cmt_word">It hath been said</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>).
