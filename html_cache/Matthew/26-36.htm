This location is significant as it was a place Jesus frequented with His disciples (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>), providing a familiar setting for this pivotal moment. The Mount of Olives holds prophetic significance, as it is mentioned in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> as the place where the Lord will stand in the end times. The garden setting evokes imagery of the first garden, Eden, where the first Adam fell, contrasting with Jesus, the last Adam, who would remain obedient to the Father&#8217;s will.<p><b>and He told them, &#8220;Sit here while I go over there and pray.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus instructs His disciples to sit, indicating a separation between His personal struggle and their role as witnesses. This moment underscores the humanity of Jesus, who seeks solitude in prayer during a time of deep distress. Prayer is a central theme in Jesus' ministry, reflecting His dependence on the Father (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). The act of going "over there" signifies a deliberate choice to engage in intimate communication with God, highlighting the importance of prayer in facing trials. This scene foreshadows the disciples' later failure to stay awake and pray, emphasizing the need for spiritual vigilance (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing for His impending crucifixion.

Jesus retired thither for privacy and for prayer in anticipation of what was coming. St. John explains, "Where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples." This so called garden was situated a short distance from the bridge over the Kedron, at the foot of the Mount of Olives. It was a plantation of olives; and there are many of these trees, some of great age, still growing in the neighbourhood. The fanciful idea that some of these witnessed the agony of our Lord has no support whatever. In the first place, olive trees do not live two thousand years; and, secondly, it is certain that in the sieges of Jerusalem all surrounding trees were ruthlessly destroyed; and lastly, the exact site of this terrible scene is unknown, though tradition has fixed upon a certain spot now enclosed with walls, and containing a building known by the name of "The Chapel of the Sweat." <span class="cmt_word">The disciples.</span> Eight of them - Judas having long ago departed - and three Jesus took with him deeper into the dim recesses of the wood. <span class="cmt_word">Sit ye here.</span> Remain here, at the entrance to the olive yard. These might not behold even the beginning of his desolation. Their present faith and love were not equal to the strain. <span class="cmt_word">Go and pray yonder.</span> One is reminded of Abraham at Mount Moriah, when he says to the attendants, "Abide ye here, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you" (<a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>). When the Lord says "here" and "yonder," he points to the spots indicated. He always retired to pray, even as he tells his followers to enter into their closets when they put up their supplications to their Father in heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At that time</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
