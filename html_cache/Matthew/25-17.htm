The "two talents" represent a significant sum of money, indicating the master's trust in the servant's abilities. In the cultural context of the time, a talent was a large unit of currency, often equated to about 20 years of a laborer's wages. This servant, like the one with five talents, is entrusted with a portion of the master's wealth, symbolizing the gifts and responsibilities God gives to His people. The use of "likewise" suggests a parallel action to the servant with five talents, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness regardless of the amount entrusted.<p><b>gained two more.</b><br>The servant's action of gaining two more talents demonstrates his diligence and faithfulness in using what was entrusted to him. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where believers are called to wisely manage and multiply the resources God provides. The doubling of the talents signifies fruitful labor and aligns with the biblical theme of bearing fruit, as seen in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him to bear much fruit. This outcome also highlights the reward for faithful service, a recurring theme in Scripture, where God honors those who are faithful with what they have been given, as seen in <a

href="/matthew/25-17.htm">Matthew 25:17</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Likewise&#8221; links this servant&#8217;s outcome to the first servant&#8217;s in verse 16, teaching that faithful stewardship produces comparable results regardless of the initial amount entrusted (cf. <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The word sets up a pattern: each servant is expected to respond in the same spirit of obedience (cf. <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>; <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently affirms that God rewards faithfulness, not merely prominence (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the one with the two talents</b><p>&#8226; This servant received less than the first (two vs. five), yet the Master&#8217;s expectation remains the same&#8212;productive use (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; The distribution underscores God&#8217;s sovereign wisdom: He assigns gifts &#8220;according to each one&#8217;s ability&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-15.htm">Matthew 25:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The smaller sum reminds believers that no gift is insignificant; all are accountable (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gained</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Gained&#8221; shows deliberate effort and initiative, not passive custodianship (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant embraces risk in order to honor the Master, illustrating that faith expresses itself through action (cf. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Fruitful labor is evidence of genuine loyalty (<a

fruitfulness&#8212;precisely what the Master desired (cf. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The result proves that divine resources, when used in obedience, multiply beyond their original measure (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The outcome matches the reward of the first servant (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>), affirming that God measures success by faithfulness, not starting quantity (compare <a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-17.htm">Matthew 25:17</a> shows that even a servant with modest resources can&#8212;and must&#8212;produce abundant results when he diligently employs what the Master has entrusted. The verse stresses equal responsibility, active obedience, and the certainty that faithful stewardship yields multiplied blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise</span>, etc. The second servant made an equally good use of his smaller capital. It matters not whether our endowments are large or little, we have to use them all in the Lord's service. "To whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required" (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>); and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, to whomsoever less is committed, of him less shall be required. The burden is proportioned to the shoulder. We continually observe what to us seem anomalies in the distribution of gifts, but faith sees the hand of God dividing to each severally as he will, and we are confident that God will take account at last not only of the man's ability, but also of his opportunities of exercising the same. "He also" is omitted by Tischendorf, Westcott and Herr, and others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Likewise,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#963;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;saut&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5615.htm">Strong's 5615: </a> </span><span class="str2">In like manner, likewise, just so.
