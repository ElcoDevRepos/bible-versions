This imagery aligns with the prophetic vision in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" is given authority and sovereign power. The title "King" emphasizes His divine authority and role in the final judgment, a theme consistent throughout the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>, where Jesus is called "King of Kings."<p><b>&#8216;Truly I tell you</b><br>This phrase is a solemn declaration used by Jesus to emphasize the truth and importance of His words. It is a common expression in the Gospels, often introducing significant teachings or revelations. The use of "truly" (Greek: "amen") underscores the certainty and reliability of what follows, reflecting Jesus' authority as a teacher and prophet.<p><b>whatever you did not do for one of the least of these</b><br>"The least of these" refers to those who are marginalized, vulnerable, or in need. This phrase highlights the biblical principle of caring for the poor and oppressed, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> and <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>. The cultural context of the time placed a strong emphasis on hospitality and charity, especially towards those who could not repay. This teaching challenges believers to see Christ in every person, particularly those who are overlooked by society.<p><b>you did not do for Me.&#8217;</b><br>This statement identifies Jesus with the needy and suffering, illustrating the profound connection between acts of service to others and service to Christ Himself. It echoes the teaching found in <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>, which equates honoring the poor with honoring God. This identification with the "least" is a type of Christ's own humility and incarnation, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Jesus took on the form of a servant. The passage calls believers to a life of active compassion, reflecting the love and mercy of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is delivering a parable about the final judgment, emphasizing the importance of serving others as a reflection of serving Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_least_of_these.htm">The Least of These</a></b><br>Refers to those in need, such as the hungry, thirsty, strangers, naked, sick, and imprisoned.
