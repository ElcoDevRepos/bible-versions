In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is addressing His disciples and the crowds, urging them to pay attention to His words. The phrase "these words of Mine" highlights the authority of Jesus as the Son of God, whose teachings are foundational for life. In biblical context, hearing implies not just auditory reception but understanding and internalizing the message. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to hear and obey God's commandments.<p><b>and acts on them</b><br>Hearing alone is insufficient; action is required. This reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The call to action is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings, where obedience is a demonstration of genuine faith. The cultural context of the time valued wisdom and understanding, which were seen as incomplete without corresponding actions. This phrase challenges believers to live out their faith through obedience to Christ's teachings.<p><b>is like a wise man</b><br>The comparison to a wise man draws from the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, where wisdom is portrayed as the ability to live righteously and make sound decisions. In the biblical context, wisdom is not merely intellectual but practical, involving the application of knowledge in daily life. The wise man is contrasted with the foolish man later in the passage, highlighting the importance of discernment and prudence.<p><b>who built his house on the rock</b><br>Building on the rock symbolizes a strong, stable foundation. Geographically, the imagery of building on rock would resonate with Jesus' audience, familiar with the rocky terrain of the region. In a spiritual sense, the rock represents Christ Himself and His teachings, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where Christ is referred to as the spiritual rock. This metaphor underscores the necessity of a solid foundation in Christ for enduring life's challenges. The imagery also connects to Old Testament references to God as a rock, a symbol of strength and refuge (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, teaching about the importance of putting His words into practice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_man.htm">The Wise Man</a></b><br>Represents those who hear and act on Jesus' teachings, building their lives on a solid foundation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Symbolizes one's life or spiritual state, which can withstand trials if built on the right foundation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock.htm">The Rock</a></b><br>Represents the teachings and person of Jesus Christ, a stable and unchanging foundation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is given, encompassing Matthew chapters 5-7, where Jesus outlines the principles of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hearing_and_doing.htm">Hearing and Doing</a></b><br>It is not enough to merely hear Jesus' words; true wisdom is demonstrated through action and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foundation_matters.htm">Foundation Matters</a></b><br>The foundation of our lives determines our ability to withstand life's challenges.

On the assumption that the Sermon on the Plain was different from that on the Mount, the recurrence of the same image there makes it probable that this or some similar parable was not an uncommon close to our Lord's discourses.<p><span class= "bld">I will liken him unto a wise man.</span>--The surrounding scenery may, in this as in other instances, have suggested the illustration. As in all hilly countries, the streams of Galilee rush down the torrent-beds during the winter and early spring, sweep all before them, overflow their banks, and leave beds of alluvial deposit on either side. When summer comes their waters fail (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm" title="Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you be altogether to me as a liar, and as waters that fail?">Jeremiah 15:18</a>; <a href="/job/6-15.htm" title="My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;">Job 6:15</a>), and what had seemed a goodly river is then a tract covered with debris of stones and sand. A stranger coming to build might be attracted by the ready-prepared level surface of the sand. It would be easier to build there instead of working upon the hard and rugged rock. But the people of the land would know and mock the folly of such a builder, and he would pass (our Lord's words may possibly refer to something that had actually occurred) into a by-word of reproach. On such a house the winter torrent had swept down in its fury, and the storms had raged, and then the fair fabric, on which time and money had been expended, had given way, and fallen into a heap of ruins. Interpreting the parable in the connection in which our Lord has placed it, it is clear that the house is the general fabric of an outwardly religious life. "The rock" can be nothing else than the firm foundation of repentance and obedience, the assent of the will and affections as well as of the lips. The "sand" answers to the shifting, uncertain feelings which are with some men (the "foolish" ones of the parable) the only ground on which they act--love of praise, respect for custom, and the like. The "wind," the "rain," the "floods" hardly admit, unless by an unreal minuteness, of individual interpretation, but represent collectively the violence of persecution, of suffering, of temptations from without, beneath which all but the life which rests on the true foundation necessarily gives way.<p>Such is obviously the primary meaning of the parable here, but, like most other parables, it has other meanings, which, though secondary, are yet suggestive and instructive, and are not unsanctioned by the analogy of our Lord's teaching. (1.) Already He had bestowed upon one of His disciples the name of Cephas, Peter, the Rock, and in so doing had at least indicated the type of character represented by the "rock" upon which the wise man built. When He afterwards said, "Upon this rock will I build my Church," He was speaking in the character of a wise Master-builder who saw in fervent faith and unhesitating obedience the ground-work on which the Christian society, which He designated as His kingdom, was to rest. (2.) Personal experience and the teaching of the Spirit led men to the thought that there must be a yet deeper foundation, a rock below the rock even of obedience and holiness; and they found in Christ Himself that Rock and that Foundation (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-11</a>). Only in personal union with Him could they find the stability of will without which even their firmest purposes would be as the shifting sand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47-49</a> (cf. also <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10-16</a>). A solemn close to the sermon. By the similitude of two builders our Lord warns his followers that to have heard his words will have been useless unless they put them into practice. Observe that although the word "<span class="accented">hear</span> in these verses cannot indicate that full "<span class="accented">hearing"</span> which it sometimes connotes (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>), yet it seems to mean more than merely listening, and to imply both a grasp of what is intended by the statements made and at least some acquiescence in their truth (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). According to the above explanation, it will be seen that in the imagery the rock represents practice; the sand, mere sentiment. There is thus a partial correspondence with the works insisted on by St. James in contrast to a bare orthodox faith (<a href="/james/2-24.htm">James 2:24</a>). Assent is insufficient; there must be action. Not uncommonly, indeed, the rock is considered to refer to the Lord himself, and the sand to human effort. Cf. Ford: "The parallel passage (<a href="/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>), where the words, 'cometh unto Me,' are inserted, indicates clearly the foundation of <span class="accented">faith</span>, the receiving the Lord Jesus as our Prophet, Priest, and King, which is the only basis on which <span class="accented">good</span> works can be built" (cf. even Allord). This, however, is hardly exegesis, but application, for the "coming to Christ" is in Luke only introductory to the hearing and doing, and is altogether omitted here. Although the statement is true in itself, it is only so far proper to this passage in that, apart from practice, there is (ver. 23) no heart-union with Christ. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Therefore whosoever hoareth; Revised Version, <span class="accented">every one therefore which heareth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> , <a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).
