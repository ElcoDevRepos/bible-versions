In the context of the Garden of Gethsemane, this action signifies betrayal, as Judas leads the arresting party to Jesus. The act of going directly to Jesus shows Judas's familiarity and previous closeness with Him, emphasizing the personal nature of the betrayal. This moment fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the Messiah.<p><b>he said, &#8220;Greetings, Rabbi!&#8221;</b><br>Judas addresses Jesus as "Rabbi," a term of respect meaning "teacher." This title, while respectful, is also impersonal compared to "Lord," which the other disciples often used. The use of "Rabbi" by Judas may indicate a lack of true recognition of Jesus' divine authority. The greeting "Greetings" is a customary salutation, but in this context, it is laced with deceit, as Judas uses it to mask his betrayal. This moment is a stark contrast to the genuine reverence shown by others who recognized Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>and kissed Him.</b><br>The kiss was a common greeting in Jewish culture, symbolizing respect and affection. However, Judas's kiss is a perversion of this gesture, turning it into a signal for the arresting soldiers. This act of betrayal is particularly poignant because it uses a sign of friendship to deliver Jesus into the hands of His enemies. The kiss fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where the betrayal of the shepherd is foretold. It also serves as a type of Christ, illustrating how Jesus, the innocent and righteous one, is betrayed by those closest to Him, paralleling the experiences of Joseph in Genesis, who was betrayed by his brothers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrays Him to the religious leaders for thirty pieces of silver.
