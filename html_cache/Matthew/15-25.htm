In the cultural context of the time, a woman approaching a Jewish rabbi, especially a Gentile woman, was unusual and bold. Her act of kneeling signifies reverence and submission, recognizing Jesus' authority and power. This gesture is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals knelt before Jesus, acknowledging His divine nature (e.g., <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>, where a leper kneels before Jesus). The act of kneeling is also a physical expression of worship and supplication, indicating her faith in Jesus' ability to heal her daughter.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, help me!&#8221; she said.</b><br>The use of "Lord" by the woman is significant, as it denotes respect and recognition of Jesus' authority. In the New Testament, the term "Lord" is often used to address Jesus, acknowledging His divine status (e.g., <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>). Her plea, "help me," is a direct and heartfelt request, reflecting her desperation and faith. This cry for help is a common theme in the Psalms, where the psalmists often call upon the Lord in times of distress (e.g., <a href="/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>). The woman's plea is a model of persistent faith, as she continues to seek Jesus' intervention despite initial discouragement. Her faith is later commended by Jesus, illustrating the importance of perseverance in prayer and trust in God's mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

mother in territory outside Israel (v. 21). Her deliberate movement toward Jesus shows faith that crosses ethnic and cultural barriers (cf. <a href="/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-9</a>, she refuses to let past hostility keep her from the only One who can save.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> invites everyone to &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence,&#8221; and that is exactly what she does.<p>&#8226; Her coming illustrates <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, &#8220;Seek the Lord while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and knelt before Him</b><p>&#8226; Kneeling pictures humility and worship. Matthew consistently portrays true faith bowing before Christ:<p>&#8211; The healed leper: &#8220;a man with leprosy came and knelt before Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>).<p>&#8211; Jairus: &#8220;a synagogue ruler&#8230; knelt before Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> reminds us that &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.&#8221; This woman&#8217;s posture anticipates that universal submission.<p>&#8226; Her kneeling also signals persistence. She has already been met with silence (v. 23) and apparent refusal (v. 24), yet she doubles down in supplication rather than walking away (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Lord, help me!&#8221; she said</b><p>&#8226; The prayer is brief but packed with faith, acknowledging Jesus as &#8220;Lord&#8221; (cf. <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p>&#8226; It mirrors Peter&#8217;s desperate cry, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221; when sinking on the sea (<a href="/matthew/14-30.htm">Matthew 14:30</a>), proving that simple, sincere petitions reach Christ&#8217;s heart.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a> declares, &#8220;My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.&#8221; She believes that, even for her Gentile need.<p>&#8226; Her plea is maternal; she seeks deliverance for her tormented daughter (v. 22). Like the centurion interceding for his servant (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>), she exemplifies vicarious faith&#8212;trusting Jesus on behalf of another.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/15-25.htm">Matthew 15:25</a> captures a model approach to the Savior: come to Him personally, bow in humble worship, and cry out with trusting urgency. Jesus hears, responds, and ultimately honors such persevering faith, proving again that He is the compassionate Lord for Jew and Gentile alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Then came she and worshipped him.</span>--The word implies the act of prostrate homage.

The woman, nothing daunted by her rebuff and the disregard with which her appeal was received, followed him persistently, and, growing bolder in her importunity, fell as a suppliant at his feet. While he still seemed to repulse her, she was learning fresh faith and hope. <span class="cmt_word">Lord, help me.</span> She does not now call him "Son of David." She begins to feel that she has little claim upon him as the Jewish Messiah; she appeals rather to his mercy and his power. Still, she identifies herself, as at first, with her daughter; the only boon she wants for herself is her child's relief. "For she indeed (my daughter) is insensible of her disease, but it is I that suffer her innumerable woes; my disease is with consciousness, my madness with perception of itself" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hom. 52 in S. Matt.'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The woman] came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(elthousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] knelt before</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#954;&#973;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(prosekynei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4352.htm">Strong's 4352: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and a probable derivative of kuon; to fawn or crouch to, i.e. prostrate oneself in homage.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
