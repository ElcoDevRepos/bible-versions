The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian eschatology, affirming life after death and the eventual restoration of all things. The concept of resurrection is rooted in Old Testament scriptures such as <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, which speak of the dead rising to eternal life. The New Testament further develops this theme, with Jesus' own resurrection serving as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><b>whose wife will she be of the seven?</b><br>This question is part of a hypothetical scenario presented by the Sadducees, who are attempting to challenge the concept of resurrection by referencing the Levirate marriage law found in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. This law required a man to marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in the brother's name. The Sadducees' question is designed to ridicule the idea of resurrection by presenting a complex marital situation. However, it also highlights the cultural and legal practices of ancient Israel, where family lineage and inheritance were of significant importance.<p><b>For all of them were married to her.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the Sadducees' attempt to create a dilemma for Jesus by pointing out that all seven brothers were legally married to the same woman. The Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, are using this scenario to argue against the feasibility of life after death. Jesus' response, which follows in the subsequent verses, emphasizes that earthly institutions like marriage do not apply in the same way in the resurrection. This reflects the transformative nature of the resurrection life, where believers will be like the angels in heaven (<a href="/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>), indicating a different order of existence beyond earthly relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Matthew, who is being questioned by the Sadducees in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>- A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, who pose a hypothetical question to Jesus to challenge Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>- A hypothetical figure in the Sadducees' question, who was married to seven brothers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_brothers.htm">The Seven Brothers</a></b><br>- Hypothetical figures in the Sadducees' question, each of whom was married to the woman.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>- The event in question, which the Sadducees deny, but which Jesus affirms and teaches about.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>The Sadducees' question reveals a misunderstanding of the resurrection.
