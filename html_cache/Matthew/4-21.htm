This area was a hub of activity and commerce, with fishing being a primary industry. Jesus had just called Peter and Andrew, and His movement along the shore suggests a purposeful search for His disciples. The Sea of Galilee is significant in Jesus' ministry, serving as the backdrop for many of His teachings and miracles.<p><b>He saw two other brothers</b><br>The mention of "two other brothers" highlights the familial relationships among the disciples. This reflects the close-knit nature of Jewish families and communities at the time. The calling of brothers emphasizes the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry and the importance of family in the early Christian community.<p><b>James son of Zebedee and his brother John</b><br>James and John, often referred to as the "Sons of Thunder" (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>), were prominent figures among the disciples. Their father, Zebedee, was likely a man of some means, as indicated by the presence of hired men in <a href="/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>. James would later become the first apostolic martyr (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>), and John is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of John, three epistles, and Revelation.<p><b>They were in a boat with their father Zebedee</b><br>The presence of Zebedee in the boat suggests a family business, typical of the time, where sons would learn and work alongside their father. This setting underscores the sacrifice involved in following Jesus, as James and John would leave their family and livelihood. The boat symbolizes their current life and work, which they would abandon to become "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).<p><b>Mending their nets</b><br>Mending nets was a routine task for fishermen, necessary to maintain their livelihood. This detail highlights the everyday life of the disciples before their calling. The act of mending can symbolize preparation and readiness, as Jesus was about to call them to a new purpose. It also reflects the meticulous and patient nature required in their future ministry.<p><b>Jesus called them</b><br>The call of Jesus is authoritative and transformative. It signifies a divine invitation to a new life and mission. This calling is immediate and compelling, illustrating the power of Jesus' presence and word. The call to James and John parallels the call to Peter and Andrew, emphasizing the theme of discipleship and the radical response required to follow Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who calls His disciples to follow Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/james,_son_of_zebedee.htm">James, son of Zebedee</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, brother of John, known for his zeal and later martyrdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john,_brother_of_james.htm">John, brother of James</a></b><br>Another of the twelve apostles, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his contributions to the New Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebedee.htm">Zebedee</a></b><br>The father of James and John, a fisherman by trade, representing the familial and occupational context of the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>Represents the setting of their occupation and the place from which they are called to a new mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_follow.htm">The Call to Follow</a></b><br>Jesus' call is personal and direct.

It must be remembered, however, (1) that the "mending" as well as "washing" flowed naturally even on a night of unsuccessful fishing, and (2) that the Greek of St. Luke does not say that the nets actually broke, but that they were on the point of breaking, and were beginning to do so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Other two brethren</span> (cf. ver. 18, note); in Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">James the son of Zebedee</span>.

Probably Zebedee and his wife Salome became, unlike Peter's parents, well-known believers. It may be that Peter was the eldest of the Twelve, and that his father was already dead or, though perhaps believing on Jesus, was too old to take any special part in the work.
