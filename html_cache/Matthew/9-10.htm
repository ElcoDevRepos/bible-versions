Tax collectors were often despised by the Jewish people for collaborating with the Roman authorities and for their reputation of extortion. Matthew's willingness to host Jesus in his home signifies a radical transformation and acceptance of Jesus' call. The setting of a meal is significant in Jewish culture, symbolizing fellowship and acceptance. Jesus dining with Matthew indicates His mission to reach out to those marginalized by society.<p><b>many tax collectors and sinners came</b><br>The presence of many tax collectors and sinners highlights the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry. These individuals were often ostracized by the religious elite, yet they felt drawn to Jesus. This gathering demonstrates the impact of Matthew's conversion, as he invites his peers to meet Jesus. It also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as bringing good news to the poor and freedom to the captives.<p><b>and ate with Him and His disciples.</b><br>Sharing a meal in the ancient Near East was a sign of acceptance and community. By eating with tax collectors and sinners, Jesus breaks social and religious barriers, emphasizing His message of grace and redemption. This act foreshadows the inclusivity of the Gospel, which is later expanded to the Gentiles. It also prefigures the eschatological banquet described in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where all nations will feast together in the presence of God.

Compare the similar scene with Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting answers any doubt that Christ seeks out the lost where they live, not merely in religious settings (<a href="/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many tax collectors and sinners</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Many&#8221; tells us Matthew&#8217;s circle was large&#8212;and Jesus did not limit the guest list. <a href="/luke/15-1.htm">Luke 15:1&#8211;2</a> shows how crowds of outsiders felt safe approaching Him.<p>&#8226; Tax collectors collaborated with Rome and were despised; &#8220;sinners&#8221; covered everyone judged morally unclean.

The verse shows literal, historical fellowship that models gospel inclusion without diluting holiness. Jesus welcomes sinners who respond to His call, and He trains His followers to do the same, making the dinner table a living picture of mercy and mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">As Jesus sat at meat in the house.</span>--The Greek runs, <span class= "ital">as he sat at meat.</span> The insertion of the name Jesus in this part of the sentence injures the sense. What seems to have been meant is, that while Matthew sat (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> reclined after Roman fashion), many publicans and sinners came and reclined with Jesus and His disciples. On the assumption of St. Matthew's authorship of the Gospel, there is a noticeable humility in his omission of the fact that he had made "a great feast" (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm" title="And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.">Luke 5:29</a>). It was apparently a farewell feast to old friends and neighbours before he entered on his new calling. They were naturally mostly of his own class, or on a yet lower level. The publican was the pariah of Palestine, and no decent person would associate with him. The term "sinners" may have included Gentiles, but does not necessarily designate them. So far as the context goes, as in <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>, the term is used in its simple and natural sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> <span class="accented">- The feast with publicans and sinners</span>, <span class="accented">and Christ's apology.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/2-15.htm">Mark 2:15-17</a>; <a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29-32</a>. All three evangelists give the essential features of the section, but Mark and Luke show more clearly that the feast was in the house of the new disciple, and Matthew alone gives the reference to Hosea. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it</span> <span class="cmt_word">came to pass, as Jesus</span> (<span class="accented">he</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">sat at meat;</span> "Gr. <span class="accented">reclined</span>: and so always" (Revised Version margin); cf. ch. 26:20. <span class="cmt_word">In the house;</span> Luke, "And Levi made him a great feast in his house."
