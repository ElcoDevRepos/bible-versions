Situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, it was a bustling fishing village and trade center. This setting is crucial as it highlights the everyday life and interactions Jesus had with the people, emphasizing His accessibility and engagement with the community. Capernaum's frequent mention in the Gospels underscores its importance in Jesus' teaching and healing activities.<p><b>the collectors of the two-drachma tax</b><br>The two-drachma tax, also known as the temple tax, was an annual levy imposed on Jewish males for the maintenance of the temple in Jerusalem. This tax had its roots in the Mosaic Law, specifically in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-16</a>, where a half-shekel was required for the service of the tabernacle. By the time of Jesus, this tax was still collected, reflecting the ongoing religious obligations and the centrality of the temple in Jewish worship. The collectors were likely local agents responsible for gathering this tax, indicating the structured religious practices of the time.<p><b>came to Peter and asked</b><br>Peter, often seen as the spokesperson for the disciples, is approached directly by the tax collectors. This interaction suggests Peter's prominence among the disciples and his perceived leadership role. The approach to Peter rather than Jesus Himself may indicate a level of respect or caution, as well as the practical recognition of Peter's position within the group.<p><b>&#8220;Does your Teacher pay the two drachmas?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the tax collectors is both a query and a test. It reflects the societal expectations for religious teachers to adhere to Jewish customs and laws. The phrasing "your Teacher" acknowledges Jesus' role as a rabbi or teacher, while the question itself probes His adherence to traditional Jewish practices. This moment foreshadows the tension between Jesus' mission and the established religious norms, highlighting His fulfillment of the Law and His authority over it. The inquiry also sets the stage for Jesus to teach about His identity and mission, as well as the nature of His kingdom, which transcends earthly obligations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, often referred to as Jesus' "own city" (<a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>).

The latter is the <span class= "ital">census,</span> or Roman poll-tax; the former was the Temple-rate, paid by every male Israelite above the age of twenty (<a href="/context/exodus/30-13.htm" title="This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.">Exodus 30:13-16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-9.htm" title="And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 24:9</a>). It was fixed at a half-shekel a head, and the shekel being reckoned as equal to four Attic <span class= "ital">drachmae,</span> was known technically as the <span class= "ital">didrachma</span> (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> iii. 8, ? 2). It was collected even from the Jews in foreign countries, was paid into the <span class= "ital">Corban,</span> or treasury of the Temple, and was used to defray the expenses of its services. After the destruction of Jerusalem, Vespasian ordered that it should still be collected as before, and, as if adding insult to injury, be paid to the fund for rebuilding the Temple of the Capitoline Jupiter (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> vii. 6, ? 6). The three great festivals of the Jewish year were recognised as proper times for payment; and the relation of this narrative to John 7 makes it probable that the collectors were now calling in for the Feast of Tabernacles the payments that had not been made at the Passover or Pentecost previous. Their question implies that they half-thought that the Prophet of Nazareth had evaded or would disclaim payment. They were looking out for another transgression of the law, and as soon as He entered Capernaum (though He still held aloof from any public ministry), they tracked Him, probably to Peter's house, and put the question to His disciple. The narrative is remarkable both in itself and as found only in St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The coin in the fish's mouth</span>. This is one of the three miracles of our Lord which are peculiar to this Gospel St. Matthew seems to concern himself particularly with matters which present Jesus as King-Messiah; and this occurrence was in his view specially notable, as herein Christ claimed for himself a royal position - Son in his Father's house. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Capernaum</span>. Once more before the final scene he visited the spot so dear to his human heart - "his own city." <span class="cmt_word">They that received tribute money</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). This is an unfortunate rendering, as it may be taken to countenance an erroneous view of the demanded impost, found in many ancient and some modern commentaries, which vitiates their whole interpretation. According to this opinion, the tribute was a civil payment, like the <span class="accented">denarius</span> of <a href="/matthew/22-19.htm">Matthew 22:19</a>, levied by the Roman government, or a capitation tax imposed by Herod, the Tetrarch of Galilee (of which tax, however, we have no historical proof). That this is a misunderstanding is plain from many considerations. In the first place, the collectors are not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, publicans, but quite another set of people, called <span class="accented">they that received the didrachmas</span>. Again, the officers of government would not have made their demand mildly in an interrogative form, "Doth not your Master," etc.? but would have exhibited that violent and offensive behaviour which made them so hated among the Jews. The political tax is never termed <span class="accented">didrachma</span>, but always <span class="accented">census</span>, as in <a href="/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17, 19</a>; nor could Jesus have given the answer which is reported below, if the tax had been one levied in the interest of any earthly monarch, be it Caesar or Herod. <span class="accented">The didrachma</span> is a term denoting a well known rate, concerning which we have full information from many sources - biblical, Talmudic, and traditional. The <span class="accented">didrachma</span> was a silver coin equal to two Attic drachms, or, in Jewish money, to one half shekel of the sanctuary - something under our florin in weight. It was the amount of an ecclesiastical rate levied for religious purposes. Originally (<a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>, etc.) exacted as an acknowledgment and a thank offering, a ransom, as it were, for the lives rescued from Egypt, it had been used in the wilderness in providing the framework of the tabernacle and the ornamentation of its pillars. Based on this practice arose a custom that every male Israelite of twenty years old and upwards should annually contribute to the temple treasury the sum of a half shekel. Dr. Edersheim reckons the tribute in our Lord's time to have been equivalent to &pound;75,000 per annum. The money was stored in the temple treasury, and was expended partly in the purchase of the daily sacrifices, victims, incense, etc., in the payment of rabbis and other officials connected with the temple, in maintaining the efficiency of the water supply, and in keeping in repair the vast and magnificent buildings in the temple area. After all this outlay, there was always a large sum in hand, which proved a strong temptation to the greed of conquerors, and the sacred coffers were often plundered; and even after many previous spoliations, we read that Crassus ( <span class="date">B.C. 54</span>) carried off no less than two and a half millions sterling. The tax was due by the twenty-fifth of the month Adar (equivalent to February March), and the collectors who were appointed to or took upon themselves the office, opened stalls in; every country town for the reception of the money. For many centuries the rate was of a voluntary nature, considered, indeed, a religious duty, and to be evaded by no one, Pharisee or Sadducee, who wished to be regarded as an orthodox believer, but its payment had not been secured by any legal process. Lately, indeed, the penalty of distraint had been enacted in order to obtain the tax from defaulters; but it is doubtful whether this was generally enforced. Possibly the appointed day had now arrived, and the collectors thought right to stir in the matter. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Peter.</span> They applied to Peter instead of directly to Christ, perhaps out of respect for the latter, and from a certain awe with which he inspired them. Besides, Peter was their fellow townsman, and they doubtless knew him well His natural impulsiveness might have induced <span class="accented">him</span> to answer the call. It may also have been his own house, the other eleven being apparently staying with other friends, and Jesus with him ("me and thee," ver. 27). We may suppose that Jesus had complied with the demand on former occasions, when sojourning in his Galilaean home, so that the present application was only natural. <span class="cmt_word">Doth</span> <span class="cmt_word">not your Master</span> (<span class="greek_word">o( Dida/skalo u(mw = n</span>, <span class="accented">your Teacher</span>) <span class="cmt_word">pay tribute</span> (<span class="accented">the didrachma</span>)? Perhaps the form of the question might be better rendered, "Your Teacher pays the two drachms, does he not?" The pronoun "your" is plural, because they recognized that Jesus was at the head of a band of disciples, who would be influenced by his example. We may in this inquiry see other motives besides the obvious one. If Jesus paid the rate now without question, he would prove that he was nothing more than an ordinary Jew, with no claim to a higher origin or a Divine mission. Though not a priest or Levite, Jesus might have claimed exemption as a recognized rabbi, and the collectors may have desired to ascertain whether he would do this. There was, too, at this time a sect which, in its furious patriotism, refused to contribute aught to the temple so long as the holy city was profaned by the presence of the heathen. Did Christ belong to this body? And would he carry out their programme? If from any cause he declined the contribution, this abstention would give a handle to those who were not prepared to endorse his claims: the breach of such a generally recognized obligation would raise a prejudice against him, and weaken the effect of his acts and teaching. Some such motives may have contributed to inspire the question now asked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
