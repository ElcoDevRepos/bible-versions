The sending of "other servants" suggests a repeated effort to reach out, reflecting God's enduring patience and desire for people to respond to His call. In biblical context, servants often represent prophets or messengers of God, who were sent repeatedly to the people of Israel throughout history. This mirrors the Old Testament narrative where God sent prophets to call Israel back to faithfulness.<p><b>&#8216;Tell those who have been invited</b><br>The invitation is extended to those who were already on the guest list, symbolizing the Jewish people who were the first to receive God's covenant promises. This reflects the historical context of Israel as God's chosen people, who were given the Law and the Prophets. The invitation also implies a personal and direct call, emphasizing the relational aspect of God's kingdom.<p><b>that I have prepared my dinner.</b><br>The preparation of a dinner signifies readiness and abundance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a prepared meal was a sign of hospitality and honor. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual blessings and salvation that God has prepared for His people. It echoes the prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where a feast is prepared for all peoples.<p><b>My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed,</b><br>The mention of oxen and fattened cattle indicates a lavish and costly preparation, symbolizing the richness of God's provision. In the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, the killing of animals was a part of worship and atonement. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice, providing atonement for sin through His death.<p><b>and everything is ready.</b><br>This statement underscores the completeness and sufficiency of God's provision. It suggests that nothing is lacking in what God offers, and it is available now. The readiness of the feast parallels the readiness of the kingdom of heaven, as proclaimed by Jesus in His ministry.<p><b>Come to the wedding banquet.&#8217;</b><br>The invitation to a wedding banquet symbolizes joy, celebration, and union. In biblical terms, a wedding feast often represents the Messianic banquet, a future event where believers will be united with Christ. This imagery is consistent with <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, which speaks of the "marriage supper of the Lamb." The call to "come" is an open invitation to partake in the blessings of God's kingdom, emphasizing the inclusivity and grace extended to all who will accept.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, who is preparing a wedding banquet for His Son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize the prophets and messengers sent by God to invite people to His kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invited_guests.htm">The Invited Guests</a></b><br>Initially represent the Jewish people, who were the first to receive God's invitation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding_banquet.htm">The Wedding Banquet</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Kingdom of Heaven and the ultimate union of Christ with His Church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oxen_and_fattened_cattle.htm">The Oxen and Fattened Cattle</a></b><br>Represent the abundance and generosity of God's provision and the richness of His invitation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_persistent_invitation.htm">God's Persistent Invitation</a></b><br>God continually reaches out to humanity, offering His grace and invitation to eternal life.

The verse pleads: recognize the privilege, see the feast is ready through Christ, and freely come without delay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">My dinner.</span>--The Greek word points to a morning meal, as contrasted with the "supper," or evening meal; but, like all such words, (as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> our own dinner), was applied, as time passed on, to meals at very different hours. In Homer it is used of food taken at sunrise; in later authors, of the repast of noon.<p><span class= "bld">My oxen and my fatlings are killed.</span>--The words point, under an imagery which Isaiah had already used (25:6), to the spiritual blessings of peace and joy which Christ came to offer. In the "fatlings" we have nearly the same word as in the "fatted calf" of <a href="/luke/15-30.htm" title="But as soon as this your son was come, which has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.">Luke 15:30</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Other servants.</span> The apostles and their immediate followers after the death and resurrection of Christ, and the effusion of the Holy Ghost.
