In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is addressing the Jewish understanding of the Law. The "least of these commandments" refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites. Jesus is highlighting that even the smallest commandment holds significance. This reflects the Jewish tradition of treating the entire Law as a unified whole, where breaking even a minor commandment is seen as serious. The phrase also underscores the comprehensive nature of God's expectations for His people.<p><b>and teaches others to do likewise</b><br>Teaching others to break commandments compounds the offense. In Jewish culture, teachers and rabbis held significant influence, and their interpretations of the Law shaped community practices. This phrase warns against leading others astray, which is a grave responsibility. <a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a> echoes this sentiment, cautioning that teachers will be judged more strictly. The role of a teacher is not only to impart knowledge but to model obedience to God's commandments.<p><b>will be called least in the kingdom of heaven;</b><br>Being "called least" in the kingdom of heaven suggests a loss of honor or status. The kingdom of heaven is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's reign and the community of believers. This phrase implies that there are varying degrees of honor within the kingdom, based on one's faithfulness to God's commandments. It serves as a warning that disobedience and leading others into disobedience have consequences, even for those who are part of the kingdom.<p><b>but whoever practices and teaches them</b><br>This phrase highlights the dual responsibility of obedience and instruction. Practicing the commandments involves living a life that aligns with God's will, while teaching them involves guiding others in the same path. This reflects the holistic approach to faith that Jesus advocates, where belief is demonstrated through action. The emphasis on both practicing and teaching aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to teach others to obey everything He has commanded.<p><b>will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</b><br>Being "called great" signifies honor and recognition in God's kingdom. This phrase suggests that those who faithfully adhere to and teach God's commandments will be rewarded. It reflects the biblical principle that God honors those who honor Him, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>. The concept of greatness in the kingdom is not based on worldly standards but on faithfulness and obedience to God's will. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/23-11.htm">Matthew 23:11</a>, where He states that the greatest among His followers will be the servant of all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the Sermon on the Mount, delivering teachings on the law and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing followers of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_heaven.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, referring to God's sovereign rule and the realm of eternal life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/commandments.htm">Commandments</a></b><br>Refers to the laws and teachings given by God, particularly those found in the Old Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sermon_on_the_mount.htm">Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, a collection of Jesus' teachings found in Matthew chapters 5-7.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that even the least of the commandments are important.

Practicing and teaching the whole counsel of Scripture, however, earns the Savior&#8217;s commendation and eternal reward. The passage calls each disciple to wholehearted obedience that overflows into faithful instruction, confident that the King notices and will judge righteously.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Shall break one of these least commandments.</span>--The words seem at first to imply that even the ceremonial law was to be binding in its full extent upon Christ's disciples. The usage of the time, however, confined the word to the moral laws of God (as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/32-23.htm" title="In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.">Ecclesiasticus 32:23-24</a>), and throughout the New Testament it is never used in any other sense, with the possible exception of <a href="/hebrews/7-5.htm" title="And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:">Hebrews 7:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a> (comp. especially <a href="/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>). And the context, which proceeds at once to deal with moral laws and does not touch on ceremonial, is in accordance with this meaning. The "least commandments," then, are those which seemed trivial, yet were really great--the control of thoughts, desires, words, as compared with the apparently greater commands that dealt with acts. The reference to "teaching" shows that our Lord was speaking to His disciples, as the future instructors of mankind, and the obvious import of His words is that they were to raise, not lower, the standard of righteousness which had been recognised previously.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.</span>--The consequence of tampering with the great laws of duty, or the least laws, which are practically great, is described in terms at once severe and gentle; gentle, because the sentence, where the guilt is not wilful, or is repented of, is not one of absolute exclusion from the kingdom; severe in so far as being the "least" in that kingdom, the object of pity or sorrow to others, involved a severe humiliation to those who aimed at being the highest. To that condemnation many in every age of the Church have been liable, the Anthiomian fanatic and the Jesuit casuist standing so far on the same footing. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Matthew only. As Christ honoured the Law (ver. 17) so are his disciples to honour it. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever therefore</span>. Seeing that every part of the Law is of permanent value. In this verse our Lord once for all declares his opposition to antinomianism. Every one of the commands in the Law is, in its true and ideal meaning, still binding. <span class="cmt_word">Shall break</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). Not merely in contrast to "do" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) in the sense of "transgress" (Fritzsche), but "abrogate" (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>, "Not the violation of the sanctity of the day in a special case, but the abrogation of the duty of observance;" cf. also <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). It expresses, indeed, a less complete abrogation than <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 17), because, while speaking of himself, the Lord could use the strongest word possible, and that with reference to the whole Law or the Prophets; but here his expression is limited by the inability of any individual disciple to carry out an abrogation even of one command<span class="cmt_word">. One of these least commandments.</span> Not necessarily such as the Pharisees reckoned least, in their enumeration of small and great, but such as our Lord himself symbolized by "jot" or "tittle;" those precepts which in reality are the least important (Meyer). Chrysostom strangely says that our Lord here refers, not to old laws, but to those which he was about to lay down; similarly Bengel thinks of vers. 22-28, etc. While the Jews distinguished carefully between small and great precepts, they insisted on the importance of keeping even the smallest; cf. 'Ab.,' 4:5 (Taylor), "Hasten to a slight precept.., for the reward of precept is precept." <span class="cmt_word">And shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach men so.</span> Doing his best to abrogate it, not only in his own person by neglect or violation, but also for others by teaching them to disregard it. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be called the least</span>. The Revised Version omits "he, .... the." He is not cast out of the kingdom ("Ubi nisi magni esse non possunt," Augustine), but his want of moral insight (did he consider it "breadth of thought"?) leads to his being called <span class="accented">least</span> in the kingdom. It is the converse of the parable in <a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc. There faithfulness in a very little (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>) wins much; here disregard of a very little causes a person to be reckoned (ver. 9, note) as very little - the principle of judgment being that of <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in avery little is unrighteous also in much." <span class="cmt_word">In the kingdom of heaven</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably in its full and final establishment. The doctrine of grades of blessedness and of punishment hereafter is clearly taught in Scripture (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But whosoever shall do and teach them</span>. Similarly the Revised Version; but rather supply "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is required in the smallest commandment" (Meyer). The personal performance and conscious spreading of one of the least commandments will be found to involve so much that it gains for the person a high position. <span class="cmt_word">Do and teach</span>. For many will perform a command without taking any conscious part in spreading it. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">same;</span> Revised Version, he (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Why inserted here and not in the previous clause? Partly because of the awkwardness of inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there so soon after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>; partly because our Lord wished to lay stress there on the recompense, here on the person ("he and no other") who receives recompense. On the thought, cf. 'Test. XII. Parr.' (Levi., &sect; 13), "If he teach these things and practise them, he shall share the throne of the king, as also Joseph our brother." It is worth adding Tyndale's remark in his 'Exposition,' "Whosoever shall first fulfil them [these least commandments following] himself, and then teach other, and set all his study to the furtherance and maintaining of them, that doctor shall all they of the kingdom of heaven have in price, and follow him and seek him out, as doth an eagle her prey, and cleave to him as burrs." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/5-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
