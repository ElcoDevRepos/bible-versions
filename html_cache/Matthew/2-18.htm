It is historically significant as a place where the prophet Samuel was born and buried. In the context of <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>, Ramah is symbolic of the collective grief of Israel. The "voice" signifies a prophetic utterance, echoing the lamentation found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. This prophecy originally referred to the Babylonian exile, where captives were gathered in Ramah before being taken to Babylon. The New Testament application connects this lament to the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem, showing the fulfillment of prophecy through the events surrounding Jesus' early life.<p><b>weeping and great mourning</b><br>The intense sorrow described here reflects the deep anguish experienced by the mothers of Bethlehem. This phrase captures the emotional depth of the tragedy, emphasizing the severity of Herod's actions. The mourning is not just personal but communal, affecting the entire region. This mirrors the historical context of Israel's suffering and exile, drawing a parallel between past and present grief.<p><b>Rachel weeping for her children</b><br>Rachel, the beloved wife of Jacob, is considered the matriarch of Israel. Her weeping symbolizes the sorrow of the nation, as she is metaphorically mourning for her descendants. Rachel's tomb, located near Bethlehem, adds geographical significance to this lament. The imagery of Rachel weeping connects to <a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19-20</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, where Rachel's sorrow is emblematic of the collective suffering of Israel. This typology points to the broader narrative of redemption and hope, as Rachel's weeping precedes the promise of restoration in Jeremiah.<p><b>and refusing to be comforted</b><br>This phrase highlights the depth of despair and the inconsolable nature of the loss. The refusal to be comforted underscores the magnitude of the tragedy, as the mothers of Bethlehem cannot be consoled in the face of such devastating loss. This reflects the cultural context of mourning in ancient Israel, where expressions of grief were profound and communal. Theologically, it points to the human condition and the need for divine intervention and comfort.<p><b>because they are no more</b><br>The finality of this phrase emphasizes the irreversible nature of the tragedy. The children "are no more," indicating their death and the end of their earthly lives. This echoes the historical reality of the massacre and the fulfillment of prophecy. It also serves as a somber reminder of the cost of sin and the brokenness of the world, setting the stage for the redemptive work of Christ. Theologically, it points to the hope of resurrection and eternal life, where death is ultimately conquered through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>A town in ancient Israel, traditionally associated with the tribe of Benjamin.

<a href="/matthew/2-17.htm">Matthew 2:17&#8211;18</a> cites <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> verbatim, showing that God intentionally tied the sorrow of exile to the sorrow caused by Herod&#8217;s slaughter (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when evil kings scheme, God&#8217;s voice is still &#8220;heard,&#8221; affirming His sovereignty and the certainty of His word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Weeping and great mourning</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underlines both depth and breadth of grief; every family that lost a child felt a personal catastrophe (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never minimizes pain. It names it honestly, validating godly lament (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Matthew records the massacre to show that Jesus&#8217; entrance into the world occurred amid real, measurable human suffering (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rachel weeping for her children</b><p>&#8226; Rachel, who died giving birth to Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16-20</a>), personifies the mothers of Israel.

Rachel&#8217;s uncomforted grief points forward to the comfort only Jesus can bring&#8212;life that overcomes death, restoration that undoes exile, and joy that silences every Ramah-born cry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">In Rama was there a voice heard.</span>--Here again we have an example of St. Matthew's application of a passage that had a direct bearing upon the events of the time when it was delivered to those which his narrative had brought before him. The tomb of Rachel, "in the way to Ephrath, which <span class= "ital">is</span> Bethlehem" (<a href="/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a>), had been, probably from the day when the "pillar" which marked it was first set up, one of the sacred places of the land. It was so in the days of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm" title="When you are departed from me to day, then you shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went to seek are found: and, see, your father has left the care of the asses, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?">1Samuel 10:2</a>). The language of Jeremiah in <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, shows that it was so in his time. In his picture of the sufferings and slaughter of the captives of Judah, the image which best embodied his feelings of sorrow for his people was that of Rachel, as the great "mother in Israel," seeing, as from the "high place" of her sepulchre (this is the meaning of the name Ramah), the shame and death of her children at the other Ramah, a few miles further to the north, and weeping for her bereavement. Historically, as we find from <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, this was the place to which the prisoners were dragged, that Nebuzaradan might assign "such as were for death" to death, others to exile, and others again to remain as bondsmen in the land. That picture, St. Matthew felt, had been reproduced once again. The tomb of Rachel was as familiar to the people of Bethlehem (it stands but one mile to the north of the town) as it had been in the time of Jeremiah, and the imagery was therefore as natural in the one case as the other.
