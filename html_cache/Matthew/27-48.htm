The person who ran is traditionally understood to be one of the Roman soldiers or bystanders present at the crucifixion. The use of a sponge was common in the Roman world for various purposes, including cleaning and applying liquids. The quick response may indicate a desire to alleviate Jesus' suffering, albeit in a limited way, or to mock Him further, as some interpretations suggest.<p><b>He filled it with sour wine,</b><br>Sour wine, or vinegar, was a cheap, common drink for soldiers and laborers in the Roman Empire. It was known as "posca" and was a diluted wine vinegar. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me vinegar for my thirst." The offering of sour wine to Jesus is significant as it connects to the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering.<p><b>put it on a reed,</b><br>The reed, likely a hyssop stalk, was used to extend the sponge to Jesus' mouth. Hyssop has symbolic significance in the Bible, being used in the Old Testament for purification rituals (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>, <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>). This act can be seen as a type of purification, even in the midst of Jesus' suffering, symbolizing the cleansing power of His sacrifice.<p><b>and held it up for Jesus to drink.</b><br>This gesture, whether intended as an act of mercy or mockery, allowed Jesus to fulfill His statement, "I thirst" (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>), which was another fulfillment of Scripture. The act of giving Jesus something to drink during His crucifixion underscores His humanity and the physical suffering He endured.

Every detail&#8212;speed, sponge, sour wine, reed, the raised drink&#8212;confirms God&#8217;s Word as accurate and intentional, drawing us to trust the One who thirsted so that we might never thirst again (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(48) <span class= "bld">Took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar.</span>--The "vinegar" was the sour wine, or wine and water, which was the common drink of the Roman soldiers. and which they at an earlier stage, and as in derision (<a href="/luke/23-36.htm" title="And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,">Luke 23:36</a>), had offered to the Sufferer. The sponge had probably served instead of a cork to the jar in which the soldiers had brought the drink that was to sustain them in their long day's work.
