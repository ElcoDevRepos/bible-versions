They were to meet a man "bearing a pitcher of water" and follow him. and were to see in the house into which he entered that in which they were to make their preparations. The master of the house was probably a disciple, but secretly, like many others, "for fear of the Jews" (<a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>), and this may explain the suppression of his name. He was, at any rate, one who would acknowledge the authority of the Master in whose name the disciples spoke. In the other two Gospels our Lord describes the large upper room furnished which the disciples would find on entering. The signal may have been agreed upon before, or may have been the result of a supernatural prescience. Scripture is silent, and either supposition is legitimate.<p><span class= "bld">My time is at hand.</span>--For the disciples, the "time" may have seemed the long-expected season of His manifesting Himself as King, and the memory of such words as those of <a href="/john/7-8.htm" title="Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.">John 7:8</a> ("My time is not yet full come") may have seemed to strengthen the impression. We read, as it were, between the lines, and see that it was the "time" of the suffering and death which were the conditions of His true glory (<a href="/john/12-23.htm" title="And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.">John 12:23</a>; <a href="/john/13-32.htm" title="If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.">John 13:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The city.</span> Jerusalem. Jesus was at Bethany. St. Luke says that he sent Peter and John, now first joined together without James. To such a man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). The other synoptists mention certain signs by which they were to recognize the man. At the entrance of the city they would meet a man bearing a pitcher of water; they were to follow him to the house whither he went, and then give their message to the master of the house. There is a great similarity between this mission and that concerning the ass before the triumphal entry. The foreknowledge and the precision in directions are quite analogous. The "good man" was doubtless a disciple, though at this festival all strangers were freely received by any householder who had accommodation. Dr. Edersheim supposes that he was father of Mark, who was the "young man" arrested by the company that took Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a>). The secrecy observed in the above-mentioned arrangement was intended to keep the knowledge from Judas, and thus to secure immunity from interruption at the solemn meal. The traitor seems to have sneaked out from the last Supper, and disclosed Christ's retreat to the Jewish authorities, and conducted them to the house; but, finding that Jesus had left the room, he led them to Gethsemane, whither he knew that Jesus often resorted (<a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Master.</span> A disciple would know who was meant by this title (comp. <a href="/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8, 10</a>; <a href="/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>). Whether any previous arrangement had been made with him, we cannot tell; most probably Christ speaks from prevision and his providential ordering of events. <span class="cmt_word">My time is at hand.</span> The time of my suffering and death. This fact would make the request more imperative. But the expression was mysterious and indefinite. <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">keep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, I <span class="accented">keep</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Passover at thy house.</span> The Passover which the Lord was to keep was not the usual Paschal meal, as the lamb could not be legally killed till the 14th, but a commemorative anticipatory feast in which he himself was the Lamb - "the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." Of that Lamb the apostles did mystically eat when Christ gave them the bread and wine with the words, "This is my body;" "This is my blood." This Supper, which was virtually the new Passover, seems traditionally to have become confounded with the usual Paschal solemnity; hence the language of the synoptists assumes a form which is applicable to the regular Jewish feast. This explanation, if it seems to derogate somewhat from the precise verbal accuracy of the evangelists, would probably be confirmed if we were better acquainted with the customs then prevalent, and with the current meaning of the language employed. The ambiguity in the accounts may be divinely intended to call attention to the fact that the last Supper was not the Jewish Passover, but the Christian Passover - not the sacrifice on the cross, but an anticipation thereof. We may observe in passing that there is no mention of the lamb in the celebration; Peter and John were not enjoined to provide one, nor are they said to have visited the temple - which, indeed, on the 13th would have been useless: and yet to obtain the lamb in any other way would have been a breach of the Law, which we cannot suppose Christ would sanction. We may also notice that the word "feast" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>) is nowhere applied to the last Supper, though it is always employed in reference to the Jewish solemnity. St. Paul, in his account of the institution of the Holy Communion (<a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>.) makes no mention of any Paschal solemnities or associations, but merely states that it was appointed on the night in which Jesus was betrayed. <span class="cmt_word">With my disciples;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the twelve apostles; none but these, not even the master of the house, were present at this solemn scene. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
