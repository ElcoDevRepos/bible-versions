His life and ministry are a culmination of the prophetic tradition, bridging the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he</b><br>This phrase introduces a paradox, contrasting earthly greatness with spiritual greatness in the kingdom of heaven. It suggests that the new covenant, inaugurated by Jesus, offers a greater spiritual reality than the old covenant. The least in the kingdom of heaven, through faith in Christ, possesses a greater position because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the benefits of the new covenant.

Unlike earlier prophets who foresaw Messiah from afar (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>), John points directly and immediately: &#8220;Look, the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8211; He is filled with the Holy Spirit from the womb (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>) and uncompromising in holiness and courage (<a href="/matthew/14-4.htm">Matthew 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; appraisal is not hyperbole; it is divine assessment. No prior prophet enjoyed a higher calling or clearer revelation than John (<a href="/luke/7-28.htm">Luke 7:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he</b><p>Here Jesus introduces a breathtaking contrast.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The kingdom of heaven&#8221; is the new-covenant realm inaugurated by Christ&#8217;s ministry, death, and resurrection (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6, 13</a>).

Yet they also highlight the superlative blessings of the new covenant: even the humblest believer who has entered Christ&#8217;s kingdom now enjoys a richer privilege, clearer revelation, and closer relationship with God than John possessed before the cross. The verse therefore magnifies both John&#8217;s outstanding role and the immeasurable grace poured out on every follower of Jesus today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">There hath not risen a greater.</span>--The greatness of men is measured by a divine not a human standard. The prophet, who was more than a prophet, the herald or the forerunner of the kingdom, was greater in his work, his holiness, his intuition of the truth, than the far-off patriarchs, than David or Solomon, and, <span class= "ital">a fortiori,</span> than the conquerors and the destroyers, such as Alexander, Pompey, Herod, on whom the world bestowed the title of "the great" ones.<p><span class= "bld">He that is least in the kingdom of heaven.</span>--The Greek gives the comparative, not the superlative--he whose relative position in the kingdom of heaven is less than that of John. Very many commentators have thought, strangely enough, that our Lord referred in these words to Himself. He in the eyes of men was esteemed less than the Baptist, and yet was really greater. But this is surely not the meaning of the words. (1) It would be but a poor truism to have declared that the King was greater than the herald; and (2) there is no example of our Lord's so speaking of Himself elsewhere. On the other hand, He does speak of His disciples as the "little ones" who believe on Him (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm" title="And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.">Matthew 10:42</a>), and as applied to them the words have a meaning at once natural and adequate. The least of His disciples, rejoicing in His presence, in communion with Him, in His revelation of the Father, though less than John in fame, work, the rigour of ascetic holiness, was yet above him in the knowledge of the truth, and therefore in blessedness and joy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>.
