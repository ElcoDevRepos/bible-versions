The "feast" mentioned is the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which includes the Passover. This was a significant time for the Jewish people, commemorating their deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12). The city of Jerusalem would have been crowded with pilgrims, increasing the potential for public unrest. The leaders were aware of Jesus' popularity among the people, as seen in His triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8-11</a>), and they feared that arresting Him during such a public and sacred time could incite a backlash.<p><b>they said,</b><br>The "they" refers to the chief priests and elders of the people, who were plotting to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill Him (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>). This group was part of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which held significant religious and political power. Their discussions and decisions were made in secret, highlighting their fear of public opinion and their desire to maintain control without causing a disturbance.<p><b>or there may be a riot among the people.</b><br>The leaders were concerned about a "riot" because Jesus had a large following, and many believed Him to be a prophet (<a href="/matthew/21-46.htm">Matthew 21:46</a>). The Roman authorities, who governed Judea, were known for their harsh response to civil disorder, and a riot could lead to severe consequences for the Jewish leaders, including loss of their positions or increased Roman intervention. This fear of the people is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as seen in their reluctance to arrest Jesus openly (<a href="/mark/14-2.htm">Mark 14:2</a>). The leaders' concern for maintaining order and their own authority ultimately led them to seek a more discreet way to arrest Jesus, which they found through Judas Iscariot's betrayal (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish community who were plotting to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill Him.

The assembled multitudes did not leave the city until the close of the octave, so the danger of a rising was not removed till then. The rulers well knew the stern temper of Pilate the procurator, who was prepared to crush any popular movement with the strong hand, and at festival times had always his soldiers ready to hurl upon the mob at the slightest provication, and to deal indiscriminate slaughter. Hence arose the plan of a clandestine apprehension. It was, indeed, the custom to execute great criminals at the time of the chief festivals, in order to impress the spectacle of retribution upon the greatest number; but in the case of Jesus, after what had occurred during the last few days, and when Jerusalem was filled with Galilaeans, who might naturally favour their countryman's pretensions, it was deemed dangerous to make any open attack. Their fears were relieved in the most unexpected manner by the appearance of Judas among them (ver. 14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
