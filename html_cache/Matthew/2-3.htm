His reign was marked by significant building projects, including the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. Herod was known for his paranoia and ruthless measures to secure his throne, including the execution of family members. The news that disturbed him was the birth of Jesus, whom the Magi referred to as the "King of the Jews." This title threatened Herod's rule, as he was not of Jewish descent but an Idumean, and his authority was granted by Rome. The prophecy of a new king from the line of David would have been particularly unsettling for Herod, who was aware of Jewish expectations for a Messiah.<p><b>he was disturbed</b><br>Herod's disturbance reflects his fear of losing power. Historically, Herod's reaction is consistent with his character; he was known for his violent responses to perceived threats. The Greek word used here can also mean "agitated" or "troubled," indicating a deep emotional turmoil. This reaction foreshadows Herod's later actions, including the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem, as he sought to eliminate any potential rival to his throne.<p><b>and all Jerusalem with him</b><br>The phrase suggests that Herod's fear and agitation spread to the city of Jerusalem. This could be due to several factors: the political instability that often accompanied Herod's violent actions, the potential for Roman intervention, or the religious implications of the Magi's announcement. Jerusalem, as the center of Jewish religious life, would have been acutely aware of messianic prophecies. The city's disturbance may also reflect the tension between the Jewish populace and their Roman-appointed ruler. The arrival of the Magi and their quest for the newborn king would have been a significant event, stirring both hope and fear among the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_herod.htm">King Herod</a></b><br>Known as Herod the Great, he was the Roman-appointed king of Judea.

Two years before he had put to death, on a charge of treason, his two sons by Mariamne, his best-loved wife, through sheer jealousy of the favour with which the people looked on them. At the time when this history opens, his eldest son, Antipater, was under condemnation. The knowledge that priests and people were alike looking for the "consolation of Israel" (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="/luke/2-38.htm" title="And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.">Luke 2:38</a>), the whispers that told that such a consolation had come, the uneasiness excited in the people by the "taxing" in which he had been forced to acquiesce, all these were elements of disquietude prior to the arrival of the Magi, and turned the last days of the Idumaean prince (his subjects never forgot his origin) into a time of frenzied and cruel suspicion. The excitement naturally spread throughout the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span>; <span class="accented">and when</span>, Revised Version. There is a contrast (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>) between the eager question of the Magi and the feelings of Herod. <span class="cmt_word">Herod</span> <span class="cmt_word">the king</span>. In the true text the emphasis is not on the person (as in ver. 1, where the date was all-important), but on the office as then exercised. Tile king visibly regnant is contrasted with him who was born to be King. Heard. Through some of his many sources of information, for "there were spies set everywhere" (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 15:10. 4). <span class="cmt_word">These things</span>; <span class="accented">it</span>, Revised Version. Nothing is expressed in the original. <span class="cmt_word">He was troubled</span>; perplexed, agitated (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Fully in accordance with his jealous and suspicious character. For he had already slain, as actual or possible candidates for the throne, five of the Maccabean princes and princesses, including his favourite wife Mariamne (thus extirpating the direct line) and also his two sons by Mariamne. Josephus ('Ant.,' 17:02. 4; cf. Holtzmann) mentions a prediction of the Pharisees towards the end of Herod's life, that "God had decreed that Herod's government should cease, and his posterity should be deprived of it." This seems to have a Messianic reference, though used at the time for an intrigue in favour of Pheroras, Herod's brother. <span class="cmt_word">And all Jerusalem</span>. The feminine (here only, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) points to a Hebrew source. The reason for the inhabitants of Jerusalem feeling troubled is generally explained, by their fear, which was in fact only too well justified by experience, that the news would excite Herod to fresh crimes. It is also possible that many would shrink from the changes which the coming of Messiah could not but bring. Present ease, though only comparative, is with the unbelieving preferable to possibilities of the highest blessedness. <a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a> affords both a parallel and a contrast. <span class="cmt_word">With him</span>.
