His standing up indicates a moment of heightened tension and authority. In Jewish trials, the high priest played a crucial role in maintaining order and ensuring the proceedings adhered to religious law. This moment is pivotal as it reflects the seriousness of the accusations against Jesus. Caiaphas's actions fulfill the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers take counsel against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>&#8220;Have You no answer?</b><br>This question highlights the silence of Jesus, which fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is described as being oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening His mouth. Jesus's silence can be seen as a demonstration of His submission to God's will and His awareness of the necessity of His sacrifice. In the cultural context, remaining silent in the face of accusations could be seen as an admission of guilt, yet Jesus's silence is a profound statement of His innocence and divine purpose.<p><b>What are these men testifying against You?&#8221;</b><br>The testimony against Jesus was based on false accusations, as seen earlier in the chapter. The Jewish leaders sought false witnesses to justify their predetermined decision to condemn Him. This reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>, where David speaks of false witnesses rising against him. The trial of Jesus was marked by legal irregularities, as Jewish law required at least two witnesses to agree for a conviction, and their testimonies did not align. This moment underscores the injustice of the trial and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus's suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest at this time was Caiaphas, who played a significant role in the trial of Jesus.

Caiaphas, the high priest, rises&#8212;an action that signals authority and intensifies the drama of this midnight trial (see <a href="/mark/14-60.htm">Mark 14:60</a>). His posture underscores the seriousness of the proceeding and the resolve to condemn Jesus. Throughout Scripture, when leaders stand to address an assembly, it often marks a pivotal turning point (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-56</a>). Here, that turning point is the push to secure an accusation that will justify sentencing the Son of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked Him,</b><p>Caiaphas engages Jesus directly, assuming the role of interrogator. By stepping out of impartial adjudication into aggressive questioning, the high priest abandons any pretense of fairness. Similar confrontations occur when religious leaders challenge Jesus in <a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3-6</a> and <a href="/luke/20-1.htm">Luke 20:1-2</a>, yet each time He exposes their hypocrisy. The high priest&#8217;s question intends to corner Jesus, but it ultimately highlights the contrast between earthly authority and divine authority standing before him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have You no answer?&#8221;</b><p>Silence can be a powerful declaration. Jesus&#8217; restraint fulfills <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth&#8221;. By refusing to defend Himself, Jesus demonstrates submission to the Father&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). His silence also exposes the weakness of the case against Him; if convincing evidence existed, no response would be necessary. Compare Paul&#8217;s later example before Festus in <a href="/acts/25-8.htm">Acts 25:8-9</a>, where a defense is offered, showing that silence here is a deliberate, prophetic choice, not inability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What are these men testifying against You?&#8221;</b><p>Caiaphas refers to earlier false witnesses whose testimonies failed to agree (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56-59</a>). The question tries to pressure Jesus into self-incrimination because the accusers cannot supply a consistent charge. <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> requires two or three witnesses for a capital conviction, underscoring the illegitimacy of this trial. The high priest&#8217;s frustration reveals that no truthful accusation can stand against the sinless Messiah (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). This moment accentuates the contrast between human schemes and God&#8217;s unassailable righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/26-62.htm">Matthew 26:62</a> portrays a desperate religious court confronting the silent, sovereign Savior. The high priest&#8217;s authoritative stance, probing questions, and reliance on shaky testimonies cannot eclipse Jesus&#8217; quiet fulfillment of prophecy and unwavering submission to the Father&#8217;s will. The verse highlights both the miscarriage of human justice and the perfection of God&#8217;s redemptive plan&#8212;echoing through the cross to assure believers that Christ&#8217;s innocence secures our salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(62) <span class= "bld">Answerest thou nothing?</span>--A different punctuation gives, <span class= "ital">Answerest Thou nothing to what these witness against Thee?</span> as one question. The question implies a long-continued silence, while witness after witness were uttering their clumsy falsehoods, the effect of which it is not easy to realise without a more than common exercise of what may be called dramatic imagination. I remember hearing from a distinguished scholar who had seen the Ammergau Passion-mystery, that, as represented there, it came upon him with a force which he had never felt before. In the silence itself we may perhaps trace a deliberate fulfilment of the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>.

As if in indignation at the outrage offered by this vaunt to Jehovah and the sanctuary. But the indignation was assumed and theatrical; for even this charge had broken down, owing to the disagreement of the two witnesses (<a href="/mark/14-59.htm">Mark 14:59</a>).
