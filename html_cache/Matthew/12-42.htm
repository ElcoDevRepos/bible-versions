Sheba is believed to be located in the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia. Her visit to King Solomon highlights her quest for wisdom and truth, which she recognized in Solomon's God-given wisdom. In the context of <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, Jesus uses her as a symbol of those who seek truth and wisdom earnestly. The phrase "rise at the judgment" indicates the final judgment, a common theme in Jewish eschatology, where all generations will be judged. The Queen's condemnation of "this generation" refers to the people of Jesus' time who, despite witnessing His miracles and teachings, failed to recognize Him as the Messiah. Her actions serve as a rebuke to those who have greater revelation in Christ yet remain unrepentant.<p><b>for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,</b><br>The phrase "ends of the earth" emphasizes the great distance the Queen of Sheba traveled, underscoring her determination and the value she placed on wisdom. This journey reflects the ancient world's high regard for Solomon's wisdom, which was renowned far beyond Israel's borders. Her willingness to travel such a distance contrasts with the indifference of Jesus' contemporaries, who had the Messiah in their midst yet did not seek His wisdom. This highlights the theme of seeking truth and the lengths to which one should go to obtain it, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-5</a>, which encourages the pursuit of wisdom.<p><b>and now One greater than Solomon is here.</b><br>This statement asserts Jesus' superiority over Solomon, who was considered the wisest king of Israel. While Solomon's wisdom was a gift from God, Jesus embodies divine wisdom as the incarnate Word of God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This claim of being "greater than Solomon" is a direct assertion of Jesus' divine authority and messianic identity. It also fulfills the prophecy of a coming Messiah who would surpass all previous leaders and kings, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. Jesus' presence and teachings offer a greater revelation than that of Solomon, and His life, death, and resurrection provide the ultimate path to salvation and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_queen_of_the_south.htm">The Queen of the South</a></b><br>This refers to the Queen of Sheba, who traveled a great distance to hear the wisdom of King Solomon.
