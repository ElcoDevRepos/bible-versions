The instruction to "take your pay and go" reflects the landowner's authority and fairness in fulfilling his agreement. In biblical times, daily wages were common, and workers were paid at the end of each day (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). This reflects the immediate provision for daily needs, as seen in the Lord's Prayer, "Give us this day our daily bread" (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). The command to "go" signifies the completion of the agreed-upon work and the fulfillment of the contract, emphasizing the landowner's right to distribute his resources as he sees fit.<p><b>I want to give this last man the same as I gave you.</b><br>This statement highlights the landowner's generosity and the theme of divine grace. The "last man" refers to those hired later in the day, who worked fewer hours but received the same wage. This challenges human notions of fairness and merit, illustrating God's sovereign grace and generosity. The parable reflects the kingdom of heaven, where God's grace is extended equally to all, regardless of their time of service or perceived worthiness. This mirrors the teaching in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God, not based on works. The landowner's desire to give equally underscores the principle that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>), and His grace is not limited by human standards of justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and just in His dealings with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laborers.htm">Laborers</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or followers of Christ, called to work in God's vineyard (the world).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the Kingdom of Heaven, where God's work is done.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/denarius.htm">Denarius</a></b><br>The wage agreed upon, symbolizing the reward of eternal life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/parable_of_the_workers_in_the_vineyard.htm">Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard</a></b><br>An event where Jesus teaches about the Kingdom of Heaven and God's grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_grace.htm">God's Sovereignty and Grace</a></b><br>God, like the landowner, has the right to dispense His grace as He sees fit.

Our calling is to receive the gift with gratitude, rejoice in others&#8217; blessing, and keep moving in humble trust that the Master&#8217;s generosity is perfect justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Take that thine is, and go thy way.</span>--The tone of dismissal is natural and intelligible in the parable. The question, What answers to it in God's dealings with men? is not so easy to answer. If the "penny" which each received was the gift of eternal life, did those who answered to the murmuring labourers receive that, or were they excluded by their discontent from all share in it? Was the money which they received as "fairy-gold" that turned to a withered leaf in the hands of its thankless possessor? The answer is, perhaps, to be found in the thought that that reward lies in the presence of God to the soul of the disciple, and that this depends for its blessedness on the harmony between the character of the believer and the mind of God. Heaven is not a place, but a state, its happiness is not sensual but spiritual, and those who are in it share its blessedness in proportion as they are like God and see Him as He is. It is only perfect when their charity is like His.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take that thine is;</span> <span class="accented">thine own</span>.
