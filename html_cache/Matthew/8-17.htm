The reference to Isaiah highlights the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that Jesus' actions were part of God's redemptive plan. Isaiah was a major prophet whose writings are often seen as messianic, pointing to the coming of a savior. This connection underscores the divine authority and mission of Jesus.<p><b>&#8220;He took up our infirmities</b><br>This part of the verse refers to Jesus' role as a healer and His compassion for human suffering. The term "infirmities" can be understood as physical illnesses or weaknesses, which Jesus addressed through His healing miracles. This action is not only a demonstration of His power but also a fulfillment of the messianic expectation that the Messiah would bring restoration and healing. It reflects the holistic nature of Jesus' ministry, addressing both spiritual and physical needs.<p><b>and carried our diseases.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of carrying diseases suggests a deeper theological significance, pointing to the concept of substitutionary atonement. Just as Jesus physically healed the sick, He also bore the weight of human sin and suffering on the cross. This phrase echoes the Suffering Servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the servant bears the iniquities of others.

We see in Isaiah 53 throughout a picture of our Lord's spiritual work of redemption, and the words quoted are almost the cardinal text for the special view of the atonement, which sees in the sufferings of Christ the freely accepted penalty that was due for the transgressions of mankind. The Evangelist, with the memory of that evening present to his mind, saw them fulfilled in this removal of the "infirmities" and "sicknesses" that oppressed the bodies of men. It was not merely that He came, as one of boundless wealth, who might scatter alms broadcast, but that He Himself "took" and "bore" the sufferings which He removed. He suffered with those He saw suffer. The power to heal was intimately connected with the intensity of His sympathy, and so was followed (as analogous works of love are followed in those who are most Christ-like in their lives) by weariness and physical exhaustion. What is related by St. Mark and St. Luke of our Lord's seeking out the refuge of solitude at the earliest dawn of the day that followed, is entirely in harmony with the view thus suggested.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Matthew only.

St. Matthew in this verse calls attention to two points. First, that prophecy had foretold that Christ would heal the sick. For this he might have adduced <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5, 6</a>, and similar passages; but as one verse will serve his double purpose, he prefers it. Secondly, that the method by which Christ did this was specially noteworthy. He did not perform miracles by magic (as is commonly asserted of him in the Talmud; cf. Laible, 'Jesus Christ in Talmud,' p. 44: Berlin, 1891),nor by the power of God exerted as it were externally on his behalf, nor by his own inherent Divine power, but by himself bearing the sicknesses that he removed. He wrought his miracles at his own expense,and that expense the greatest. The thought is far-reaching, and implies both that he bore the ultimate cause of sickness, the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), and also that each miracle of healing meant for him a fresh realization of what bearing the sin of the world included. In other words, the passage in Isaiah, as interpreted by St. Matthew, refers, not only to the Passion as such, but also to Christ's suffering an earnest and a foretaste of it at each miracle. May not this have been in part the cause of his sigh at one miracle (<a href="/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34</a>), and his deep emotion at another (<a href="/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>)? Observe that this may be the complementary side of his experience recorded in <a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a> (parallel passage: <a href="/luke/8-46.htm">Luke 8:46</a>), that "power" went out of him. A miracle of healing, though performed in momentary unconsciousness of what was taking place, still necessitated personal contact with sin, which to Christ's whole nature meant moral effort. The utterance recorded by Origen, "For those that are sick! was sick, and' for those that hunger I suffered hunger, and for those that thirst I suffered thirst" (Bishop Westcott, 'Introd.,' Appendix C; Resch, 'Agmpha,' Log. 47), probably expresses the same thought as our verse, though in the language of <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35, 36</a>. A similar idea seems to underlie the well-known saying of Talm. Bab., 'Sanh.,' 98b, with reference to Messiah, "The Leper of the house of Rabbi is his name; for it is said, 'Surely he hath berne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.'"
