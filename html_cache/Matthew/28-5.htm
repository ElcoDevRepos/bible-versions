Angels are messengers of God, and their presence here underscores the significance of the resurrection event. The women mentioned are likely Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, who had come to see the tomb. In the cultural context of the time, women were not considered reliable witnesses, yet the Gospels highlight their role, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel message.<p><b>Do not be afraid</b><br>This phrase is a common reassurance given by angels in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a> and <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>. Fear is a natural human response to the supernatural, and the angel's words are meant to calm and prepare the women for the revelation of the resurrection. The command not to fear also reflects the transformative power of the resurrection, which conquers fear and death.<p><b>for I know that you are looking for Jesus</b><br>The angel acknowledges the purpose of the women's visit, showing divine awareness of human actions and intentions. This phrase highlights the devotion and love the women had for Jesus, as they sought Him even after His death. It also sets the stage for the revelation that Jesus is no longer in the tomb, pointing to the fulfillment of His promise to rise again.<p><b>who was crucified</b><br>This reference to the crucifixion is crucial, as it affirms the historical reality of Jesus' death. The crucifixion was a well-documented Roman method of execution, and its mention here underscores the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus. It also connects to Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretold the suffering of the Messiah. The crucifixion is central to Christian theology, as it represents the atonement for sin and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to deliver the good news of Jesus' resurrection.

Doubtless innumerable angels were thronging around, and one or more became visible to certain persons as they were capable of receiving spiritual impressions, or as these spirits were directed to show themselves.
