Confession of sins was a public acknowledgment of wrongdoing and a desire for spiritual renewal. In the Jewish tradition, confession was often associated with the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29-30</a>) and other penitential practices. The act of confessing sins before baptism signifies a turning away from past transgressions and a commitment to a new way of life. This practice is echoed in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, which emphasizes the importance of confession for forgiveness and cleansing.<p><b>They were baptized by him</b><br>Baptism, as performed by John, was a symbolic act of purification and repentance. It was not yet the Christian baptism instituted by Jesus, which includes the Holy Spirit (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). John's baptism was preparatory, pointing towards the coming of the Messiah and the need for spiritual readiness. The act of baptism by immersion in water symbolized the washing away of sins and a fresh start. This practice has roots in Jewish purification rituals, such as the mikveh, which involved immersion for ritual cleanliness.<p><b>In the Jordan River</b><br>The Jordan River holds significant historical and theological importance in the Bible. It was the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>), symbolizing a transition from the old life of slavery in Egypt to a new life in the land God promised. By baptizing in the Jordan, John the Baptist was connecting his ministry to this rich history of deliverance and new beginnings. The Jordan River also serves as a geographical marker, separating the wilderness from the land of Israel, symbolizing the transition from a life of sin to one of righteousness. This location foreshadows Jesus' own baptism in the Jordan, marking the beginning of His public ministry (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophetic figure who preached repentance and baptized people in preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ.

This was more than a casual acknowledgment; it was an open, personal owning of wrongdoing. <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a> models the heart behind it: &#8220;Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity.&#8221; Confession showed true repentance, echoing <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>, where God promises, &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; Their words matched an inner turning, preparing them to receive the coming Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were baptized</b><p>John&#8217;s baptism was an outward sign of that inward repentance. It symbolized cleansing and a decisive break with the old life, similar to how Israel once crossed the Red Sea, leaving Egypt behind (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>). <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a> shows the same pattern&#8212;repentance paired with baptism&#8212;carrying forward into the church age. Baptism doesn&#8217;t save by itself (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), but it openly identifies the repentant with God&#8217;s redemptive work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by him</b><p>John was the God-appointed forerunner (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>), commissioned to &#8220;prepare the way for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>). Being baptized &#8220;by him&#8221; meant submitting to the message God had entrusted to John. Obedience to God-sent messengers often precedes deeper revelation; compare Cornelius listening to Peter in <a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. Accepting John&#8217;s ministry positioned the people to recognize and receive Jesus when He appeared (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Jordan River</b><p>The Jordan held rich covenant history: it was where Israel entered the Promised Land (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3-4</a>) and where Elijah and Elisha crossed before Elijah&#8217;s ascent (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8-14</a>). By returning to this river, God called His people to re-enter covenant faithfulness. The setting underscored a fresh start, anticipating Jesus&#8217; own baptism there (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>), where the Father publicly affirmed His Son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a> shows repentance in action: honest confession, public baptism, submission to God&#8217;s messenger, and a setting that evokes covenant renewal.
