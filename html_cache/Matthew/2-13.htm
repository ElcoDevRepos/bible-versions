Their visit fulfills the prophecy of Gentiles coming to the light of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>). The Magi's departure signifies a transition from revelation to action, as their visit indirectly triggers Herod's wrath.<p><b>an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream</b><br>Angelic appearances in dreams are a recurring theme in the nativity narrative, emphasizing divine guidance and intervention. Joseph's dreams parallel those of the Old Testament Joseph, who also received divine messages through dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>). This method of communication underscores the importance of obedience to God's will.<p><b>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; he said</b><br>The urgency in the angel's command reflects the imminent danger posed by Herod. The imperative "Get up!" indicates immediate action is required, highlighting the seriousness of the situation and the need for prompt obedience.<p><b>&#8220;Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt</b><br>Egypt serves as a place of refuge, historically a land of asylum for those fleeing danger (<a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). This journey echoes the story of the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt, drawing a parallel between Jesus and Moses, both of whom were preserved from a tyrannical ruler. Egypt's proximity and large Jewish population made it a logical refuge.<p><b>Stay there until I tell you</b><br>This instruction emphasizes reliance on divine timing and guidance. Joseph is to remain in Egypt until further notice, demonstrating trust in God's plan and timing. This period of waiting reflects the broader biblical theme of patience and faith in God's promises.<p><b>for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him</b><br>Herod's intent to kill Jesus highlights the threat posed by earthly powers to the divine plan. Herod's actions fulfill the prophecy of opposition to the Messiah (<a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>). This foreshadows the ongoing conflict between the kingdom of God and worldly authorities, a theme that continues throughout Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The earthly father of Jesus, known for his righteousness and obedience to God's commands.
