While Jesus is often associated with peace, this statement highlights the division that can occur as a result of His message. The Greek word used here for "turn" can also mean to set at variance or to separate, suggesting a deliberate action that results in division. This reflects the reality that the gospel can create conflict even within close relationships, as individuals respond differently to Jesus' call.<p><b>a man against his father,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the potential for division within the most fundamental social unit: the family. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, family loyalty was paramount. The idea of a son being set against his father would have been shocking. This division is not the goal but a consequence of the radical nature of Jesus' teachings, which demand ultimate allegiance to Him above all else. This echoes <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, where familial discord is a sign of societal breakdown, highlighting the cost of discipleship.<p><b>a daughter against her mother,</b><br>The mention of a daughter against her mother continues the theme of familial division. In ancient Jewish culture, the mother-daughter relationship was crucial for the transmission of cultural and religious values. Jesus' message challenges these traditional bonds, illustrating that following Him may require prioritizing spiritual kinship over biological ties. This reflects the transformative and sometimes disruptive power of the gospel.<p><b>a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</b><br>The inclusion of the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law relationship further underscores the pervasive nature of the division Jesus speaks of. In many cultures, including the Jewish culture of the time, this relationship could already be fraught with tension. Jesus' message intensifies this potential conflict, as allegiance to Him may lead to differing values and priorities within extended family structures. This highlights the comprehensive impact of Jesus' call to discipleship, affecting all areas of life and relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, preparing them for the challenges they will face as His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>The verse specifically mentions familial relationships&#8212;father, mother, daughter, and daughter-in-law&#8212;highlighting the potential for division within the closest human relationships.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mission_of_jesus.htm">Mission of Jesus</a></b><br>The broader context of Jesus' mission on earth, which includes bringing truth and salvation, even if it causes division.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context.htm">Cultural Context</a></b><br>The Jewish cultural setting where family ties were of utmost importance, making the statement particularly striking.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to division, even within families.

His coming forces a choice of ultimate loyalty.<p>&#8226; Cross references show the same truth: <a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51&#8211;53</a> speaks of households divided; <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> reminds that loving father or mother more than Christ makes one &#8220;unworthy&#8221; of Him.<p>&#8226; Scripture still commands honor for parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1&#8211;3</a>). The clash arises not because Christ cancels that command, but because some fathers will reject the gospel while their sons embrace it.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s words are literal: following Him can sever even the tightest earthly bond. Yet the intent is not to encourage rebellion; it exposes the unavoidable conflict between allegiance to Christ and allegiance to unbelief (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a daughter against her mother</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;A daughter against her mother&#8221; pictures the intimate mother-daughter relationship fractured when one side rejects Christ.<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>&#8212;quoted by Jesus here&#8212;portrays end-times corruption when family ties fail; Christ applies it to His own ministry.<p>&#8226; The gospel does not discriminate by age or gender; every heart must decide (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience to Christ might mean a daughter respectfully refusing to join her mother in unbelieving practices (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>). The division is moral and spiritual, not malicious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law</b><p>&#8226; Jesus continues: &#8220;a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.&#8221; He presses the illustration to the extended family, highlighting that no household tier is exempt.<p>&#8226; In ancient Israel, a daughter-in-law often lived under her husband&#8217;s family roof; such close quarters make spiritual disagreement especially sharp (<a href="/ruth/1-15.htm">Ruth 1:15-18</a> shows a positive example, but here Jesus gives the opposite).<p>&#8226; First Peter 3:1-2 encourages believing wives to win unbelieving husbands &#8220;without a word,&#8221; yet notes possible suffering (<a href="/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14-17</a>). The same dynamic applies to in-law relationships.<p>&#8226; Again, Christ predicts division, He does not prescribe hostility. <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a> calls believers to live at peace &#8220;if it is possible.&#8221; Sometimes it is not possible because loyalty to Christ is non-negotiable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35</a> teaches that Jesus&#8217; coming inevitably exposes who stands with Him and who does not. When family members part ways over that choice, even the closest relationships can fracture. Honor, love, and peacemaking remain Christian duties, yet they never outrank allegiance to the Lord. Christ tells the truth in advance so His followers will not be shaken when loyalty to Him costs them the comfort of unanimous family support.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) The words are partly, as the marginal reference shows, an echo of <a href="/micah/7-6.htm" title="For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.">Micah 7:6</a>, but the selection of the special relationships as typical instances suggests the thought of some personal application. Had Zebedee looked with displeasure on the calling of his two sons? or was there variance between the daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law in the household of Peter? Were the brethren of the Lord, who as yet believed not, as the foes of a man's own household?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/12-53.htm">Luke 12:53</a> (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_word">For I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am come;</span> <span class="accented">I came</span> (Revised Version).
