Receiving a prophet implies acknowledging their divine commission and message. This phrase emphasizes the importance of recognizing and honoring those who speak on behalf of God. In the Old Testament, prophets like Elijah and Elisha were often received with hospitality, which brought blessings to their hosts (<a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8-24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8-37</a>). The act of receiving a prophet is an acknowledgment of God's authority and message.<p><b>will receive a prophet&#8217;s reward</b><br>The reward for receiving a prophet is not necessarily material but spiritual. It signifies sharing in the blessings and benefits of the prophet's ministry. In <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8-17</a>, the Shunammite woman who provided for Elisha was blessed with a son. This reward can also be seen as participating in the prophet's mission and the fulfillment of God's promises. The concept of reward is consistent with the biblical principle that God honors those who honor His servants (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p><b>and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man</b><br>A righteous man in biblical terms is someone who lives according to God's laws and principles. Receiving such a person means recognizing and supporting their commitment to righteousness. This phrase highlights the value of community and fellowship among believers, as seen in the early church where believers supported one another (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>). It underscores the importance of encouraging and sustaining those who live by God's standards.<p><b>will receive a righteous man&#8217;s reward</b><br>The reward for receiving a righteous man is akin to the blessings that come from supporting and being in fellowship with those who pursue godliness. This reward may manifest in spiritual growth, mutual encouragement, and shared joy in the faith. The principle is echoed in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, where Jesus teaches that acts of kindness to His followers are acts of kindness to Him. The reward is both present, in the form of spiritual enrichment, and future, in the eternal blessings promised to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instructions to His disciples as He sends them out to preach the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who are called by God to deliver His messages to the people.

Receiving God&#8217;s messenger is receiving God Himself (cf. <a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>), underscoring the sacredness of such welcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he is a prophet</b><p>Motivation matters. The blessing promised here is tied to recognizing the God-given role of the prophet, not merely offering generic kindness. Similar heart-level discernment appears in <a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a> where Lydia urges Paul, &#8220;If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house.&#8221; She served him precisely because he was Christ&#8217;s apostle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will receive a prophet&#8217;s reward</b><p>God shares the fruit of the prophet&#8217;s labor with the one who stands behind him. Elijah&#8217;s hostess saw her flour and oil miraculously multiplied; later her son was raised to life (<a href="/1_kings/17-15.htm">1 Kings 17:15-23</a>). Paul says partners in ministry become &#8220;fellow workers for the truth&#8221; (3 <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>) and promises that the spiritual crop will be &#8220;credited to your account&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and whoever receives a righteous man</b><p>Beyond official prophets, every faithful believer (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>) embodies righteousness by walking in God&#8217;s ways. Welcoming such disciples echoes the shepherd-goat scene where Christ commends those who cared for &#8220;the least of these brothers of Mine&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he is a righteous man</b><p>The kindness here springs from love for Christ manifest in His people (<a href="/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>).

The reward may appear now&#8212;like Obed-edom&#8217;s household blessed for housing the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>)&#8212;and will certainly be unveiled in eternity (<a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus assures us that welcoming God&#8217;s messengers and God&#8217;s people links us to their mission and to their blessing.

The distinction between the two involves the higher inspiration of the prophet as a messenger of God, and perhaps implies that that inspiration belonged to some, and not to all the Twelve, while those who were not to receive that special gift were at all events called to set forth the pattern of a righteous life. The "reward," and the time of its being received, belong to the future glory of the kingdom; and the words of the promise throw the gate wide open, so as to admit not only those whose gifts and characters command the admiration of mankind, but all those who show in action that they are in sympathy with the work for which the gifts have been bestowed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Matthew only. The whole verso recalls Jewish Christianity; it was hardly likely to have been remembered outside Jewish Christian circles. <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth a prophet</span>. One upon whom the mantle of the old prophets might in any sense he said to have fallen. The saying was probably <span class="accented">recorded</span> with special thought of the Christian peripatetic "prophets," who are brought before us so vividly in the 'Didache.' <span class="cmt_word">In the name of a prophet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). In late Hebrew and in Aramaic the word for "name" passed into little more than a preposition, just as the word for "face "had already passed (and so the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>). Here, however, this is hardly the case, the word appearing to retain its idea of both name and corresponding position. The preposition may mean <span class="accented">either</span> receive him into the position of a prophet, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into the treatment with which a prophet should be received; <span class="accented">or</span>, simply, receive him at the rank and standing of a prophet (<a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>). Anyhow, it is in contrast to receiving him out of mere human compassion or ordinary friendliness. The reception is to have regard to that which the name implies, for the sake of the cause that the prophet represents. <span class="cmt_word">Shall receive a prophet's reward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall share in the reward of that work in which by his kindness to the prophet he so tar takes part. Thus the widow of Sarepta shared in the blessing given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; cf. also <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). (On <span class="accented">reward</span>, see <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>, note.) Observe that not the action, but the motive for the action, is made all-important. It is a matter of faith, not of works (cf Nosgen). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">he that receiveth a righteous man</span>. <span class="accented">A righteous man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who is punctilious in performing all the details of the revealed will of God (<a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>, note; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>; <a href="/james/5-6.htm">James 5:6</a>). This word also is used in a quasi-Jewish sense, and points back to the time when Jewish Christians performed, not only the law as expounded in the sermon on the mount, but also those external rites and observances which had been commanded them as Jews (<a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>). Among such Jewish Christians some would he especially noticeable for their regard to these things (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> James the "Just," or "Righteous"), and it is to one of these that the epithet here refers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/10-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
