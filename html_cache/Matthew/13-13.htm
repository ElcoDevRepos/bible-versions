Parables are simple stories used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson. In the context of <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, Jesus is addressing the crowds and His disciples, explaining why He chooses this method. Parables serve a dual purpose: they reveal truths to those who are spiritually receptive while concealing them from those who are not. This approach fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah, highlighting the spiritual blindness and deafness of the people. Parables also reflect the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, where stories and proverbs are used to impart wisdom.<p><b>&#8216;Though seeing, they do not see;</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual blindness of the people. Despite witnessing Jesus' miracles and hearing His teachings, many failed to recognize Him as the Messiah. This blindness is not due to a lack of evidence but a hardness of heart. The concept of seeing but not perceiving is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet Isaiah is told that the people will hear but not understand, see but not perceive. This spiritual condition is a result of their unwillingness to accept the truth, a theme that runs throughout the Bible, emphasizing the need for spiritual discernment.<p><b>though hearing, they do not hear or understand.&#8217;</b><br>Here, the emphasis is on the inability to comprehend the message of Jesus despite hearing it. This reflects a deeper spiritual deafness, where the words of Jesus do not penetrate the heart. In the cultural context of the time, hearing was not just about auditory reception but involved obedience and understanding. The failure to hear and understand is a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah and is indicative of a broader spiritual condition that Jesus addresses throughout His ministry. This phrase also connects to <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes from hearing the message of Christ, underscoring the importance of not just hearing but truly understanding and accepting the Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowds and His disciples using parables.

The crowd&#8217;s problem was not sensory deprivation but spiritual obstinacy foretold by Isaiah. Jesus&#8217; words confront every listener with a choice: humble faith that receives and understands, or hardened unbelief that sees and hears yet remains blind and deaf.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Because they seeing see not.</span>--As the words stand in St. Matthew, they might mean that our Lord adopted the method of parables as a condescension to their infirmities, feeding them, as babes in knowledge, with milk, and not with meat. In St. Mark and St. Luke the reason given assumes a penal character, "that seeing they might not see;" as though they were not only to be left in their ignorance, but to be plunged deeper in it. And this, it is obvious, is even here the true meaning, for only thus does this clause answer to the conclusion of the proverb of <a href="/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>, "From him shall be taken away even that which he hath." In one aspect, then, the parable was a veil hiding the truth from them, because they did not seek the truth, and this was the working of the divine law of retribution. But even here we may venture to trace beneath the penalty an element of mercy. The parable could, at all events, do men no harm. It could not rouse the fierce enmity that had been kindled by truth spoken in its plainness. And it might prepare the way, might set men thinking and questioning, and if so, that was at least one step towards the "having," though it were but a very little, which might place them among those to whom more shall be given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). To carry out the principle of the whole preceding verse, but with special reference to the second half of it. Because, in this case, they "have not," <span class="accented">therefore</span> I speak to them thus. <span class="cmt_word">Speak I to them in parables because.</span> In the parallel passages Christ says that he speaks in parables "<span class="accented">in order that</span> seeing," etc.; but here, "<span class="accented">because</span> seeing," etc. The difference of the thought, which is more formal than real, is that <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the parallel passages their moral blindness and deafness are represented as the <span class="accented">effect</span> of what he says, parables being used <span class="accented">to bring about</span> the punishment for what was presumably earlier sloth (thus laying stress on the idea of "shall be taken away "in our ver. 12; cf. "that they which see not may be made blind," <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; and Bishop Westcott's note). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In Matthew their present moral blindness and deafness are represented as the <span class="accented">reason</span> for the use of parables. Parables are themselves the punishment; the people are fit for nothing else (thus laying stress on the "has not" of ver. 12); therefore Christ speaks to them in parables. <span class="cmt_word">They seeing see not</span> (<span class="accented">seeing they see not</span>, Revised Version, keeping the order of the Greek, as even the Authorized Version in the next clause); <span class="cmt_word">and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand</span>. The participles "seeing," "hearing," in Matthew and Luke, probably do <span class="accented">not</span> represent the Hebrew infinitive in its common usage of giving intensity or continuance to the idea of the finite verb to which it is joined (so in the original passage of Isaiah, and perhaps in Mark; compare also "seeing" in the next verse), but are to be taken separately, <span class="accented">i.e."</span> Though they have powers of seeing and of hearing, they nevertheless do not so use these powers as to see and hear" (for the thought, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>). Thus in meaning, though not in form, as compared with the next verse, <span class="accented">seeing</span> is equivalent to "seeing ye shall see;" <span class="accented">they see not</span>, to "and shall in no wise perceive;" <span class="accented">hearing</span>, to "hearing ye shall hear;" <span class="accented">they hear not</span>, to "and shall in no wise understand." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I speak</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#8182;</span> <span class="translit">(lal&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
