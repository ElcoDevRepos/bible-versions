In the context of <a href="/matthew/19.htm">Matthew 19</a>, Jesus has just spoken about the permanence of marriage and the call to celibacy for the sake of the kingdom. The "word" refers to these teachings, which were counter-cultural in a Jewish society that valued marriage and procreation. This echoes the idea found in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where spiritual truths are discerned only by those who are spiritually mature.<p><b>He replied,</b><br>Jesus' response is direct and authoritative, indicating His role as a teacher and prophet. His reply comes after the disciples express surprise at His teaching on marriage, showing that even those closest to Him struggled with His radical ideas. This reflects the broader theme in the Gospels of Jesus challenging societal norms and expectations.<p><b>but only those to whom it has been given.</b><br>This phrase suggests that understanding and accepting Jesus' teachings is a gift from God, aligning with the concept of divine revelation. It implies that spiritual insight is not achieved through human effort alone but is granted by God. This is consistent with passages like <a href="/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a>, where Jesus states that no one can come to Him unless it is granted by the Father.

He immediately adds, &#8220;Not everyone can accept this word.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The statement acknowledges that His teaching runs against human instinct and cultural norms&#8212;just as many disciples once said, &#8220;This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-60.htm">John 6:60</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture affirms that the &#8220;natural man does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>); apart from divine help, people resist truths that confront their desires.<p>&#8226; Hard hearts (<a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>) and worldly pressures make both Jesus&#8217; view of marriage and the call to celibacy appear impractical or even impossible.<p>&#8226; Yet the very fact that some do receive it proves the word itself is not too hard; the issue lies with human unwillingness (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He replied</b><p>By inserting this brief phrase, the text reminds us that the authority behind the teaching is Jesus Himself.<p>&#8226; Earlier crowds &#8220;were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>; <a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; His reply is not mere opinion; it is the Lord&#8217;s interpretation of God&#8217;s revealed will, the same voice that stilled storms and forgave sins (<a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>; 9:6).<p>&#8226; When He speaks, the sheep recognize His voice (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Accepting or rejecting the word is ultimately a response to Him personally, not just to an ethical standard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but only those to whom it has been given</b><p>The capacity to embrace Jesus&#8217; hard saying is a gift.<p>&#8226; Jesus told the Twelve, &#8220;The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; cf. <a href="/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>).<p>&#8226; He later said, &#8220;No one can come to Me unless it is granted him by the Father&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a>). Divine grace enables both faith and obedience.<p>&#8226; Paul echoes this: &#8220;Each has his own gift from God, one this, another that&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>). The call to lifelong marriage, or to celibate kingdom service, is bestowed along with the necessary grace to live it.<p>&#8226; Salvation itself is &#8220;by grace &#8230; through faith&#8212;and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>), and believing is &#8220;granted&#8221; to us (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, those who accept Jesus&#8217; words do so because the Father opens their hearts (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>). Our response is real and responsible, yet it rests on prior divine enabling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/19-11.htm">Matthew 19:11</a> teaches that Christ&#8217;s high view of marriage and the costly call to celibacy can only be received by hearts God has prepared. Human nature resists, but divine grace grants sight, faith, and strength. Jesus speaks with absolute authority, and those to whom the Father gives understanding joyfully embrace His word and live it out, confident that the Giver supplies all that He commands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">All men cannot receive this saying.</span>--As the words stand, "this saying" might refer either to the rule which our Lord had laid down on the subject of divorce, or to the comment of the disciples on that rule. What follows, however, determines the reference to the latter. Looking at marriage from a simply selfish point of view, and therefore with an entirely inadequate estimate of its duties on the one hand, and on the other of the temptations incident to the unmarried life when chosen on such grounds, they had come rashly to the conclusion that, if our Lord's rule held good, it was not good, not expedient, to "marry." He declares that judgment to be false. There were but few who were capable of acting safely on that conclusion. For those who were not so capable, and the next verse tells us who they were, marriage, with all its risks, was the truer, healthier, safer state. Alike in its brighter or sadder sides, in seeming success or seeming failure, it brought to men the discipline they needed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Our Lord makes a gentle reply to this observation of the disciples concerning the inexpediency of marriage under some circumstances.

But he endorses these words in a different signification from theirs. Their objection to marry arose from the impossibility of putting away a wife for any cause.
