This act signifies Jesus' authority as a teacher and His role as the ultimate Rabbi. It also indicates a formal teaching moment, inviting His listeners to pay close attention to His words.<p><b>His disciples came to Him</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between the general crowd and those who were committed followers of Jesus. The disciples' approach signifies their readiness to learn and receive deeper spiritual truths. It also reflects the pattern of discipleship, where followers actively seek the presence and wisdom of their teacher.

Few will fail to recognise the fitness of its position, and the influence which it has exercised wherever the Gospel record has found its way. More than any other part of that record did it impress itself on the minds of men in the first age of the Church, and more often is it quoted by the writers of that period--St. James, and Barnabas, and Clement of Rome, and Ignatius, and Polycarp. More than any other portion, in recent time, has it attracted the admiring reverence even of many who did not look on the Preacher of the Sermon as the faith of Christendom looks on Him. Not unfrequently its teaching, as being purely ethical, has been contrasted with the more dogmatic character of the discourses that appear in St. John. How far that contrast really exists will appear as we interpret it. Two preliminary questions, however, present themselves: (1) Have we here the actual verbatim report of one single discourse? (2) Is that discourse the same as that which we find in <a href="/context/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20-49</a>, and which, for the sake of distinctness, we may call the Sermon on the Plain? Following the method hitherto adopted in dealing with problems which rise from the comparison of one Gospel with another, the latter inquiry will be postponed till we have to meet it in writing on St. Luke's Gospel. Here it will be enough to state the conclusion which seems to be most probable, that the two discourses are quite distinct, and that each has traceably a purpose and method of its own. The other question calls for discussion now.<p>At first sight there is much that favours the belief that the Sermon on the Mount is, as it were, a pattern discourse, framed out of the fragments of many like discourses. Not only is there a large element common to it and to the Sermon on the Plain, but we find many other portions of it scattered here and there in other parts of St. Luke's Gospel. Thus we have:--<p>-1<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a><p>. . .<p><a href="/luke/14-34.htm" title="Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be seasoned?">Luke 14:34</a><p>-2<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm" title="For truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one stroke or one pronunciation mark shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.">Matthew 5:18</a> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And seeing the multitudes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those spoken of in <a href="/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a> - the multitudes who were at that point of time following him. <span class="cmt_word">He went up</span>.

The actual spot here referred to may have been far from, or, and more probably (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18</a>), near to, the Lake of Gennesareth. It cannot now be identified.

Lects.,' p. 178), especially for the reasons that <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to "the mountain" as a distinct name, and this mountain alone, with the exception of Tabor which is too distant, stands separate from the uniform barrier of hills round the lake; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the platform at the top is evidently suitable for the collection of a multitude, and corresponds precisely to the 'level place' (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>) to which our Lord would 'come down,' as from one of its higher horns, to address the people."
