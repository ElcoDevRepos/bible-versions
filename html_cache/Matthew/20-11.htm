The context is a vineyard owner who hires workers at different times of the day but pays them all the same wage. The payment symbolizes the grace of God, which is given equally to all believers, regardless of when they come to faith. This reflects the kingdom of heaven's values, where God's generosity surpasses human notions of fairness. The vineyard is a common biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), and the payment can be seen as the reward of eternal life.<p><b>they began to grumble</b><br>Grumbling here indicates dissatisfaction and a sense of injustice among the workers who labored longer. This mirrors the human tendency to compare oneself with others and feel entitled to more based on effort or time. Biblically, grumbling is often associated with a lack of faith or trust in God's provision, as seen in the Israelites' complaints in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). This attitude contrasts with the call to rejoice in others' blessings and trust in God's equitable justice.<p><b>against the landowner</b><br>The landowner represents God, who is sovereign and just in His dealings. The workers' grumbling against him highlights a misunderstanding of God's grace and generosity. In the cultural context, a landowner had the right to manage his resources as he saw fit, reflecting God's authority over His creation. This part of the parable challenges the audience to trust in God's wisdom and fairness, even when it defies human expectations. The landowner's actions echo the biblical theme that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_landowner.htm">The Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God in the parable, who is just and sovereign in His dealings with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_laborers.htm">The Laborers</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or followers of Christ, each called to work in God's vineyard (the world).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the Kingdom of Heaven, where God's work is to be done.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_payment.htm">The Payment</a></b><br>Symbolizes the rewards or blessings given by God, which are based on His grace rather than human merit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grumbling.htm">The Grumbling</a></b><br>Reflects human dissatisfaction and envy, highlighting a lack of understanding of God's grace and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_grace.htm">Understanding God's Grace</a></b><br>God's grace is not earned by human effort but is a gift given according to His will.

Comparison blinds us to grace (<a href="/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22</a>, &#8220;What is that to you? You must follow Me,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a> calls believers to &#8220;Do everything without complaining or arguing,&#8221; showing that gratitude is the antidote to grumbling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the landowner</b><p>&#8226; Their complaint is directed at the very one who offered them work and kept his promise&#8212;symbolic of how sinners aim their accusations at God despite His generosity (<a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>).<p>&#8226; In the parable, the landowner represents the Lord who bestows grace as He wills (<a href="/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>, &#8220;Do I not have the right to do as I please with what is mine?&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Grumbling &#8220;against&#8221; authority echoes Israel&#8217;s wilderness pattern: &#8220;You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a> warns, &#8220;Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged,&#8221; reminding us that complaint invites divine scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/20-11.htm">Matthew 20:11</a> exposes the human tendency to trade thankfulness for jealousy the moment God&#8217;s generosity toward others surpasses our expectations.
