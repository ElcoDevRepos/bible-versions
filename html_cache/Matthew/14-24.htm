The phrase indicates they were a significant distance from the shore, emphasizing their vulnerability and isolation. This setting underscores the disciples' dependence on Jesus, who was not physically present with them at this moment. The Sea of Galilee is about 13 miles long and 8 miles wide, and being far from land would mean they were likely in the middle of the lake, away from immediate help.<p><b>buffeted by the waves</b><br>The term "buffeted" suggests a violent and continuous assault by the waves, indicating a severe storm. This imagery is consistent with the unpredictable weather patterns of the Sea of Galilee, where winds can funnel through the surrounding hills, creating sudden and fierce storms. The disciples, many of whom were experienced fishermen, would have been familiar with such conditions, yet the severity of this storm was enough to cause fear and distress.<p><b>because the wind was against it</b><br>The wind being "against" the boat highlights the struggle and opposition the disciples faced. In biblical symbolism, wind often represents challenges or trials. This scenario can be seen as a test of faith, where the disciples must rely on their trust in Jesus despite the adverse conditions. The wind's opposition also serves as a metaphor for spiritual opposition, where believers may face resistance in their journey of faith. This scene foreshadows the coming of Jesus, who will demonstrate His authority over nature, reinforcing His divine identity and the disciples' need to trust in His power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were in the boat, experiencing the storm.
