The name Jacob connects to the patriarch Jacob, father of the twelve tribes of Israel, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant promises. This genealogy, though tracing Joseph's lineage, underscores the legal right of Jesus to the throne of David through his earthly father.<p><b>the husband of Mary</b><br>Mary's role is highlighted as the mother of Jesus, emphasizing her unique position in salvation history. The term "husband" indicates Joseph's legal and protective role, though not the biological father of Jesus. This reflects the cultural context of betrothal and marriage in Jewish society, where Joseph's acceptance of Mary despite her miraculous pregnancy demonstrates his righteousness and obedience to God's will (<a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19-24</a>).<p><b>of whom was born Jesus</b><br>The phrase "of whom" is feminine in Greek, indicating that Jesus was born of Mary alone, affirming the doctrine of the virgin birth. This miraculous event fulfills <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which prophesies a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel. The birth of Jesus marks the incarnation of God, a central tenet of Christian faith, where God takes on human flesh to redeem humanity.<p><b>who is called Christ</b><br>The title "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This designation identifies Jesus as the long-awaited deliverer and king prophesied throughout the Old Testament. It connects to numerous messianic prophecies, such as those in Psalms and Isaiah, and establishes Jesus' divine mission to bring salvation to all people. The use of "called" indicates recognition of Jesus' messianic role by his followers and the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The father of Joseph, part of the genealogy of Jesus, linking Jesus to the line of David and Abraham, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's lineage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The husband of Mary, who played a crucial role in the earthly life of Jesus, providing a legal lineage to David, which was significant for Jewish understanding of the Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, chosen by God to bear His Son, highlighting her role in the divine plan of salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose birth is the culmination of God's redemptive plan, fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>A title meaning "Anointed One," signifying Jesus as the promised Messiah, the Savior of the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_genealogy.htm">The Importance of Genealogy</a></b><br>Understanding Jesus' genealogy helps us see the fulfillment of God's promises and the continuity of His redemptive plan throughout history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_joseph_and_mary.htm">Role of Joseph and Mary</a></b><br>Joseph and Mary were chosen for their faithfulness and obedience.

Together they declare that Jesus rightly, miraculously, and prophetically fulfills every expectation of Scripture as the Savior-King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary</span>. St. Luke calls Joseph "the son of Heli." There are two ways in which these differing statements may be made to accord. The two sons of Matthan were Jacob the elder, and Heli the younger. It may be that Mary was the only child of Jacob, and Joseph the son of Heli. Then by marriage with his cousin, Joseph would become Jacob's son as well as Heli's. Or it may be that Jacob died without children, and Heli, marrying his widow according to the Jewish usage, became by her the father of Joseph, who hence would be called Jacob's son, that the elder brother's line might not die out. The points noticed above in respect of these varying pedigrees seem to be all those on which anything needs to be said with the view of comparing them. Their variety stands as a constant evidence of the independence of the two evangelists. Had either of them been conscious of the existence of the other's work. it is inconceivable that he would have made no effort to adjust the pedigree, for which he would possess means now lost for ever. They both design to give us the descent of Joseph from David, this being what a Sew would most regard. The descent of Mary from David is nowhere definitely mentioned in the Gospels, but that Jesus was sprung from David on the mother's side too we are warranted in concluding from the words of the angel to Mary (Luke 1:82), "his father David" (cf. also Delitzsch, 'Hess. Proph.,' &sect; 17). But though we ought not to spend vain labour in attempting to reconcile these two genealogies of Joseph, we can see, from what we know of Jewish customs, grounds enough for understanding how these variations came to exist. The same Jew, we find, was often known under two names; of this we have several examples in the lists of the twelve apostles. It is possible, therefore, that in these two pedigrees there may have been more points of union than we are able to detect. Then the rule, before alluded to, by which a man took the childless widow of his deceased brother for his wife and raised seed unto his brother, may also have led to much confusion of names, which we have now no means of unravelling. The evangelists drew each his own list from some authentic source, accessible to others beside themselves, and the record of which could be verified when the Gospels were set forth. This should satisfy us that those we have received were held by the Jews soon after Christ's time to be truthful records, and that each established from a Jewish point of view the descent of the putative father of Jesus from King David. <span class="cmt_word">Of whom was born Jesus</span>. This name, which, through <span class="accented">Jeshua</span>, is the Greek form <span class="accented">of Joshua</span> (for which, indeed, it stands in the Authorized Version of <a href="/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a> and <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>), signifies "Jehovah is help," and was not an uncommon name among the Jews, though given with marked significance at this time (see ver. 21). We find, according to the best texts, that in <a href="/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> this name occurs in the pedigree of Joseph (where the Authorized Version has Jose), and the Revised Version has adopted that reading. (Of the way in which the name was augmented when given to the famous successor of Moses, see <a href="/numbers/13-16.htm">Numbers 13:16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Who is called Christ</span>. The evangelist here alludes merely to the well-known fact that Jesus was called by this name. The significance of the word, which is a translation of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Messiah</span>, is "anointed," and in the Old Testament it is given to priests (as <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3, 5, 16</a>), to a king appointed by Jehovah (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6, 10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>), also to King Cyrus (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), and to some unnamed representative of Jehovah (<a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>). It was subsequently applied to Jesus both in the Greek form and in the Hebrew (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>; <a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>). It must, however, be noticed ( <span class="accented">vide</span> Bishop Westcott, Add.
