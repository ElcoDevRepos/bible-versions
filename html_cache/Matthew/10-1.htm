The act of calling them to Him signifies a personal and direct relationship, emphasizing the importance of discipleship and the intimate nature of their mission.<p><b>Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits</b><br>This authority is a direct empowerment from Jesus, highlighting His divine nature and sovereignty over the spiritual realm. Unclean spirits refer to demonic forces, and the authority given to the disciples signifies the breaking of Satan's power. This empowerment is a foretaste of the greater authority believers would receive through the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<p><b>so that they could drive them out</b><br>The ability to drive out demons demonstrates the in-breaking of God's kingdom, where evil is confronted and defeated.
