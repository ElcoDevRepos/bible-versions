It also highlights Jesus' obedience to the Father's will, setting an example for believers to follow the Spirit's guidance in their lives.<p><b>into the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness, or desert, is a significant location in biblical history. It is often a place of testing and preparation. The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>), and Elijah spent time there (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4-8</a>). The wilderness represents a place of solitude and dependence on God, away from distractions. For Jesus, it was a place to prepare for His public ministry and to confront spiritual challenges. Geographically, this likely refers to the Judean Desert, a barren and rugged area.<p><b>to be tempted by the devil</b><br>The purpose of Jesus' journey into the wilderness was to face temptation. The devil, or Satan, is the adversary and accuser, seeking to thwart God's plans. This temptation serves as a parallel to Adam's temptation in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3) and Israel's testing in the wilderness. Unlike Adam and Israel, Jesus remains sinless, demonstrating His role as the second Adam and the true Israel.

In one respect it stands almost, if not altogether, alone. It could not have come, directly or indirectly, from an eye-witness. We are compelled to look on it either as a mythical after-growth; as a supernatural revelation of facts that could not otherwise be known; or, lastly, as having had its source in our Lord's own report of what He had passed through. The first of these views is natural enough with those who apply the same theory to all that is marvellous and supernatural in our Lord's life. As a theory generally applicable, however, to the interpretation of the Gospels, that view has not been adopted in this Commentary, and there are certainly no reasons why, rejecting it elsewhere, we should accept it here. Had it been based upon the narrative of the temptation of the first Adam, in Genesis 3, we should have expected the recurrence of the same symbolism, of the serpent and the trees. Nothing else in the Old Testament, nothing in the popular expectations of the Christ, could have suggested anything of the kind. The ideal Christ of those expectations would have been a great and mighty king, showing forth his wisdom and glory, as did the historical son of David; not a sufferer tried and tempted. The forms of the Temptation, still more the answers to them, have, it will be seen, a distinct individuality about them, just conceivable in the work of some consummate artist, but utterly unlike the imagery, beautiful or grand, which enters into most myths. Here, therefore, the narrative will be dealt with as the record of an actual experience. To assume that this record was miraculously revealed to St. Matthew and St. Luke is, however, to introduce an hypothesis which cannot be proved, and which is, at least, not in harmony with their general character as writers. They are, one by his own statement, the other by inference from the structure and contents of his Gospel, distinctly compilers from many different sources, with all the incidental variations to which such a process is liable. There is no reason to look on this narrative as an exception to the general rule. The very difference in the order of the temptations is, as far as it goes, against the idea of a supernatural revelation. There remains, then, the conclusion that we have here that which originated in some communication from our Lord's own lips to one of His disciples, His own record of the experience of those forty days. So taken, it will be seen that all is coherent, and in some sense (marvellous as the whole is), natural, throwing light on our Lord's past life, explaining much that followed in His teaching.<p><span class= "bld">Led up of the spirit.</span>--Each narrator expresses the same fact in slightly different language. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/4-1.htm" title="And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,">Luke 4:1</a>) "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, was led in the wilderness." St. Mark (<a href="/mark/1-12.htm" title="And immediately the spirit drives him into the wilderness.">Mark 1:12</a>), more vividly, "Immediately the Spirit driveth Him into the wilderness." What is meant by such language? The answer is found in the analogous instances of seers and prophets. St. John was "in the Spirit on the Lord's day" (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>). The Spirit "lifted up" Ezekiel that from his exile by the banks of Chebar he might see the secret sins of Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a>). The "Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip" (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm" title="And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.">Acts 8:39</a>). Those who spake with tongues spake "by the Spirit" (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2</a>). The result of this induction leads us to think of the state so described as one more or less of the nature of ecstasy, in which the ordinary phenomena of consciousness and animal life were in great measure suspended. That gift of the Spirit had on the human nature of the Son of Man something of the same overpowering mastery that it has had over others of the sons of men. A power mightier than His own human will was urging Him on, it might almost be said He knew not whither, bringing Him into conflict "not with flesh and blood," but with "principalities and powers in heavenly places." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - THE TEMPTATION. (Parallel passages: <a href="/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1-13</a>; a summary in <a href="/mark/1-12.htm">Mark 1:12, 13</a>.) The Father's acceptance of the Lord's consecration of himself for the work of the kingdom does not exclude temptation, but rather necessitates it. Psychologically, the reaction from the ecstasy of joy in hearing the announcement of <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a> was certain; ethically, such testing as would accompany the reaction was desirable. Even the Baptist was, as it seems, not without a special temptation during this period (cf. <a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>; and Bishop Westcott's note). At the very commencement of his official life the Lord is led consciously to realize that he has entered on a path of complete trust (even as his brethren in the flesh, <a href="/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a>) for all personal needs, a path which required great calmness and common sense, and along which he must take his orders for final victory, not from worldly principles, but direct from God. In Luke the order of the second and third temptations is reversed. Against the supposition of Godet and Ellicott, that St. Luke is historically correct, the "Get thee hence Satan!" (ver. 10) seems conclusive. At any rate, for St. Matthew's aim in this Gospel the temptation that he places third is the crucial one; the true King will not take an irregular method of acquiring sovereignty. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>; temporal. Mark, "and straightway." Immediately after the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him. <span class="cmt_word">Was led up ... into the wilderness.</span> <span class="accented">Up</span> (Matthew only); from the Jordan valley into the higher country round (cf. <a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>), in this case into the desert (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>). There is nothing told us by which we may identify the place, but as the scene of the temptation must have been near the scene of the baptism, namely, on the west side of Jordan (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note), it may be presumed that the temptation was on the west side also. The sharp limestone peak (Godet) known since the Crusades as Quarantana, "from the quarantain, or forty days of fasting" (Trench, Studies,' p. 6), may, perhaps, have been the actual spot. The only important objection to this is that directly after the temptation (as seems most probable) he comes to John in "Bethany beyond Jordan," <a href="/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a> (not necessarily to be identified with "Bethabara" of the Received Text; its locality is quite unknown). If he went east of Jordan after the temptation, he would still be on one of the great roads to Galilee (<a href="/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52</a>, etc.). The conjecture that the fasting and temptation took place on Sinai is suggested by the analogy of Moses and Elijah, but by absolutely nothing in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">Led up of the Spirit into the wilderness;</span> Mark, "the Spirit driveth him forth;" Luke, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness" (with a leading that lasted throughout the temptation, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>...<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). He was no doubt himself inclined to go apart into the desert that he might meditate uninterruptedly upon the assurance just given, and the momentous issues involved in his baptism; but the Holy Spirit had also his own purposes with him. The Holy Spirit cannot, indeed, tempt, but he can and does lead us into circumstances where temptation is permitted, that we may thereby be proved and disciplined for future work. In Christ's case the temptation was an important part of that moral suffering by which he learned full obedience (<a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>). Notice that even if the expression in <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>, "the Spirit of God descending," does not in itself go beyond the expressions of Jewish teachers who deny his Personality, it would be hard to find so personal an action as is implied by the words, "Jesus was led up of the Spirit," attributed to the Spirit in non-Christian writings. For <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10, 11, 14</a> is much less definite, and passages, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12-14</a>, interpret themselves by <a href="/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. To St. Matthew himself the Personality of the Holy Ghost must, in the light of <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, have been an assured fact. <span class="cmt_word">To be tempted of the devil</span>. So Luke; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great calumniator, him whose characteristic is false accusation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> against men (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10-12</a>); against God (<a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>). Here chiefly in the latter aspect. Each of the three temptations, and they are typical of all temptations; is primarily a calumniation of God and his methods. Mark has "of Satan," a Hebrew word equivalent to "adversary," which the LXX. nearly always renders by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, (compare also <a href="/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22, 32</a>). Probably by the time of the LXX. the idea of the evil spirit accusing as in a law-court, was more prominent than the earlier thought of him as an adversary. Spiritual resistance by the evil spirit to all good is a less-developed thought than his traducing God to man, and, after some success obtained, traducing man to God. Evil may resist good; it may also accuse both God and those made after the likeness of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
