It symbolized the removal of dignity and was intended to shame the victim publicly. In biblical context, this act can be seen as a fulfillment of the suffering servant prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men." The stripping also prefigures the spiritual stripping of sin that Jesus would accomplish through His sacrifice.<p><b>and put a scarlet robe on Him</b><br>The scarlet robe was likely a military cloak, used here to mock Jesus' claim to kingship. Scarlet, a color associated with royalty and power, was used ironically to ridicule His title as "King of the Jews." This act of mockery fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the servant of the Lord is subjected to insults and spitting. The robe also connects to the imagery of sin in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where sins are described as scarlet, highlighting the burden of sin Jesus bore. The mock coronation with the robe, along with the crown of thorns and reed scepter, underscores the theme of Jesus as the suffering King, a type of Christ who reigns through sacrifice and humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being mocked and prepared for crucifixion in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>The individuals who are mocking Jesus, stripping Him of His clothes, and dressing Him in a scarlet robe as part of their mockery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, specifically at the Praetorium, the governor's headquarters.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/scarlet_robe.htm">Scarlet Robe</a></b><br>A garment placed on Jesus to mock His claim to kingship, symbolizing royalty but used here in derision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion.htm">Crucifixion</a></b><br>The method of execution that Jesus is being prepared for, a central event in Christian theology representing the atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_suffering.htm">Humility in Suffering</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to endure mockery and humiliation teaches us about the depth of His humility and love.

St. Mark and St. John call it purple (<a href="/mark/15-17.htm" title="And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,">Mark 15:17</a>; <a href="/john/19-2.htm" title="And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,">John 19:2</a>); but the "purple "of the ancients was "crimson," and the same colour might easily be called by either name. It was probably some cast-off cloak of Pilate's own, or, possibly, that in which Herod had before arrayed Him (<a href="/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>). Philo records a like mockery as practised upon an idiot at Alexandria, who was there made to represent Herod Agrippa II. (<span class= "ital">in Flacc.</span> p. 980). It was but too common a practice to subject condemned prisoners before execution to this kind of outrage. Here the point of the mockery lay, of course, in the fact that their Victim had been condemned as claiming the title of a King. They had probably seen or heard of the insults of like kind offered by Herod and his soldiers (<a href="/luke/23-21.htm" title="But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.">Luke 23:21</a>), and now reproduced them with aggravated cruelty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They stripped him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>).

They had heard of his claim to be a King, so they determined to deride him with the mockery of royal honours. They tore his garments from his mangled form, thus opening afresh his half-dried wounds. <span class="cmt_word">Put on him a scarlet robe</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>). This was probably the short military woollen cloak worn by officers, in colour either scarlet or purple, and fastened by a buckle on the right shoulder. Some think it was a cast-off garment from the wardrobe of King Herod, which they found and appropriated to this purpose. Whatever it was, its bright hue was suitable for this mockery of regal splendour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They stripped</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#948;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekdysantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1562.htm">Strong's 1562: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ek and the base of duno; to cause to sink out of, i.e. to divest.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
