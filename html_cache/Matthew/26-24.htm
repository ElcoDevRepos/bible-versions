The phrase "will go" indicates Jesus' impending death, which He acknowledges as part of God's sovereign plan. The phrase "just as it is written about Him" underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering and death, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. This highlights the divine orchestration of events leading to the crucifixion, affirming the reliability of Scripture and God's redemptive plan.<p><b>but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed</b><br>The word "woe" is a strong expression of grief or denunciation, often used by Jesus to pronounce judgment or lamentation. Here, it is directed at Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would betray Jesus. This betrayal was prophesied in passages like <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the Messiah. The phrase emphasizes the grave moral responsibility and the severe consequences of Judas's actions, despite the fulfillment of prophecy. It serves as a warning about the seriousness of sin and betrayal, especially against the Son of God.<p><b>It would be better for him if he had not been born.</b><br>This hyperbolic statement underscores the severity of Judas's betrayal and the eternal consequences he would face. It reflects the Jewish idiomatic expression of ultimate regret and the irreversible nature of his actions. The phrase suggests the profound spiritual and moral implications of rejecting and betraying Jesus, highlighting the eternal perspective of judgment. It serves as a sobering reminder of the gravity of sin and the importance of faithfulness to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_man.htm">The Son of Man</a></b><br>This title refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_betrayer.htm">The Betrayer</a></b><br>This refers to Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, who would betray Jesus to the religious authorities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_betrayal.htm">The Event of Betrayal</a></b><br>This is the act of Judas handing Jesus over to the chief priests and elders, leading to His arrest and crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophecies.htm">The Prophecies</a></b><br>The phrase "as it is written about Him" points to the Old Testament prophecies concerning the suffering and death of the Messiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the Last Supper, where Jesus shares a final meal with His disciples before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Despite the betrayal, Jesus's path to the cross was part of God's sovereign plan, fulfilling Scripture.

The verse therefore magnifies both the reliability of Scripture and the moral seriousness of responding rightly to the Son of Man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">The Son of man goeth as it is written.</span>--The words are remarkable as the first direct reference of the coming passion and death to the Scriptures which prophesied of the Messiah. It was appointed that the Christ should suffer, but that appointment did not make men less free agents, nor diminish the guilt of treachery or injustice. So, in like manner, as if taught by his Master, St. Peter speaks of the guilt of Judas in <a href="/context/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16-18</a>, and of that of the priests and scribes in <a href="/context/acts/4-27.htm" title="For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,">Acts 4:27-28</a>.<p><span class= "bld">It had been good for that man</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Awful as the words were, they have their bright as well as their dark side. According to the estimate which men commonly form, the words are true of all except those who depart this life in the fear and faith of God. In His applying them to the case of the Traitor in its exceptional enormity, there is suggested the thought that for others, whose guilt was not like his, existence even in the penal suffering which their sins have brought on them may be better than never to have been at all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Son of man goeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">departeth</span>). It is thus that Christ alludes to his approaching death (<a href="/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>; <a href="/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21, 22</a>; <a href="/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>, etc.), declaring thus the voluntary nature of his sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">As it is written of him.</span> Every minute detail of Christ's Passion enunciated by the prophets was fulfilled. "The prescience of God," says Chrysostom, "is not the cause of men's wickedness, nor does it involve any necessity of it; Judas was not a traitor because God foresaw it, but he foresaw it because Judas would be so." <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto that man by</span> (<span class="accented">through</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whom the Son of man is betrayed!</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x2e;</span> Judas could hear this and the following sentence, and yet retain his iniquitous purpose! <span class="cmt_word">It had been good for that man if he had not been born;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it were good for him if that man had not been born.</span> Jesus says this, knowing what the fate of Judas would be in the other world. There is no hope here held out of alleviation or end of suffering, or of ultimate restoration. It is a rayless darkness of despair. Had there been any expectation of relief or of recovery of God's favour, existence would be a blessing even to the worst of sinners; for they would have eternity still before them in which to enjoy their pardon and purification; and in such case it could not be said of them that it were better for them never to have been born. On one side of the mysterious problem connected with Judas and such-like sinners we may again quote St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 81, in Matthew'), "'What, then,' one may say, 'though Judas had not betrayed him, would not another have betrayed him?... Because if Christ must needs be crucified, it must be by the means of some one, and if by some one, surely by such a person as this. But if all had been good, the dispensation in our behalf had been impeded.' Not so. For the All wise knows how he shall bring about our benefits, even had this happened. For his wisdom is rich in contrivance, and incomprehensible. So for this reason, that no one might suppose that Judas had become a minister of the dispensation, he declares the wretchedness of that man. But some one will say again, 'And if it had been good if he had never been born, wherefore did he suffer both this man and all the wicked to come into the world?' When thou oughtest to blame the wicked, for that, having the power not to become such as they are, they have become wicked, thou leavest this, and busiest thyself and art curious about the things of God, although knowing that it is not by necessity that any one is wicked." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
