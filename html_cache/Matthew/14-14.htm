The setting is likely near the Sea of Galilee, a central location for Jesus' teachings and miracles. This area was a hub of activity and trade, making it a strategic place for reaching diverse groups of people. The act of stepping ashore signifies Jesus' readiness to engage with the people and address their needs.<p><b>and saw a large crowd</b><br>The presence of a large crowd reflects Jesus' growing popularity and the people's eagerness to hear His teachings and witness His miracles. This crowd likely consisted of individuals from various backgrounds, including Jews and possibly Gentiles, indicating the widespread impact of Jesus' ministry.

This compassion is not merely an emotional response but a driving force for His actions. It reflects the heart of God, who is described as compassionate and gracious throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). Jesus' compassion here prefigures His ultimate act of love and sacrifice on the cross.<p><b>and healed their sick</b><br>The act of healing signifies Jesus' authority over physical ailments and His role as the Great Physician. Healing the sick was a tangible demonstration of the Kingdom of God breaking into the world, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah bringing restoration and wholeness.
