They often positioned themselves as guardians of Jewish purity and were influential in the synagogues. Their observation of Jesus' actions reflects their role as religious watchdogs, scrutinizing behaviors that deviated from their interpretations of the law. This encounter takes place in a setting where Jesus is dining, likely in a home setting, which was a common place for teaching and fellowship in Jewish culture.<p><b>they asked His disciples</b><br>The Pharisees approached the disciples rather than Jesus directly, possibly indicating a strategy to undermine Jesus' authority by questioning His followers. This indirect approach might also suggest a level of intimidation or an attempt to sow doubt among the disciples. The disciples, being learners and followers of Jesus, were often questioned about His teachings and actions, reflecting the communal nature of rabbinic teaching where disciples were expected to defend and explain their teacher's actions.<p><b>&#8220;Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</b><br>Tax collectors were despised in Jewish society for their role in collecting taxes for the Roman occupiers and often for their reputation of extortion. Sinners, in this context, refers to those who were seen as living outside the bounds of the law, including those who did not adhere to the Pharisaic interpretations of purity. Eating with such individuals was seen as a sign of acceptance and fellowship, which was scandalous to the Pharisees who emphasized separation from impurity. This question highlights the tension between Jesus' ministry, which emphasized grace and outreach to the marginalized, and the Pharisaic focus on ritual purity and separation. Jesus' actions here foreshadow His mission to bring salvation to all, including those marginalized by society, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which speaks of bringing good news to the poor and freedom to the captives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and demonstrating the Kingdom of God through His actions and words.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

These were probably those who had been present at the healing of the paralytic. the scribes who had come from Jerusalem. They, of course, would not enter the publican's house, but they stood outside and watched the mingled guests with wonder, and asked their two-fold question, "Why do <span class= "ital">ye</span> eat and drink . . .

This is, therefore, the first time that Matthew speaks of them as coming into direct contact with Jesus. Although Mark (cf. Luke) says that the objection was raised by those among the Pharisees who were also scribes (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), yet the difference of expression from that in ver. 3 must not be overlooked. There the fact that they were scribes, accustomed to weigh the statements of the Law about blasphemy, etc., was prominent in the mind of the narrator; here it is rather the fact that they were Pharisees, men who by their very name professed to hold aloof from those who neglected the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Saw it</span>. They could freely come into the court of the house, and when there could both see and hear what was passing in the rooms that opened into it. <span class="cmt_word">They</span> said; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">dieebaat</span> (Vulgate); "were saying." Their eager talk is brought vividly before us. <span class="cmt_word">Unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">his disciples.</span> Probably these were nearer to the Pharisees than Jesus himself was, or perhaps the Pharisees thought it easier to attack Jesus through them. On the naturalness of this remark in the mouth of Pharisees, <span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, II. 2. p. 25. <span class="cmt_word">Why eateth your Master</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">Teacher</span> (Revised Version margin) is preferable, for both Pharisees and disciples realized that even Jesus' actions were intended to instruct his followers. But the reason for this action (<span class="accented">why</span>, cf. also ver. 14) they did not understand. It is possible that the order of the Greek points to irony on the part of the Pharisees. The man who presumes to be called <span class="accented">Teacher</span>, and whom the disciples accept as such, sets at defiance the primary rules of right and wrong. Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 4. p. 222) explains the variants "teacher" (here) and "drink" (parallel passages) by the original Aramaic word for "drink" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) having been written here with the peculiar spelling of the Samaritan Targum (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">publicans and sinners?</span> Who form but one class (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>).
