The act of coming to the owner indicates a relationship of trust and responsibility. In biblical times, servants were often entrusted with significant duties, reflecting the trust God places in His messengers. This phrase sets the stage for a dialogue that reveals the nature of the kingdom of heaven and the presence of evil within it.<p><b>&#8216;Sir, didn&#8217;t you sow good seed in your field?</b><br>The term "Sir" denotes respect and acknowledgment of authority, reflecting the reverence due to God. The question implies an expectation of purity and goodness from the owner, who is God. The "good seed" represents the Word of God or the children of the kingdom, as explained later in the parable. This reflects the biblical principle that God&#8217;s creation and intentions are inherently good, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>, where God saw everything He had made and declared it very good.<p><b>Where then did the weeds come from?&#8217;</b><br>The presence of "weeds" introduces the problem of evil and sin in the world. The question reflects a common theological inquiry about the origin of evil, which is addressed throughout Scripture. The weeds symbolize the children of the evil one, as clarified in the parable's explanation. This echoes the reality of spiritual warfare and the presence of false teachings and influences within the church, as warned in passages like <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. The question also highlights the mystery of iniquity, a theme explored in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, where the apostle Paul speaks of the secret power of lawlessness already at work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_owner.htm">The Owner</a></b><br>Represents God, who sows good seed in the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize the followers of Christ or angels who are concerned about the presence of evil.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents the world where both good and evil coexist.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_seed.htm">The Good Seed</a></b><br>Symbolizes the children of the kingdom, those who follow Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_weeds.htm">The Weeds</a></b><br>Represent the children of the evil one, those who follow the devil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_presence_of_evil.htm">Understanding the Presence of Evil</a></b><br>Recognize that evil exists in the world alongside good, and this is part of the current age until the final judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_and_trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Patience and Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Trust that God will ultimately deal with evil in His perfect timing, and our role is to remain faithful and patient.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_the_world.htm">Discernment in the World</a></b><br>Develop spiritual discernment to recognize the difference between the children of the kingdom and the children of the evil one.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_believers.htm">Role of Believers</a></b><br>As servants of the owner, believers are called to be vigilant and prayerful, seeking God's wisdom in dealing with the presence of evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_final_justice.htm">Hope in Final Justice</a></b><br>Hold onto the hope that God will bring about justice and righteousness, separating the wheat from the weeds at the end of the age.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Identify_weeds_in_church_community.htm">How can we discern "weeds" among "wheat" in our church community today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Enemy_s_role_in_sowing_discord.htm">What does Matthew 13:27 teach about the enemy's role in sowing discord?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_parable_to_Eph_6_12_on_warfare.htm">How does this parable connect with Ephesians 6:12 about spiritual warfare?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Handling_personal_weeds_our_response.htm">How should we respond when we notice "weeds" in our personal lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_protect_fields_from_weeds.htm">What practical steps can we take to protect our "fields" from "weeds"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_weeds_in_wheat_in_Matthew_13_27.htm">Why does Matthew 13:27 mention weeds among the wheat in God's kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_27_on_world_s_evil.htm">How does Matthew 13:27 address the problem of evil in the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_do_servants_question_in_Matt_13_27.htm">What is the significance of the servants' question in Matthew 13:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/key_teachings_events_in_matthew.htm">What are the key teachings and events in Matthew?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_it_permissible_to_beat_slaves.htm">Is it permissible to beat slaves?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_is_jesus'_ancestor__abiud_or_rhesa.htm">Which son of Zerubbabel is an ancestor of Jesus: Abiud (Matthew 1:13) or Rhesa (Luke 3:27)?

That&#8217;s the normal reflex of those who belong to him&#8212;take the problem to the One in charge (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>- Their action mirrors the disciples in <a href="/matthew/13-36.htm">Matthew 13:36</a>, who &#8220;came to Him&#8221; for clarity after the crowds dispersed. God welcomes questions that are rooted in faith and loyalty.<p>- In the parable, the servants symbolize God&#8217;s people (and ultimately the angels, <a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>). Their coming underscores relationship, responsibility, and trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sir, didn&#8217;t you sow good seed in your field?</b><p>- The servants begin with a settled conviction: the master only sows what is good. That parallels <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>&#8212;&#8220;God saw all that He had made, and it was very good&#8221;.<p>- Scripture repeatedly affirms God&#8217;s unwavering goodness: &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>); &#8220;A good tree cannot bear bad fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-18.htm">Matthew 7:18</a>).<p>- By calling Him &#8220;Sir&#8221; (literally &#8220;Lord&#8221;), they express respect and confidence. When circumstances look contradictory, believers start with what they know: the Lord&#8217;s character is flawless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where then did the weeds come from?</b><p>- The question exposes the age-old tension: if God is good, why is there evil? The next verse answers, &#8220;An enemy did this&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-28.htm">Matthew 13:28</a>).<p>- Scripture traces weeds&#8212;sin, lies, rebellion&#8212;to a personal adversary:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1&#8211;6</a> shows the serpent introducing corruption into a perfect garden.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> warns that &#8220;your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a> states, &#8220;The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.&#8221;<p>- The servants&#8217; question is healthy. Instead of doubting the master, they seek His explanation. Their posture teaches us to bring perplexities to God rather than assign blame to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/13-27.htm">Matthew 13:27</a> captures the shock of faithful servants who know their master&#8217;s goodness yet observe evil growing alongside the good. Their instinctive move&#8212;run to the master, affirm His goodness, and ask for insight&#8212;models how believers should respond to the presence of evil in a world God created good. The verse reminds us that evil is foreign, sown by an enemy, and that clarity comes only from staying near the Lord who planted the good seed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span>; <span class="accented">and</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The servants of the householder came.</span> The explanation (ver. 38) does not say who are represented by these; they must be really identical with some of the wheat, yet since they are spoken of as though they are also the agents of the Sower, they must represent the more active, and especially the ministerial, members of the kingdom. Is it a mere coincidence that historically the clergy have shown themselves always the most eager advocates of the policy of rooting up the tares? <span class="cmt_word">And said unto him: Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</span> <span class="accented">Thy</span>.
