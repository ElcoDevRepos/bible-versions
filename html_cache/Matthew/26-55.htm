The "crowd" refers to the group sent by the chief priests and elders, including Roman soldiers and temple guards. This moment is pivotal in the Passion narrative, highlighting the transition from Jesus' public ministry to His path to crucifixion. The timing is significant, occurring after the Last Supper and Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane, marking the beginning of His suffering.<p><b>Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw?</b><br>Jesus questions the need for such force, emphasizing the irony and injustice of treating Him like a common criminal. The use of "swords and clubs" indicates the crowd's readiness for violence, reflecting the authorities' fear of Jesus' influence. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jesus is portrayed as the suffering servant (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>), who is "numbered with the transgressors." It also highlights the misunderstanding and rejection of Jesus' peaceful mission.<p><b>Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts</b><br>Jesus reminds the crowd of His public and peaceful ministry. The "temple courts" were central to Jewish religious life, where Jesus often taught openly, engaging with both followers and critics. This setting underscores His transparency and the acceptance He initially received from the people. His teaching in the temple fulfills prophecies of the Messiah bringing wisdom and truth (<a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p><b>and you did not arrest Me.</b><br>This statement points to the authorities' previous reluctance to arrest Jesus publicly due to His popularity among the people (<a href="/matthew/21-46.htm">Matthew 21:46</a>). It highlights their hypocrisy and fear, choosing to arrest Him under the cover of night. This action fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah being betrayed and unjustly treated (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>).
