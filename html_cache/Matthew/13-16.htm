The term "blessed" indicates a state of divine favor and happiness. In biblical context, seeing often symbolizes understanding and insight into spiritual truths. The disciples are privileged to witness the fulfillment of prophecies and the presence of the Messiah, which many prophets and righteous people longed to see (<a href="/matthew/13-17.htm">Matthew 13:17</a>). This blessing is not just physical sight but spiritual perception, recognizing Jesus as the Christ.<p><b>because they see,</b><br>The ability to "see" here refers to spiritual discernment and the recognition of Jesus' identity and mission. This is a gift from God, as spiritual understanding is often depicted as being granted by divine revelation (<a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>). The disciples' ability to see is contrasted with the spiritual blindness of the Pharisees and others who rejected Jesus despite witnessing His miracles and teachings. This seeing is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people's inability to perceive God's work is lamented.<p><b>and your ears</b><br>Hearing in the biblical sense often implies obedience and receptivity to God's word. The disciples are commended for their openness to Jesus' teachings, unlike many of their contemporaries who heard but did not understand or accept His message. In the cultural context of the time, hearing was a primary means of learning and passing down teachings, making the ability to truly hear and comprehend a significant blessing.<p><b>because they hear.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the disciples' ability to understand and accept the teachings of Jesus. Hearing is linked to faith, as stated in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, "faith comes from hearing the message." The disciples' hearing is not just auditory but involves a deeper comprehension and acceptance of the truth. This ability to hear and understand is a fulfillment of the promise that God would reveal His mysteries to those who are open and receptive (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-26</a>). The disciples' hearing is a sign of their chosen status and their role in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, contrasting their understanding with the spiritual blindness of others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are blessed with the ability to perceive spiritual truths.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' parables in <a href="/bsb/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, representing God's reign and the spiritual truths He reveals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/parables.htm">Parables</a></b><br>Jesus uses parables in this chapter to convey deep spiritual truths, which are understood by those with spiritual insight.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Represents those who hear Jesus' teachings but do not understand due to spiritual blindness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_perception_as_a_blessing.htm">Spiritual Perception as a Blessing</a></b><br>Recognize that the ability to understand spiritual truths is a gift from God, not a result of human wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Depend on the Holy Spirit to open your eyes and ears to the truths of God's Word, as spiritual understanding is spiritually discerned.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contrast_with_spiritual_blindness.htm">Contrast with Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Be aware of the dangers of spiritual blindness and hardness of heart, which prevent understanding and acceptance of God's truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_for_spiritual_insight.htm">Gratitude for Spiritual Insight</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of gratitude for the spiritual insight you have received, acknowledging it as a blessing from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_listening_and_seeing.htm">Active Listening and Seeing</a></b><br>Engage actively with Scripture and teachings, seeking to see and hear with spiritual eyes and ears, applying what you learn to your life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_nurture_blessed_senses_daily.htm">How can we cultivate "blessed" eyes and ears in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_16_Privilege_of_insight.htm">What does Matthew 13:16 reveal about the privilege of understanding Jesus' teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_13_16_to_Sower_Parable.htm">How does Matthew 13:16 connect to the parable of the sower?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_keep_spiritual_senses_open.htm">In what ways can we ensure our spiritual senses remain open to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_share_Matthew_13_16_s_blessings.htm">How can we help others experience the blessings mentioned in Matthew 13:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_16_on_spiritual_insight.htm">What does Matthew 13:16 reveal about spiritual perception and understanding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_16_s_impact_on_blessings.htm">How does Matthew 13:16 challenge our view of spiritual blessings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_can_some_see_and_hear_in_Matt_13_16.htm">Why are some people able to "see" and "hear" according to Matthew 13:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'first_will_be_last'_mean.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'first will be last'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_swearing.htm">Why does God cause people's hearts to harden?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_was_cyril_of_jerusalem.htm">Who was Cyril of Jerusalem and what did he teach?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_allow_injustice_to_persist.htm">In Psalm 94:9, it says God hears and sees all;

The verses stand there, that is to say, in close connexion with the other great utterance contrasting God's revelation of spiritual things to some and his hiding them from others. Possibly he spoke the verses only once (cf. the repetitions in the Prophets), but, in view of the frequency with which Christ's utterances are placed out of their original connexion, the assumption should be the other way. If he really only spoke them once, we cannot be sure which the occasion was, but the possibility that they do not properly belong here is increased by the doubt whether also ver. 12 was originally spoken now. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But blessed</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">are your eyes</span>.

This may refer to the disciples being able to see spiritual truths <span class="accented">before</span> God's special grace given them by way of reward to this effect, but this hardly suits the context from the phrase, "it is given" (ver. 12). It is, therefore, better to understand the verse to refer to their seeing and hearing things by virtue of grace given <span class="accented">in reward for</span> earlier faithfulness. Edersheim ('Life,' 1:594) gives a striking illustration of the thought of this verse from the 'Pesiqta' (edit.
