The offering of wine was a gesture that might seem merciful, but it also served to prolong the suffering by keeping the victim conscious longer. This moment fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, which speaks of giving gall and vinegar to drink.<p><b>mixed with gall</b><br>Gall refers to a bitter substance, possibly myrrh or a similar bitter herb, which was mixed with the wine. This mixture was intended to act as a narcotic to ease the pain of crucifixion. The bitterness of gall symbolizes the bitterness of sin and suffering that Jesus bore on behalf of humanity. The use of gall also connects to the Old Testament, where bitterness often symbolizes suffering and judgment.<p><b>but after tasting it, He refused to drink it</b><br>Jesus' refusal to drink the wine mixed with gall demonstrates His willingness to fully experience the suffering of the crucifixion with a clear mind. This act signifies His complete submission to the Father's will and His determination to endure the full extent of human suffering without alleviation. It highlights His role as the Suffering Servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bears the sins of many.

He will endure the cross fully alert, choosing to bear our sin without shortcuts, keeping His promise not to drink again until the Kingdom is realized. The verse reveals His conscious, prophetic, and sacrificial obedience, assuring believers that our redemption was accomplished with nothing less than His undiminished, willing suffering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Vinegar to drink mingled with gall.</span>--In <a href="/mark/15-23.htm" title="And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.">Mark 15:23</a>, "wine mingled with myrrh." The animal secretion known as "gall" is clearly out of the question, and the meaning of the word is determined by its use in the Greek version of the Old Testament, where it stands for the "wormwood" of <a href="/proverbs/5-4.htm" title="But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.">Proverbs 5:4</a>, for the poisonous herb joined with "wormwood" in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>. It was clearly something at once nauseous and narcotic, given by the merciful to dull the pain of execution, and mixed with the sour wine of the country and with myrrh to make it drinkable. It may have been hemlock, or even poppy-juice, but there are no materials for deciding. It is probable that the offer came from the more pitiful of the women mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/23-27.htm" title="And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.">Luke 23:27</a>) as following our Lord and lamenting. Such acts were among the received "works of mercy" of the time and place. The "tasting" implied a recognition of the kindly purpose of the act, but a recognition only. In the refusal to do more than taste we trace the resolute purpose to drink the cup which His Father had given Him to the last drop, and not to dull either the sense of suffering nor the clearness of His communion with His Father with the slumberous potion. The same draught was, we may believe, offered to the two criminals who were crucified with Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-44.</span> - <span class="accented">The Crucifixion and the mockery.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23-32</a>; <a href="/luke/23-32.htm">Luke 23:32-43</a>; <a href="/john/19-18.htm">John 19:18-24</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vinegar...mingled with gall</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). Instead of "vinegar" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) very many manuscripts, followed by Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and others, read here, as in Mark, "wine" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="accented">Dederunt ei viaum bibere</span> (Vulgate). Doubtless the two words represent the same fluid, a wine of a sharp and acrid taste. The received reading in our text is supposed to be derived from <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me gall for my meats, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." "Gall" here signifies some bitter ingredient (St. Mark calls it "myrrh"), which was infused in the wine to impart a narcotic quality. It was the custom to offer this draught to criminals about to undergo crucifixion, either as an anodyne or to give them adventitious strength to bear their sufferings. The beverage is said to have been prepared by some benevolent ladies in Jerusalem, and to have been owed to a gloss on <a href="/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul; let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more." This was not an additional insult offered to Jesus, as some have opined, but a usual act of kindliness. <span class="cmt_word">When he had tasted</span> thereof, <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">would not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>drink</span>. He accepted the kindly offer so far as to put his lips to the cup, but, recognizing its stupefying qualities, he refused to drink it. He willed to endure all the coming pains without mitigation; he would meet all with the powers of mind and body undarkened; he would have his senses and his self-consciousness unimpaired to the end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">they offered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ed&#333;kan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
