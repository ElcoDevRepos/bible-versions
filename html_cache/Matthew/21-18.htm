Jesus' return to the city signifies His continued mission and purpose, as Jerusalem is the place where significant events of His ministry, including His crucifixion and resurrection, would unfold. This journey also fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah's presence in Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>.<p><b>He was hungry</b><br>This phrase highlights the humanity of Jesus, showing that He experienced physical needs like hunger. It serves as a reminder of the Incarnation, where Jesus, though fully divine, took on human form and its limitations. This moment also sets the stage for the subsequent teaching moment with the fig tree, illustrating spiritual truths about fruitfulness and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is returning to Jerusalem.

Jesus had spent the previous night in Bethany (<a href="/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>), and daylight brings a fresh scene.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights significant moments that happen early in the day&#8212;times when God&#8217;s people seek Him and carry out His purposes. <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a> says, &#8220;In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice.&#8221; <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a> shows Jesus Himself rising &#8220;very early in the morning&#8221; to pray.<p>&#8226; The literal note of dawn reminds us that God is involved in the routine rhythm of life. His plans unfold in ordinary hours, underscoring His sovereignty over every moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as Jesus was returning to the city</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The city&#8221; refers to Jerusalem, where Jesus had just made His triumphal entry (<a href="/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>) and cleansed the temple (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>). Now He is walking back, likely along the familiar road from Bethany.<p>&#8226; Each step is deliberate. <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> had foretold the King&#8217;s entrance, and Jesus is fulfilling that prophecy in full view of the people. The return journey emphasizes His continual mission focus&#8212;He does not linger in comfort but heads straight back to the place of confrontation and redemption.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a> reminds us that Jesus &#8220;resolutely set His face to go to Jerusalem,&#8221; and here we see that determination still on display the very next morning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was hungry</b><p>&#8226; The statement &#8220;He was hungry&#8221; underscores Christ&#8217;s true humanity. <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a> records that after forty days of fasting, &#8220;He was hungry,&#8221; and <a href="/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6</a> notes that He grew weary by a well.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a> affirms that Jesus was &#8220;tempted in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin.&#8221; Real fatigue and real hunger show that our Savior fully entered our experience.<p>&#8226; This hunger also sets the stage for the fig tree event that follows (<a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19-22</a>). His physical need becomes an opportunity to teach a spiritual lesson about fruitfulness and faith&#8212;paralleling Old Testament warnings such as <a href="/micah/7-1.htm">Micah 7:1-2</a>, where a barren fig tree symbolizes unfaithful Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18</a> presents a literal snapshot of Jesus on a fresh morning, walking the road back to Jerusalem and experiencing genuine human hunger. Each detail carries meaning: the early hour reminds us of divine purpose unfolding in everyday time; the journey to the city highlights Christ&#8217;s unwavering resolve to complete His mission; and His hunger confirms His full humanity while preparing us for the fig tree lesson that follows. Together these elements affirm the trustworthiness of Scripture and point us to a Savior who is both sovereign Lord and sympathetic High Priest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">In the morning.</span>--The word implies "daybreak," probably about 5 A.M. This was the usual Jewish time for the first food of the day. If we may infer from <a href="/luke/21-37.htm" title="And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.">Luke 21:37</a>, <a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>, that the greater part of the night had been spent either in solitary prayer or in converse with the disciples, we have an explanation of the exhaustion which sought food wherever there might seem even a chance of finding it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-22.</span> - <span class="accented">The cursing of the barren fig tree</span>. (<a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>:, 20-26.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the morning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which implies a very early time of the day, and is a term used for the fourth or last watch of the night, <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). St. Matthew has combined in one view a transaction which had two separate stages, as we gather from the narrative of St. Mark. The curse was uttered on the Monday morning, before the cleansing of the temple; the effect was beheld and the lesson given on the Tuesday, when Jesus was visiting Jerusalem for the third time (vers. 20-22). Strauss and his followers, resenting the miraculous in the incident, have imagined that the whole story is merely an embodiment and development of the parable of the fruitless fig tree recorded by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6</a>, etc.), which in course of time assumed this historical form. There is no ground whatever for this idea. It claims to be, and doubtless is, the account of a real fact, naturally connected with the circumstances of the time, and of great practical importance. <span class="cmt_word">He hungered.</span> True Man, he showed the weakness of his human nature, even when about to exert his power in the Divine. There is no need, rather it is unseemly to suppose (as many old commentators have done), that this hunger was miraculous or assumed, in order to give occasion for the coming miracle. Christ had either passed the night on the mountain-side in prayer and fasting, or had started from his lodging without breaking his fast. His followers do not seem to have suffered in the same way; and it was doubtless owing to his mental preoccupation and self-forgetfulness that the Lord had not attended to bodily wants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In the morning,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#961;&#969;&#8146;</span> <span class="translit">(Pr&#333;i)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4404.htm">Strong's 4404: </a> </span><span class="str2">Early in the morning, at dawn.
