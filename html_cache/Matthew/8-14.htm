Peter's house is traditionally believed to be in Capernaum, a significant location in Jesus' ministry. Archaeological findings suggest that Capernaum was a small fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which aligns with Peter's occupation as a fisherman. This setting underscores the humble and ordinary circumstances in which Jesus often operated, contrasting with the expectations of a Messiah who would come in grandeur.<p><b>He saw Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law</b><br>The mention of Peter's mother-in-law provides insight into Peter's personal life, indicating that he was married. This detail is significant in understanding the early disciples' backgrounds and the normalcy of their lives before following Jesus. It also reflects the familial responsibilities that the disciples might have had, which they set aside to follow Christ. The presence of a mother-in-law in the household suggests a close-knit family structure, common in Jewish culture, where extended family members often lived together.<p><b>sick in bed with a fever</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of the time, a fever was often seen as a serious ailment, potentially life-threatening, due to the lack of modern medical knowledge and treatment. The description of her being "sick in bed" indicates the severity of her condition, as she was unable to perform her usual duties. In Jewish tradition, illness was sometimes viewed as a result of sin or spiritual affliction, though Jesus often challenged these assumptions. The healing of Peter's mother-in-law not only demonstrates Jesus' compassion and authority over physical ailments but also prefigures His ultimate victory over sin and death. This act of healing is a type of Christ's redemptive work, showcasing His power to restore and renew.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, originally named Simon, who becomes a leading figure in the early Christian church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter's_mother-in-law.htm">Peter&#8217;s Mother-in-law</a></b><br>The woman who is healed by Jesus in this passage, indicating Peter's marital status.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter's_house.htm">Peter&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, likely in Capernaum, which served as a base for Jesus' ministry in Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fever.htm">The Fever</a></b><br>The illness from which Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law suffers, demonstrating Jesus' authority over sickness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_compassion_and_authority.htm">Jesus' Compassion and Authority</a></b><br>Jesus' immediate response to the illness shows His compassion and willingness to heal.

And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they sought him for her.">Luke 4:38</a>) relate more specifically that it was on the Sabbath, and that our Lord had previously taught in the synagogue and healed a demoniac. The sons of Zebedee and of Jona had all been present, and when the service was over they came to the house in which Peter apparently (though born in Bethsaida, <a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>) had settled on his marriage.<p><span class= "bld">His wife's mother.</span>--The fact of St. Peter's marriage has not unnaturally been almost unduly prominent in the Protestant argument against the enforced celibacy of the clergy. "Here," it has been said, "is the Apostle from whom the Bishop of Rome claims succession, married when called to his office, and never separated from his wife, and yet Rome declares the marriage of priests to be unlawful, and stigmatises it as worse than concubinage." Telling as it may sound, however, it is after all only an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem.</span> Had the case been otherwise, we should not have admitted that the celibacy of the chief of the Apostles was a ground for compelling all bishops, elders, and deacons of the Church to follow his example. And all that can be urged, as the case stands, is that there is an inconsistency in accepting these facts, and yet treating marriage as <span class= "ital">incompatible</span> with the sacred office of the ministry. The Church of Rome might answer, that experience, or the teaching of the Spirit, or the moral authority of the saints and Fathers of the Church, outweighed the inference from St. Peter's example, and the question must be discussed on wider ethical and social, as well as Scriptural, grounds. In that argument, it is believed, those who advocate Christian liberty (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1Corinthians 9:5</a>) as most in harmony with the mind of Christ are not likely to get the worst of it.<p><span class= "bld">Sick of a fever.</span>--St. Luke, with a kind of medical precision, adds, "with a great fever," and that they (Peter, John, and the others) asked Him about her, as if consulting about a case of which they almost despaired.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The <span class="accented">healing of St. Peter's wife's mother.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/1-29.htm">Mark 1:29-31</a>; <a href="/luke/4-38.htm">Luke 4:38, 39</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jesus was come into</span> <span class="cmt_word">Peter's house.</span> Straight from the synagogue (parallel passages), for food, ver. 15 (Chrysostom).
