In the context of <a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9</a>, Jesus had healed two blind men, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion. The urgency in their action reflects the transformative impact of their encounter with Christ. This mirrors the response of others who were healed or witnessed miracles, such as the leper in <a href="/mark/1-45.htm">Mark 1:45</a>, who also spread the news despite Jesus' instruction to remain silent.<p><b>and spread the news about Him</b><br>The spreading of news about Jesus highlights the natural human response to share good news, especially when it involves personal transformation. This act of spreading the news is significant in the context of first-century Judea, where oral tradition was a primary means of communication. The news about Jesus' miracles would have traveled quickly, contributing to His growing reputation as a healer and teacher. This also fulfills the role of witnesses, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth.<p><b>throughout the land</b><br>The phrase "throughout the land" suggests a widespread dissemination of information, likely reaching various towns and villages in the region of Galilee and beyond. This geographical spread is important for understanding the growing influence of Jesus' ministry. The land referred to here is likely the region of Galilee, a significant area in Jesus' ministry, known for its diverse population and strategic location. This widespread sharing of news would have set the stage for the large crowds that followed Jesus, as seen in subsequent chapters of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Matthew, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_men.htm">The Blind Men</a></b><br>Two individuals who were healed by Jesus, demonstrating His compassion and divine power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the region of Galilee where Jesus was ministering at the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>The healed men could not contain their excitement and gratitude, leading them to share their experience with others.

The verse reminds believers that when Christ transforms a life, the natural next step is outward movement, enthusiastic proclamation, Christ-focused content, and far-reaching influence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">They . . . spread abroad his fame.</span>--As in other cases, so in this, the command was not obeyed. The question has been raised, whether the zeal which thus showed itself was or not praiseworthy; and, curiously enough, has been answered by most patristic and Roman Catholic commentators in the affirmative, some even maintaining that the command was not meant seriously; and by most Protestant commentators in the negative. There can be no doubt that the latter take that which is ethically the truer view. "To obey is better than sacrifice," better even than unrestrained emotion, better certainly than garrulous excitement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But they, when they were</span> <span class="cmt_word">departed;</span> <span class="accented">but they went forth and</span> (Revised Version).
