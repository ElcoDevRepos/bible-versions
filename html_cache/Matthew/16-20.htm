The term "admonished" indicates a strong, authoritative command, reflecting His role as their teacher and leader. This moment follows Peter's confession of Jesus as the Messiah, highlighting the importance of understanding His identity but also the need for discretion at this point in His ministry.<p><b>not to tell anyone</b><br>The instruction to keep His identity as the Messiah a secret is known as the "Messianic Secret." This was a strategic decision by Jesus to prevent misunderstandings about His mission. The Jewish expectation of the Messiah was a political and military leader who would overthrow Roman rule. By keeping His identity concealed, Jesus aimed to avoid premature confrontation with authorities and to focus on teaching His disciples the true nature of His kingdom.<p><b>that He was the Christ</b><br>The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This title carries significant Old Testament connotations, pointing to prophecies about a coming savior and king. Jesus fulfilled these prophecies, but His mission was spiritual rather than political. The disciples needed to grasp the full scope of His mission, which included suffering, death, and resurrection, before proclaiming Him as the Christ to others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is instructing His disciples in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being instructed not to reveal His identity as the Christ at this time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea_philippi.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a></b><br>The location where this conversation takes place, a region known for its pagan worship and diverse religious beliefs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_timing.htm">Understanding Divine Timing</a></b><br>Jesus' instruction to keep His identity a secret highlights the importance of God's timing in His plan.

Had the disciples gone about, not only as proclaiming the kingdom and as preachers of repentance, but sounding the watchword that the Christ had come, it might not have been difficult for them to gather round Him the homage of excited crowds. It was not such homage, however, that He sought, but that which had its root in a deeper faith. It tended to present a false aspect of His kingdom to the minds of men; it tended also to prevent the consummation to which He was now directing the thoughts of His disciples as the necessary condition of His entering on the glory of His kingdom. The zeal of the multitude to make him a king after their own fashion (<a href="/john/6-15.htm" title="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.">John 6:15</a>) was what He deprecated and shunned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then charged he his disciples.</span> Immediately after Peter's confession and Jesus' promise.

The injunction to tell no man (with which comp. <a href="/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>) was necessary at this time for many reasons. The time was not ripe for the declaration which might have led to tumult and disorder among an excited populace. Any ambitious ideas which the apostles might have formed from what had just passed were here nipped in the bud. They were not sufficiently familiar with the true notion of the Messiah, especially a suffering Messiah, to be competent to preach him to others. This we see by Peter's inconsiderate remonstrance in ver. 22. Till they received the Holy Ghost after Christ's ascension, they could not rightly and profitably preach of Christ's nature, office, and kingdom. Jesus may have looked forward to their desertion of him in his hour of trial, and prevented them from proclaiming his real character, which, in the face of such desertion, would have proved a stumbling block to the faith of believers. Some of these reasons we may reverently believe were those which led Christ to lay this severe restriction on the enthusiasm of his followers (see on Matthew 17:9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
