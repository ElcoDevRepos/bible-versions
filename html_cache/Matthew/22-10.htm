In the cultural context of the time, streets were places of commerce and interaction, suggesting the message was to reach all aspects of society.<p><b>and gathered everyone they could find</b><br>The act of gathering "everyone" signifies the inclusivity of the Gospel message. This reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) to make disciples of all nations. Theologically, it underscores the idea that salvation is available to all, regardless of social status, ethnicity, or previous religious background.<p><b>both evil and good</b><br>This phrase highlights the indiscriminate nature of the invitation to the kingdom of heaven. It echoes the parable of the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>), where both righteous and unrighteous coexist until the final judgment. It also reflects Jesus' ministry, where He associated with sinners and tax collectors (<a href="/mark/2-15.htm">Mark 2:15-17</a>), emphasizing grace and redemption.<p><b>and the wedding hall was filled with guests</b><br>The wedding hall symbolizes the kingdom of heaven, and its filling represents the fulfillment of God's plan to gather a people for Himself.

In the earliest times converts were baptized with very little preparation and without any probation, as we see in the case of the eunuch, the jailor, and many more mentioned in the Acts; and doubtless many were insincere and soon lapsed. When we read of whole households being baptized, and in later times of whole nations receiving Christian initiation, there must have been little individual preparation of heart or cleansing of conscience, and the missioner had to take for granted much which more careful examination would have proved to be fallacious.
