It highlights the danger of relying on heritage or tradition for spiritual security. The warning is against a false sense of security based on ancestry rather than genuine repentance and faith. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires a humble and contrite heart over mere external affiliations (<a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>).<p><b>&#8216;We have Abraham as our father.&#8217;</b><br>The Jewish people took great pride in their descent from Abraham, the patriarch with whom God made a covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This lineage was often seen as a guarantee of God's favor and blessing. However, the New Testament emphasizes that true children of Abraham are those who share his faith, not just his bloodline (<a href="/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). This statement challenges the notion that physical descent alone is sufficient for righteousness.<p><b>For I tell you</b><br>This authoritative introduction underscores the importance and certainty of the message that follows. It reflects the prophetic tradition where the speaker conveys a direct message from God. In the context of John the Baptist's ministry, it emphasizes his role as a prophet preparing the way for the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>).<p><b>that out of these stones</b><br>The reference to stones is symbolic and may have a dual meaning. Geographically, the wilderness of Judea, where John was preaching, is rocky and barren, making the imagery vivid and immediate. Theologically, stones represent lifelessness and the impossibility of human effort to produce spiritual life. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to demonstrate God's power to bring life from death (<a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>).<p><b>God can raise up children for Abraham.</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's sovereignty and ability to fulfill His promises in unexpected ways. It echoes the theme that God is not limited by human constraints or expectations. The idea that God can create a people for Himself from unlikely sources is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the calling of the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>). It also foreshadows the inclusion of all nations in the blessings of Abraham through faith in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, John the Baptist, is a prophetic figure who prepares the way for Jesus by calling people to repentance and baptizing them in the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_sadducees.htm">Pharisees and Sadducees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who often relied on their heritage and adherence to the law for righteousness.

Matthew denies its justice. <span class="cmt_word">Within yourselves</span>; cf. <a href="/esther/4-13.htm">Esther 4:13</a> (Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">We have Abraham to our father</span>. As it was recognized on all hands that the promise of blessing was made to Abraham and his seed, it is no wonder that many Jews presumed upon their descent from him, "sup, posing,", as Justin Martyr says ('Trypho,' &sect; 140.), that the everlasting kingdom will assuredly be given to those who are of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, although they be sinners and unbelieving and disobedient towards God." In later times, when the doctrine of merit was more fully established, God could be represented as saying to Abraham, "If thy children were like dead bodies without sinews or bones, thy merit would avail for them" ('Ber. Rabb.,' on Genesis 10:5:11. &sect; 44, middle). In John's words, on the contrary, we have the germ of the doctrine afterwards Brought out by St. Paul (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/galatians/3-9.htm">Galatians 3:9, 29</a>), that not natural descent, but spiritual relationship by faith, leads to inheriting the promises. The argument in <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, etc., is closely akin to that presented here. In both passages the Jews lay stress on their origin from Abraham; in both the answer is that morally they are sprung from a very different source (supra, ver. 7, note). But in <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>. the Jews are thinking chiefly of their present state, of not being as sinful as Jesus makes them out to be, while here they are thinking more of the future, that they have no need to take trouble, because promises for the future belong to them. Hence, perhaps, the exact expression (contrast <a href="/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>), "We have Abraham as father," which brings out the protecting influence of Abraham as still available. <span class="cmt_word">For I say unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>).
