The disciples, experienced fishermen, would have been familiar with the sea's temperament. Jesus walking on water demonstrates His authority over nature, echoing Old Testament themes where God alone treads on the waves (<a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>). This miracle reveals Jesus' divine nature, affirming His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>they were terrified</b><br>The disciples' fear highlights their human limitations and lack of understanding of Jesus' divine power. Despite witnessing previous miracles, they struggle to comprehend the full extent of His authority. This reaction is consistent with human responses to divine encounters throughout Scripture, where fear often precedes understanding and revelation (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p><b>&#8220;It&#8217;s a ghost!&#8221; they said</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, belief in spirits or ghosts was common. The disciples' immediate assumption reflects their fear and confusion, as they attempt to rationalize the supernatural event with their existing beliefs. This reaction underscores their initial inability to recognize Jesus' presence and power, a theme that recurs in the Gospels as the disciples gradually come to understand His true nature.<p><b>and cried out in fear</b><br>The disciples' cry of fear is a natural human response to the unknown and the seemingly impossible. This moment of vulnerability sets the stage for Jesus to reveal His comforting presence and authority, as He often does in moments of human weakness and need. Their fear contrasts with the peace and assurance that Jesus brings, illustrating the transformative power of faith and trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who demonstrates His divine authority over nature by walking on water.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are in a boat on the Sea of Galilee, witnessing this miraculous event.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_galilee.htm">The Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A significant body of water in the region where many of Jesus' miracles and teachings took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_walking_on_water.htm">The Event of Walking on Water</a></b><br>A miraculous demonstration of Jesus' power and divinity, intended to strengthen the faith of His disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_misunderstanding.htm">Fear and Misunderstanding</a></b><br>The disciples' initial reaction to seeing Jesus, highlighting their human frailty and lack of understanding.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_jesus_in_our_storms.htm">Recognizing Jesus in Our Storms</a></b><br>Just as the disciples initially failed to recognize Jesus, we too can miss His presence in our life's storms.

Seeing power they cannot categorize exposes the limits of human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;It&#8217;s a ghost!&#8221; they said</b><p>- First-century Jews held common beliefs about spirits appearing over water at night. In their distress the disciples default to superstition rather than faith (<a href="/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37</a>).<p>- Their misinterpretation shows that even close followers can mistake Jesus&#8217; presence when expectations are clouded by fear (<a href="/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>- The exclamation underscores how little they yet grasped of His divine nature, despite witnessing the feeding of the five thousand just hours earlier (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cried out in fear</b><p>- The cry is visceral, not composed; raw emotion spills out before any theological reflection.<p>- Scripture repeatedly notes that fear can paralyze until God&#8217;s word intervenes: &#8220;Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress. He stilled the storm&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28-29</a>).<p>- Jesus immediately answers, &#8220;Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-27.htm">Matthew 14:27</a>), echoing God&#8217;s covenant reassurance &#8220;Do not fear, for I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p>- His presence transforms panic into peace, illustrating that faith grows as believers move from reacting to relying (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a> captures a real, historical moment that exposes the disciples&#8217; human frailty and magnifies Jesus&#8217; divinity.
