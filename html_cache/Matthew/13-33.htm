Parables were a common teaching tool in Jewish culture, allowing listeners to engage with the message on different levels. This method also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, where it is said that the Messiah would speak in parables.<p><b>The kingdom of heaven is like leaven:</b><br>Leaven, or yeast, is a substance used in baking to make dough rise. In Jewish tradition, leaven often symbolized sin or corruption, as seen in the Passover where unleavened bread is used to signify purity (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>). However, in this parable, leaven represents the transformative power of the kingdom of heaven, indicating that the kingdom's influence, though initially small, permeates and transforms the whole.<p><b>that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour:</b><br>The mention of a woman is significant, as women were typically responsible for baking in ancient Jewish culture. The "three measures of flour" is a large quantity, approximately 50 pounds, suggesting abundance and the extensive reach of the kingdom. This amount of flour is reminiscent of the hospitality shown by Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>, where he prepares a meal for divine visitors, symbolizing generosity and divine encounter.<p><b>until all of it was leavened:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the pervasive and complete influence of the kingdom of heaven. Just as leaven works its way through the entire batch of dough, the kingdom of heaven will ultimately transform the world. This transformation is gradual but inevitable, reflecting the prophetic vision of God's kingdom filling the earth, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>, where the stone becomes a great mountain that fills the whole earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Represents those who work to spread the influence of the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/yeast.htm">Yeast (Leaven)</a></b><br>Symbolizes the transformative power of the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_measures_of_flour.htm">Three Measures of Flour</a></b><br>Represents the world or society that is being influenced by the kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teaching, representing God's reign and influence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_small_beginnings.htm">The Power of Small Beginnings</a></b><br>Just as a small amount of yeast can leaven a large amount of flour, the kingdom of heaven starts small but has a profound impact.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transformative_nature_of_the_kingdom.htm">The Transformative Nature of the Kingdom</a></b><br>The kingdom of heaven works from the inside out, transforming individuals and communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation.htm">Active Participation</a></b><br>Like the woman who mixes the yeast into the flour, believers are called to actively participate in spreading the kingdom's influence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_in_growth.htm">Patience in Growth</a></b><br>The process of leavening takes time, reminding us to be patient as the kingdom grows and influences the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_influence.htm">Holistic Influence</a></b><br>The kingdom of heaven affects every part of life, just as yeast permeates the entire dough.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_13_33_God_s_kingdom_transforms.htm">How does Matthew 13:33 illustrate the transformative power of God's kingdom in us?

That certainty invites confident, faithful participation in His ongoing, world-shaping mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven.</span>--The parable sets forth the working of the Church of Christ on the world, but not in the same way as that of the Mustard Seed. There the growth was outward, measured by the extension of the Church, dependent on its missionary efforts. Here the working is from within. The "leaven"--commonly, as in the Passover ritual, the symbol of malice and wickedness (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>)--causing an action in the flour with which it is mingled that is of the nature of decay and tends to actual putrescence, here becomes, in the mode of teaching which does not confine itself within the limits of a traditional and conventional symbolism, the type of influence for good as well as evil. It can turn the flour into human food--this symbolism is traceable in the leavened loaves that were offered on the day of Pentecost (<a href="/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>)--can permeate the manners, feelings, and opinions of non-Christian societies until they become blessings and not curses to mankind. In the new feelings, gradually diffused, of Christendom as to slavery, prostitution, gladiatorial games--in the new reverence for childhood and womanhood, for poverty and sickness--we may trace the working of the leaven.<p>Descending to the details of the parable, it is at least open to us (as an application of it, if not as an interpretation) to see in the woman, as in the parable of the Lost Piece of Money (<a href="/luke/15-8.htm" title="Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?">Luke 15:8</a>), the representative of the divine Wisdom as working in the history of the world, or of the Church of Christ as embodying that wisdom. The <span class= "ital">three</span> measures of meal admit, in like manner, of many references, of which we cannot say with certainty that one is more likely to have been intended than another. The descendants of the three sons of Noah, or the Jew, the Greek, the Barbarian, as representing the whole race of mankind, or body, soul, and spirit, as the three parts of man's nature, which the new truth is to permeate and purify, are all in this sense equally legitimate applications.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the leaven.</span> Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/13-20.htm">Luke 13:20, 21</a>. The growth of the kingdom regarded in its quiet and secret influence. This is to be ultimately complete and universal. The prophecy is partially fulfilled with every fresh recognition of Christian principles in public opinion, or customs, or laws. For "every thought" shall be brought "captive unto the obedience of Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven.</span> This is the only passage where leaven is spoken of with reference to its permeating qualities alone, without any trace of the notion of defilement, which the Paschal and other regulations (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15, 18</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15, 18</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>) so readily suggested.
