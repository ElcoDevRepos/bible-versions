They are not given explanations, only instructions&#8212;yet they go.<p>&#8226; This moment also signals the public unveiling of the Messiah. Up to now, Jesus often avoided open acclaim (<a href="/matthew/16-20.htm">Matthew 16:20</a>), but here He deliberately orchestrates a visible entry that fulfills prophecy (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At once you will find a donkey tied there</b><p>The phrase &#8220;at once&#8221; underscores immediacy and certainty.<p>&#8226; Jesus knows exactly what awaits&#8212;even the location and condition of the animals&#8212;affirming His omniscience (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>; <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; The donkey is already &#8220;tied,&#8221; prepared in advance by divine providence.
