This term is used in other parts of the New Testament to denote a relationship that should be marked by trust and loyalty. The use of "Friend" here is poignant, as it underscores the gravity of Judas's betrayal. It also reflects Jesus' consistent approach of love and grace, even towards those who wrong Him.<p><b>&#8220;do what you came for.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' awareness of the events that are unfolding and His submission to the Father's will. It reflects His foreknowledge of Judas's intentions, as He had previously predicted His betrayal during the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-21.htm">Matthew 26:21-25</a>). Jesus' command to Judas to proceed with his actions demonstrates His willingness to fulfill the Scriptures and the divine plan of salvation. This moment is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend.<p><b>Then the men stepped forward,</b><br>The men who step forward are likely a combination of Roman soldiers and temple guards, as indicated in other Gospel accounts (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>). This detail highlights the collaboration between Jewish religious leaders and Roman authorities in the arrest of Jesus. The presence of a large group suggests the perceived threat Jesus posed to both religious and political establishments.<p><b>seized Jesus,</b><br>The act of seizing Jesus marks the beginning of His physical suffering and the fulfillment of His mission to be the sacrificial Lamb. This moment is significant in the narrative of the Passion, as it sets in motion the events leading to the crucifixion. The use of force contrasts with Jesus' peaceful demeanor and His earlier teachings on non-violence and love for enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-44</a>).<p><b>and arrested Him.</b><br>The arrest of Jesus is a pivotal moment in the Gospel narrative, signifying the transition from His public ministry to His passion and crucifixion. It fulfills the prophecies of the suffering servant found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah is described as being "oppressed and afflicted." The arrest also highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His death and resurrection, as He had repeatedly told His disciples that He would be handed over to the authorities, suffer, and rise again on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to be betrayed and arrested.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples, who betrays Jesus with a kiss, leading to His arrest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arresting_party.htm">The Arresting Party</a></b><br>A group of men, including soldiers and officials from the chief priests and elders, who come to arrest Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden_of_gethsemane.htm">Garden of Gethsemane</a></b><br>The place where Jesus is praying and where the arrest takes place, located on the Mount of Olives.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_betrayal.htm">The Betrayal</a></b><br>The act of Judas identifying Jesus to the arresting party with a kiss, fulfilling the prophecy of betrayal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_betrayal.htm">The Nature of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal often comes from those closest to us, as seen in Judas's actions.

And he was speechless.">Matthew 22:12</a>; and "comrade," and the old and not yet obsolete English "mate," come nearer to its meaning. In classical Greek it was used by fellow-soldiers, or sailors, of each other. Socrates used it in conversing with his scholars (Plato, <span class= "ital">Repub.</span> i., p. 334). It is probably immediately after the kiss had thus been given that we must insert the short dialogue between our Lord and the officers recorded in <a href="/context/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Friend</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">companion</span> (see <a href="/matthew/20-13.htm">Matthew 20:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>). The word seems, in the New Testament, to be always addressed to the evil, though in itself an expression of affection. Here Christ uses no reproach; to the last he endeavours by kindness andlove to win the traitor to a better mind. St. Luke narrates that Jesus called him by name, saying, "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Wherefore art thou come?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The Received Text gives <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, which has very inferior authority. There is great difficulty in giving an exact interpretation of this clause. The Authorized Version, as the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Ad quid venisti?</span>), takes it interrogatively; but such a use of the relative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span> is unknown. If it is interrogative, we must understand, "Is it this for which thou art come?" But Christ knew too well the purport of Judas's arrival to put such an unnecessary question. Others explain, "Do that, or, I know that for which thou art come." Alford, Farrar, and others consider the sentence as unfinished, the concluding member being suppressed by an aposiopesis consequent on the agitation of the Speaker, "That errand on which thou hast come - <span class="accented">complete."</span> More probably the clause is an exclamation, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> being equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as in later Greek, "For what a purpose art thou here!" It is, indeed, a last remonstrance and appeal to the conscience of the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Took him.</span> They seized him with their hands, but did not bind him till afterwards (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). Whether Judas had any latent hope or expectation that Jesus at this supreme moment would assert and justify his Messiahship, we know not. The histories give no hint of any such idea, and it is most improbable that the apostate was thus influenced (see on ver. 14). We must here introduce the incident recorded by St. John (John 18:4-9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Friend,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7961;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Hetaire)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2083.htm">Strong's 2083: </a> </span><span class="str2">A companion, comrade, friend.
