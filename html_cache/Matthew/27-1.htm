In Jewish tradition, the day begins at sunset, so "morning" here refers to the early hours after dawn. This timing is significant as it follows the illegal nighttime trial of Jesus, which was held by the Sanhedrin. According to Jewish law, trials involving capital punishment were not to be conducted at night, highlighting the irregularity and urgency with which the religious leaders acted.<p><b>all the chief priests and elders of the people</b><br>The "chief priests" were the leading priests in the temple, including the high priest and those who had previously held the position. The "elders" were respected leaders and members of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. This group represented the highest religious authority in Judaism at the time. Their involvement underscores the official and collective decision-making process against Jesus, reflecting the widespread rejection of His messianic claims by the Jewish leadership.<p><b>conspired against Jesus</b><br>The term "conspired" indicates a deliberate and secretive plan. This conspiracy was not just a spontaneous decision but a premeditated effort to eliminate Jesus, whom they saw as a threat to their authority and the stability of their relationship with the Roman occupiers. This aligns with earlier Gospel accounts where the religious leaders plotted to kill Jesus (e.g., <a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>).<p><b>to put Him to death</b><br>The ultimate goal of the conspiracy was Jesus' execution. This reflects the severity of the charges they intended to bring against Him, which included blasphemy and claims of kingship that could be interpreted as treason against Rome. This phrase also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the suffering and death of the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would be "cut off from the land of the living" for the transgressions of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>These were the leading priests in the Jewish religious hierarchy, responsible for temple rituals and maintaining religious order.

Their settled resolve &#8220;to put Him to death&#8221; demonstrates human sin and God&#8217;s sovereignty working simultaneously, setting the stage for the cross where redemption is accomplished exactly as Scripture foretold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXVII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Took counsel.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">held a council.</span> (Comp. the use of the word in <a href="/acts/25-12.htm" title="Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed to Caesar? to Caesar shall you go.">Acts 25:12</a>.) Another formal meeting was held (according to the Jewish rule that the sentence of the judges was not to be given at the same sitting as the trial) to confirm the previous decision, and probably to determine on the next step to be taken. It ended, as the next verse shows, in sending our Lord to Pilate, and leaving to him the responsibility of punishing. They entered, as the sequel shows, on a kind of diplomatic struggle as to the limits of the ecclesiastical and imperial powers, the former seeking to make the latter its tool, the latter to avoid the responsibility of seeming to act in that character.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus brought to Pilate.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-1.htm">Mark 15:1</a>; <a href="/luke/22-66.htm">Luke 22:66</a>; <a href="/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1</a>; <a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the morning was come.</span> This is the early morning of Good Friday, the 14th of Nisan. If the rulers had had special regard to legality, they could not have condemned Christ to death at night, as they had done at the late informal assembly; but their respect for conventional rules was overborne by passion and hatred. They had decreed his death by general consent, and then retired for a few hours' necessary rest. Now they again met together, still in the palace of Caiaphas (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>), in order to complete their evil work, to endorse the previous sentence, and, under some pretence, hand their Victim over to the Roman governor, who alone could execute their murderous purpose.

They were determined that he should die by an ignominious and cursed death, that his pretensions, as being sent by God, might be disposed of forever. Hence arose the persistent cry, "Crucify him!" (vers. 22, 23). The Jewish view of crucifixion is seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>.
