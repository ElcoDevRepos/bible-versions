It reflects their urgency and determination to ensure that Jesus' body remained in the tomb. This action was taken on the Sabbath, highlighting their prioritization of securing the tomb over strict Sabbath observance.<p><b>and secured the tomb</b><br>The securing of the tomb was a measure taken to prevent any tampering with Jesus' body. This was in response to Jesus' prophecy that He would rise on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). The religious leaders feared that His disciples might steal the body and claim He had risen, thus they took steps to prevent this.<p><b>by sealing the stone</b><br>Sealing the stone involved placing a seal on the stone that covered the entrance of the tomb. This seal was likely a cord stretched across the stone and fastened with clay or wax, bearing an official mark. Breaking the seal would be a serious offense, indicating tampering. This act was meant to provide both a physical and legal barrier to any interference.<p><b>and posting the guard</b><br>A guard was stationed at the tomb to ensure that no one could steal the body. This guard was likely composed of Roman soldiers, given the involvement of Pilate, and their presence added an additional layer of security. The presence of Roman guards underscores the seriousness with which the authorities took the threat of Jesus' predicted resurrection. This also sets the stage for the miraculous events of the resurrection, as the presence of guards would make any human intervention highly unlikely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chief_priests_and_pharisees.htm">The Chief Priests and Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were concerned about Jesus' prophecy of rising on the third day.

Their going demonstrates human resolve against God&#8217;s revealed plan, much like <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-4</a> portrays nations plotting &#8220;against the LORD and against His Anointed,&#8221; only to discover God &#8220;laughs&#8221; at their vain schemes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>secured the tomb</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Secured&#8221; conveys deliberate, thorough action. <a href="/acts/5-23.htm">Acts 5:23</a> uses the same idea when the apostles were found missing from a prison &#8220;securely locked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s command, &#8220;make it as secure as you know how,&#8221; implies they used every precaution in their power, yet God&#8217;s purpose would still prevail; <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a> reminds us He declares &#8220;the end from the beginning&#8230; My purpose will stand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> says, &#8220;Unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.&#8221; No amount of earthly security can override divine sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by sealing the stone</b><p>&#8226; A seal was an official mark of authority, like <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a> where a stone over the lions&#8217; den was &#8220;sealed with the signet ring of the king and his nobles.&#8221; Breaking such a seal meant violating Roman power as well as Jewish leadership.<p>&#8226; The stone itself testified to Jesus&#8217; genuine death and burial, fulfilling &#8220;He was buried&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a> shows a future angel &#8220;sealed&#8221; the abyss; in both cases, men or angels apply seals, yet God alone decides when they are broken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and posting the guard</b><p>&#8226; A Roman guard (likely 4-16 soldiers) stood watch. <a href="/matthew/28-4.htm">Matthew 28:4</a> notes that at the resurrection &#8220;the guards trembled and became like dead men,&#8221; proving their presence was real and powerless to stop God.<p>&#8226; After the resurrection, &#8220;some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-11.htm">Matthew 28:11</a>). Their eyewitness testimony forced the leaders to fabricate the bribery story (vv. 12-15), inadvertently confirming the empty tomb.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4 and 16</a>:23 show how Rome viewed custodial failure: it could cost a soldier&#8217;s life. That these guards later spread the leaders&#8217; lie underscores the monumental impact of what they witnessed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-66.htm">Matthew 27:66</a> shows determined religious and civil authorities doing everything humanly possible to keep Jesus in the grave: they go in person, employ maximum security, seal the stone with official authority, and station a professional guard. Each precaution, meant to silence the promise &#8220;After three days I will rise,&#8221; instead amplifies the miracle, verifying that the tomb was truly empty by God&#8217;s power alone. The verse thus affirms both the reality of Jesus&#8217; death and the certainty of His resurrection, demonstrating that no human scheme can thwart the plans of the Living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(66) <span class= "bld">Sealing the stone.</span>--The opening of the tomb had been already closed by the stone which had been rolled so as to fill, or nearly fill, it. The sealing was probably effected by drawing one or more ropes across the stone and fastening either end to the rock with wax or cement of some kind.<p><span class= "bld">And setting a watch.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with the guard.</span> What is meant is that the priests were not content to leave the work to the soldiers, but actually took part in it themselves.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 66.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, <span class="accented">and they</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>went.</span> They left the procurator's presence, relieved at having gained their request and precluded all fear of collusion. <span class="cmt_word">Sealing</span> <span class="cmt_word">the stone, and setting a watch</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">with the watch</span>; <span class="accented">cum custodibus</span>). The last words are variously rendered. Thus: "scaled the stone by means of the watch" (Alford); "scaling the stone, the guard being with them" (Revised Version); "as well as having the watch" (Webster and Wilkinson); "in concert with the guard" (Morison). This last expositor has best seized the complex notion contained in the evangelist's language: "They made the sepulchre sure by sealing the stone in concert with the guard (and thereafter leaving the guard to keep watch)." The stone was sealed probably in this manner: a cord was passed round the stone that closed the mouth of the sepulchre to the two sides of the entrance; this was scaled with wax or prepared clay in the centre and at the ends, so that the stone could not be removed without breaking the seals or the cord (comp. <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>). Thus carefully did Christ's enemies obviate the possibility of any fraud or collusion; thus did they themselves prove unanswerably the truth and reality of the resurrection of that same Jesus whoso dead body they so carefully guarded. "Everywhere deceit recoils upon itself, and. against its will supports the truth. It was necessary for it to be believed that he died, and that he rose again, and that he was buried, and all these things are brought to pass by his enemies .... The proof of his resurrection has become incontrovertible by what ye [his enemies] have put forward. For because it was sealed, there was no unfair dealing. But if there was no unfair dealing, and the sepulchre was found empty, it is manifest that he is risen, plainly and incontrovertibly. Seest thou how even against their will they contend for the proof of the truth?" (St. Chrysostom, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-66.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they went [and]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(poreuthentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4198.htm">Strong's 4198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To travel, journey, go, die. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">secured the tomb</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#963;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;sphalisanto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_805.htm">Strong's 805: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make safe (secure, fast).
