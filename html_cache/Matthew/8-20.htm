This response highlights Jesus' teaching method, often using direct and thought-provoking statements to convey deeper truths.<p><b>Foxes have dens</b><br>Foxes are common in the region of Judea and are known for their cunning nature. The mention of dens implies a place of security and rest, which even these wild animals possess. This imagery would resonate with Jesus' audience, who were familiar with the wildlife of their environment.<p><b>and birds of the air have nests</b><br>Birds, often seen as symbols of freedom and carefreeness, have nests as their resting places. This phrase emphasizes the natural provision for even the smallest creatures, contrasting with the human experience of Jesus.

This title emphasizes both His humanity and His divine mission, serving as a bridge between His earthly ministry and His heavenly authority.<p><b>has no place to lay His head</b><br>This statement underscores the transient and sacrificial nature of Jesus' ministry. Unlike the animals, Jesus does not have a permanent home or resting place, highlighting His commitment to His mission and the cost of discipleship. It reflects the humility and self-denial that characterized His life, as well as the rejection He faced.

The scribe had not counted the cost, and, like the young ruler that had great possessions, needed to be taught. To follow the Son of Man was not to be the adherent of a new sect or party, or the servant of a king marching onward to an earthly throne, but to share in poverty, privation, homelessness.<p><span class= "bld">Nests.</span>--The word is sufficient for popular use, but, strictly speaking, the "nest" belongs only to the brooding season of a bird's life, and the Greek word has the wider meaning of "shelter."<p><span class= "bld">The Son of</span> <span class= "bld">man.</span>--The passage is remarkable as the first in this Gospel in which the name occurs which was afterwards so prominent in our Lord's teaching, and this is accordingly the right place for tracing the history and significance of that title.<p>As found in the Old Testament, the term is the literal translation of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">ben-adam, the</span> latter word expressing the generic weakness and frailty of man's nature, as the Hebrew <span class= "ital">ish</span> expresses its greatness and its strength. It stands therefore as representing man idealised under that one aspect of his being. "What is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the <span class= "ital">son of man</span> that Thou visitest him?" (<a href="/psalms/8-4.htm" title="What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?">Psalm 8:4</a>); "Put not your trust in princes, nor in <span class= "ital">the son of man</span> in whom is no help" (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm" title="Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.">Psalm 146:3</a>), are instances of its use in this meaning. In some passages our version expresses the same thought by rendering the "<span class= "ital">sons of Adam"</span> and the "<span class= "ital">sons of Ish</span> "as" low and high" (<a href="/psalms/49-2.htm" title="Both low and high, rich and poor, together.">Psalm 49:2</a>), or the former word alone as "men of low degree" (<a href="/psalms/62-9.htm" title="Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.">Psalm 62:9</a>). The title received a new prominence about the time of the Captivity from its use in Ezekiel's prophecies. There it appears frequently (not fewer than eighty-seven times in all) as the title with which the prophet is addressed by the voice of Jehovah. We can scarcely doubt that it was used there in all the fulness of its earlier meaning, and was designed to teach the prophet that, amid all the greatness of his work, he was still subject to all the weakness and temptations of man's nature, and ought therefore to have compassion on their infirmities. Yet a fresh aspect of the name was presented in the mysterious vision of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, in which "One like the <span class= "ital">Son of Man</span> came with the clouds of heaven, and was brought to the Ancient of Days, . . . and there was given unto Him dominion and glory and a kingdom." The word used is not, it is true, <span class= "ital">benadam,</span> but <span class= "ital">bar-enosh,</span> but there is no traceable distinction of meaning between the two. Here, then, the thought manifestly was this, that One who shared man's weakness, should also be a sharer of God's glory, and be the Head of the divine kingdom. The prominence which the Maccabean struggles gave to the predictions of Daniel drew attention to the name as it had thus been used. The "Son of Man" became one of the titles of the expected Christ. The Targum or Paraphrase of the Psalms (probably earlier than our Lord's ministry) explains even such a passage as <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm" title="Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.">Psalm 80:17</a> ("the son of man whom thou madest so strong for thine own self") as referring to the Christ. So when the crowd at Jerusalem are questioning in their hearts whether Jesus was the Christ, they are not startled at this application of the name, and their question, "Who is this Son of Man?" is the utterance of their wonder that things so unlike what they expected of the Christ should be predicted of One who claimed the title (<a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>). It was accordingly, with these ideas attached to it--involving at once fellowship with the lowest of the heirs of our humanity, and yet also participation in the eternal glory of the Highest--that our Lord claimed the title, and used it with such marvellous frequency. We might almost say that it serves as the chief connecting-link between the teaching of the first three Gospels and the fourth. It appears thirty-two times in St. Matthew, fourteen in St. Mark, twenty-six in St. Luke, and twelve times in St. John. It is remarkable that it never passed into the current language of the Apostolic Church, nor into the theological or liturgical phraseology of Christendom. It is not used in any one of the Epistles. Outside the Gospels it is found only in the exclamation of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>), with a manifest reference to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, and possibly in the visions of the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>). The minds of believers loved to dwell on the glory of the risen Christ, and apparently looked on this as belonging rather to the time of His humiliation. Its absence from the other books of the New Testament, and its presence in the Gospels is, at all events, an indication that the latter were not the after-growth of a later age. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes</span>.

The renderings in the true text of the Vulgate (<span class="accented">tabernacula</span>), and in Old Latin k, and Cyprian (<span class="accented">devorsoria</span>) are interesting. Revised Version margin has, "Gk. <span class="accented">lodging places"</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a> and parallel pas sages). <span class="cmt_word">But the Son of man</span>. The original phrase, "one like unto a son of man," was used in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, apparently as a symbol of the Jewish nation, to which was to be given supreme power. There is no evidence that it was understood of Messiah before our Lord employed it, but rather the re verse (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>, and especially Professor Stanton, 'Jewish and Christian Messiah,' pp. 109, 239, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>; yet see Professor Sunday, in <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, January, 1891; cf. further, <a href="/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>, note). Our Lord uses it here for the sake of the contrast it suggested to the lower creation. Man, the head of creation (as none would acknowledge more fully than this student of the Law), has in the person of the ideal Man not even the luxuries which correspond to those enjoyed by beasts and birds. Such was the love and self-abasement of the Restorer of creation (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath not where to lay his head</span>. He has no home to call his own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/8-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Foxes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#974;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(al&#333;pekes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_258.htm">Strong's 258: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fox; a fox-like, crafty person.
