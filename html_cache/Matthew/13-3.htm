Jesus employed parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven to those willing to hear and understand, while concealing the truth from those with hardened hearts (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>). This method fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, highlighting the spiritual blindness of the people (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). Parables engage listeners, prompting them to reflect and discern the deeper meaning behind the narrative.<p><b>saying,</b><br>The act of speaking in parables was intentional and authoritative. Jesus, as the divine teacher, used His words to impart wisdom and challenge His audience. His teachings were not just informative but transformative, calling for a response from the hearers.<p><b>&#8220;A farmer went out to sow his seed.</b><br>The imagery of a farmer sowing seed would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, many of whom were from agrarian backgrounds. This setting provides a relatable context for the spiritual lesson. The farmer represents Jesus or anyone who spreads the message of the Kingdom. The act of sowing signifies the dissemination of God's Word. The seed symbolizes the message of the Gospel, which has the potential to bring forth spiritual fruit depending on the condition of the heart, as further explained in the parable. This imagery connects to Old Testament themes where God&#8217;s Word is likened to seed (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>) and highlights the importance of receptivity to divine truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is the one teaching the parable.

The verse invites every believer to listen attentively and join the ongoing work of sowing that same seed into a waiting world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">He spake many things unto them in parables.</span>--This is the first occurrence of the word in St. Matthew's Gospel, and it is clear from the question of the disciples in <a href="/matthew/13-10.htm" title="And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?">Matthew 13:10</a> that it was in some sense a new form of teaching to them. There had been illustrations and similitudes before, as in that of the houses built on the sand and on the rock in <a href="/context/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, and that of the unclean spirit in <a href="/context/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43-45</a>, but now for the first time He speaks to the multitude in a parable, without an explanation. The word, which has passed through its use in the Gospels into most modern European languages (<span class= "ital">palabras, parole, parabel</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> means literally, <span class= "ital">a comparison.</span> It had been employed by the Greek translators of the Old Testament for the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">mashed,</span> which we commonly render by "proverb," and which, like the Greek <span class= "ital">parabole,</span> has the sense of similitude. Of many, perhaps of most, Eastern proverbs it was true that they were condensed parables, just as many parables are expanded proverbs. (Comp. <a href="/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>; <a href="/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29</a>.) In the later and New Testament use of the word, however, the parable takes the fuller form of a narrative embracing facts natural and probable in themselves, and in this respect differs from the fable which (as in those of 'sop and Phaedrus, or that of the trees choosing a king in <a href="/context/judges/9-8.htm" title="The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.">Judges 9:8-15</a>) does not keep within the limits even of possibility. The mode of teaching by parables was familiar enough in the schools of the Rabbis, and the Talmud contains many of great beauty and interest. As used by them, however, they were regarded as belonging to those who were receiving a higher education, and the son of Sirach was expressing the current feeling of the schools when he said of the tillers of the soil and the herdsmen of flocks that they "were not found where parables were spoken" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-33.htm" title="They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.">Ecclesiasticus 38:33</a>). With what purpose our Lord now used this mode of instruction will appear in His answer to the question of the disciples. The prominence given in the first three Gospels to the parable that follows, shows how deep an impression it made on the minds of men, and so far justified the choice of this method of teaching by the divine Master. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake many things.</span> Of which but a few are here recorded (cf. vers. 34, 51). <span class="cmt_word">Unto them in parables.</span> Taking the expression in the widest sense, "speaking in parables" began in the very earliest ages, when natural or spiritual truths were described under figures taken from everyday life, and continues until the present time, more especially among Eastern nations. Interesting examples of such a method of instruction are to be seen in the Haggadoth (which are frequently parabolic narratives) of the Talmuds and other Jewish works. But both myth (cf. Alford) and parabolic Haggada share the common danger of being misunderstood as narratives which are intended to be taken literally, while in the parable, in the narrower sense of the word, such a confusion is hardly possible. For the narrative then suggests, either by its introduction or its structure, that it is only the mirror by which a truth can be seen, and is not the truth itself. Such parables also, though seldom even approaching in beauty to our Lord's, are very frequent in Jewish writings, though they come but seldom in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23-29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6-11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-40</a>; comp. also <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1-10</a>, which are rather allegories; and <a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-15</a> and <a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>, which are fables). (On the distinction of parable in the narrower sense from fable, myth, proverb, allegory, see Alford and Trench.) Weiss ('Life,' 2:115) thinks that the most profound reason of all which the Lord had for employing parables was that he wished to show that the same regulations which hold good for the world round us and ourselves in relation to the world and each other, hold good also in the higher ethical and religious life. But at the most this can have been a very subsidiary motive with him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Behold, a sower.</span> Observe that our Lord enters upon his parable at once (contrast ver. 24).
