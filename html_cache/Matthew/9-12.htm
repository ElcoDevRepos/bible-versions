In the context of <a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees who questioned why He ate with tax collectors and sinners. This reflects the broader theme of Jesus' ministry, which often involved challenging the religious leaders' understanding of righteousness and purity.<p><b>Jesus said</b><br>The authority of Jesus' words is emphasized here. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus speaks with authority, often contrasting with the teachings of the Pharisees and scribes. His words are not just responses but teachings that reveal deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>It is not the healthy who need a doctor</b><br>This metaphor highlights the purpose of Jesus' mission. The "healthy" refers to those who perceive themselves as righteous, often the religious leaders who believed they were spiritually well. The imagery of a doctor is significant, as it portrays Jesus as a healer, not just of physical ailments but of spiritual brokenness. This aligns with His role as the Great Physician, a theme seen in His healing miracles throughout the Gospels.<p><b>but the sick</b><br>The "sick" symbolizes those who recognize their need for spiritual healing, such as the tax collectors and sinners with whom Jesus associated. This phrase underscores the inclusivity of Jesus' ministry, reaching out to those marginalized by society. It also reflects the prophetic fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as bringing good news to the poor and healing the brokenhearted. Jesus' association with the "sick" demonstrates His mission to seek and save the lost, as further emphasized in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees' criticism of His association with tax collectors and sinners.

Whenever Jesus speaks, truth and grace converge (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>; <a href="/john/7-46.htm">John 7:46</a>). His words are never wasted; they cut through superficial religiosity and reach the heart (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is not the healthy</b><p>Here &#8220;the healthy&#8221; represents those who perceive themselves as righteous&#8212;like the Pharisees&#8212;yet in reality &#8220;There is no one righteous, not even one&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>). Jesus isn&#8217;t declaring some people truly sinless; He is exposing self-confidence that masks spiritual need (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-12</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). Thinking we&#8217;re fine keeps us from the Savior&#8217;s healing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who need a doctor</b><p>Jesus likens Himself to a physician. The Old Testament promised a Healer: &#8220;I am the LORD who heals you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>). <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> foretold that &#8220;by His stripes we are healed,&#8221; a prophecy Peter applies to Christ&#8217;s atoning work (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). Just as a doctor diagnoses, treats, and restores physical health, Jesus diagnoses sin, applies grace, and restores souls (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the sick</b><p>&#8220;The sick&#8221; are sinners who admit their brokenness. Paul echoes this truth: &#8220;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). Jesus seeks them out, &#8220;to seek and to save the lost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). When we confess our need, He provides forgiveness and new life (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>). The Pharisees&#8217; refusal to see their sickness left them outside the remedy that sat at their table.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/9-12.htm">Matthew 9:12</a> shows Jesus confronting spiritual pride with a simple medical illustration. Those who think they are healthy&#8212;self-righteous&#8212;see no need for a Savior, but those who know they are sick&#8212;aware of sin&#8212;run to the Great Physician.

That, speaking from the thoughts and standpoint of those addressed (which in another than our Lord we might term grave irony), which enters so largely into our Lord's teaching, appears here in its most transparent form. Those of whom He speaks were, we know, suffering from the worst form of spiritual disease, but in their own estimation they were without spot or taint, and as such. therefore, He speaks to them. On their own showing, they ought not to object to His carrying on that work where there was most need of it. The proverb cited by Him in <a href="/luke/4-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.">Luke 4:23</a> shows that it was not the first time that He had referred to His own work as that of the Great Physician.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when Jesus heard that,</span> <span class="cmt_word">he said unto them, They that be whole.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (so also Mark) may include an <span class="accented">arriere-pensee</span> of moral <span class="accented">self-assertion</span> which St. Luke entirely loses by his alteration to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Need not;</span> <span class="accented">have no need of</span> (Revised Version).
