This dismissal signifies a transition from public ministry to private instruction. The crowds often followed Jesus for His miracles and teachings, but not all were receptive to deeper spiritual truths. This separation highlights the distinction between general listeners and those who seek deeper understanding.<p><b>and went into the house.</b><br>The house likely refers to a private residence in Capernaum, a central location for Jesus' ministry in Galilee. This setting provides a more intimate environment for teaching His disciples. The shift from public to private underscores the importance of personal discipleship and the deeper revelation given to those committed to following Jesus.<p><b>His disciples came to Him</b><br>The disciples, distinct from the crowds, are those who have committed to following Jesus and learning from Him. Their approach to Jesus indicates a desire for deeper understanding and clarity. This reflects the role of discipleship as an active pursuit of knowledge and truth.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.&#8221;</b><br>The request for explanation shows the disciples' recognition of their need for insight into Jesus' teachings. The parable of the weeds, previously given in public, contains complex spiritual truths about the kingdom of heaven, judgment, and the coexistence of good and evil. The disciples' inquiry demonstrates their willingness to learn and their trust in Jesus as the source of divine wisdom. This moment also illustrates the pattern of Jesus providing deeper explanations to those who seek Him earnestly, fulfilling the promise that those who ask will receive.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who teaches through parables to reveal the truths of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who seek deeper understanding of His teachings.
