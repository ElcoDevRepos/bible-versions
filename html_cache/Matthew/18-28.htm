The act of going out signifies a transition from receiving mercy to interacting with others, highlighting the expectation of extending the same grace received. This reflects the biblical principle of forgiveness as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>, where believers are taught to forgive others as they have been forgiven.<p><b>he found one of his fellow servants</b><br>The term "fellow servants" indicates a peer relationship, emphasizing equality among individuals. This mirrors the Christian teaching that all believers are equal before God, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>. The encounter with a fellow servant underscores the communal aspect of faith, where relationships are governed by love and forgiveness.<p><b>who owed him a hundred denarii</b><br>A hundred denarii was a significant but manageable debt, equivalent to about a hundred days' wages. This contrasts sharply with the enormous debt the first servant was forgiven, illustrating the disparity between human offenses and divine forgiveness. The comparison serves to highlight the pettiness of holding grudges over relatively minor offenses when one has been forgiven much greater sins.<p><b>He grabbed him and began to choke him</b><br>The physical aggression depicted here is a stark contrast to the mercy shown by the master earlier in the parable. This act of violence symbolizes the destructive nature of unforgiveness and the human tendency towards retribution. It serves as a warning against allowing anger and bitterness to dictate actions, as advised against in <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31-32</a>.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Pay back what you owe me!&#8217;</b><br>The demand for repayment reflects a legalistic mindset, focusing on justice rather than mercy. This attitude is contrary to the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized forgiveness and reconciliation over strict adherence to the law. The insistence on repayment can be seen as a metaphor for the human inclination to seek personal justice rather than trusting in God's ultimate judgment, as discussed in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unforgiving_servant.htm">The Unforgiving Servant</a></b><br>A servant who, despite being forgiven a massive debt by his master, refuses to forgive a much smaller debt owed to him by a fellow servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fellow_servant.htm">The Fellow Servant</a></b><br>Another servant who owes the unforgiving servant a relatively small amount of money, symbolizing the minor offenses we encounter in daily life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God, who shows immense mercy and forgiveness, setting the standard for how we should forgive others.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_debt.htm">The Debt</a></b><br>The hundred denarii, a small debt compared to what the unforgiving servant was forgiven, symbolizes the minor grievances we hold against others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_confrontation.htm">The Event of Confrontation</a></b><br>The unforgiving servant's harsh treatment of his fellow servant highlights the hypocrisy and lack of mercy that Jesus warns against.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_forgiveness.htm">The Weight of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Understand the magnitude of God's forgiveness towards us and how it should compel us to forgive others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_in_unforgiveness.htm">Hypocrisy in Unforgiveness</a></b><br>Recognize the inconsistency in accepting God's grace while withholding it from others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_unforgiveness.htm">The Danger of Unforgiveness</a></b><br>Unforgiveness can lead to spiritual bondage and hinder our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_forgiveness.htm">Practical Forgiveness</a></b><br>Implement daily practices of forgiveness, remembering that no offense against us compares to our offenses against God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_character.htm">Reflecting God's Character</a></b><br>Strive to mirror God's mercy and compassion in our interactions with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_18_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 18:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_18_28_Why_forgive_others.htm">How does Matthew 18:28 illustrate the importance of forgiving others' debts or sins?

Though forgiven an immeasurable debt, the servant refuses to extend even limited grace to a peer. The verse warns believers to let God&#8217;s extravagant pardon shape our relationships, urging us to treat others with the same forgiveness and compassion we daily enjoy from the Lord (<a href="/matthew/18-33.htm">Matthew 18:33</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Which owed him an hundred pence.</span>--Here the calculation is simpler than in <a href="/matthew/18-24.htm" title="And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, which owed him ten thousand talents.">Matthew 18:24</a>. The "hundred pence" are a hundred Roman <span class= "ital">denarii</span> (the <span class= "ital">denarius</span> being equal to sevenpence-halfpenny), a hundred days' wages of the labourer and soldier, enough to provide a meal for 2,500 men (<a href="/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7</a>). There is a considerable truthfulness in the choice of such a sum, which has, perhaps, been too little noticed. Had our Lord been seeking simply a rhetorical antithesis between the infinitely great and the infinitely little, it would have been easy to select some small coin, like the <span class= "ital">denarius,</span> the <span class= "ital">as,</span> or the <span class= "ital">quadrans,</span> as the amount of the fellow-servant's debt. But to the fishermen of Galilee the "hundred pence" would appear a really considerable sum, and when they came to interpret the parable they would thus be led to feel that it recognised that the offences which men commit against their brothers may, in themselves, be many and grievous enough. It is only when compared with their sins against God that they sink into absolute insignificance.<p><span class= "bld">He laid hands on him.</span>--We are shocked, and are meant to be shocked, by the brutal outrage with which the creditor enforces his claim, but it doubtless was but too faithful a picture of what the disciples had often witnessed, or, it may be, even practised. We are tempted to ask whether this really represents any phenomena of the spiritual life. Can a man who has really been justified and pardoned become thus merciless? The experience of every age, almost of every household, shows that the inconsistency is but too fatally common. The man is not consciously a hypocrite, but he is as yet "double minded" (<a href="/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">James 1:8</a>), and the baser self is not conquered. In the language of the later teaching of the New Testament the man's faith is not one which "worketh by love" (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>).

The enormous difference between these two amounts represents the disproportion between the offences of our neighbours against us and those of which we are guilty towards God; and how small is the forgiveness on our side compared with that which God freely accords to our infinite debt to him!
