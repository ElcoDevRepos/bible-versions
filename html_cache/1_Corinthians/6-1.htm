In the early church, believers were expected to live in harmony, reflecting the unity of the body of Christ. The concept of grievances is rooted in the Old Testament, where disputes were often settled within the community (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>). This reflects the biblical principle of seeking reconciliation and peace among God's people.<p><b>how dare he go to law before the unrighteous</b><br>The term "unrighteous" refers to secular courts and judges who do not adhere to Christian values. In the Greco-Roman world, legal disputes were common, and the courts were often seen as corrupt or biased. Paul challenges the Corinthians to consider the spiritual implications of taking their disputes before non-believers, as it could damage the church's witness. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where He instructs believers to resolve conflicts within the church.<p><b>instead of before the saints!</b><br>"Saints" refers to the believers, those set apart by God. Paul emphasizes the authority and wisdom of the church community in handling disputes. The early church functioned as a family, and issues were ideally resolved internally, reflecting the wisdom and guidance of the Holy Spirit. This aligns with the concept of the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>), where each member plays a role in maintaining unity and peace.

Instead, believers are to rely on Spirit-guided brothers and sisters to pursue restoration, forgiveness, and unity, demonstrating to the world the reconciling power of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Dare any of you.</span>--Having rebuked the Corinthian Christians for any attempt to judge those who are outside the Church--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the heathen--St. Paul now insists, on the other hand, on the importance of their not submitting their affairs for decision to the heathen tribunals. Jewish converts would have more easily understood that they should settle disputes among themselves, as the Roman power had, as we learn from Gallio's remarks (<a href="/context/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14-15</a>), given this liberty to the Jews. The Gentile converts, however, would have been naturally inclined to continue to bring disputes before the tribunals with which they had been so familiar in a proverbially litigious condition of society before their conversion. We can well imagine how detrimental to the best interests of Christianity it would be for the Christian communion, founded as it was on principles of unity and love, to be perpetually, through the hasty temper and weakness of individual members, held up to the scorn of the heathen, as a scene of intestine strife. Repeated lawsuits before heathen judges would have had the further evil effect of practically obliterating the broad line of demarcation which then really existed between the principles of Roman jurisprudence, and the loftier Christian conceptions of self-sacrifice and charity by which the followers of Jesus Christ should, in accordance with His teaching, control their life. These considerations rendered necessary the warnings which the Apostle here commences with the emphatic word "Dare," of which it has been well said (Bengel), "Treason against Christians is denoted by this high-sounding word."<p><span class= "bld">Unjust . . . . saints.</span>--These words convey here no essentially moral ideas. They merely signify respectively "heathen" and "members of the Christian Church." These phrases remind us that the state of things when St. Paul wrote this was entirely different from what exists in any Christian country now. The teaching has nothing whatever to do with the adjudication of the courts of a Christian country. The cases to which St. Paul's injunctions would be applicable in the present day would be possible only in a heathen country. If, for example, in India there existed heathen tribunals, it would certainly be wrong, and a source of grave scandal, for native Christians to submit questions between themselves for decision to such courts, instead of bringing them before the legal tribunals established by Christian England. It is not probable that at so early a period there were any regular and recognised tribunals amongst the Christians, and certainly their decisions could scarcely have had any legal force. There is, however, historical evidence of the existence of such in the middle of the second century. The principles here laid down would naturally have led to their establishment. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Corinthians 5:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">Litigation before heathen courts forbidden.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dare any of you?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Dare any one of you?</span> It is in St. Paul's view an <span class="accented">audacious</span> defiance of Christian duties to seek from the heathen the justice due from brother to brother. <span class="cmt_word">A matter;</span> some ground of civil dispute. <span class="cmt_word">Against another;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> against another Christian. When one of the litigants was a heathen, Christians were allowed to go before heathen law courts, because no other remedy was possible. <span class="cmt_word">Go to law before the unjust.</span> The "unjust" is here used for "Gentiles," because it at once suggests a reason against the dereliction of Christian duty involved in such a step. How "unjust" the pagans were in the special sense of the word, the Christians of that day had daily opportunities of seeing; and in a more general sense, the Gentiles were "sinners" (<a href="/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>). Even the Jews were bound to settle their civil disputes before their own tribunals. The ideal Jew was <span class="accented">jashar</span>, or "the upright man," and Jews could not consistently seek integrity from those who were not upright. <span class="accented">A fortiori</span>, Christians ought not to do so. <span class="cmt_word">Before the saints.</span> All Christians were ideally "saints," just as the heathen were normally "unjust." If Christians went to law with one another before the heathen, they belied their profession of mutual love, caused scandal, and were almost necessarily tempted into compliance with heathen customs, even to the extent of recognizing idols. Our Lord had already laid down the rule that "brothers" ought to settle their quarrels among themselves (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[If] any</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
