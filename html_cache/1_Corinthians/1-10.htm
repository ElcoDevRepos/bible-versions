The term "brothers" signifies a familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and equality within the body of Christ. This familial language is consistent with Paul's other letters, where he often addresses the church as a family (e.g., <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <a href="/philippians/4.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>).<p><b>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>Paul invokes the authority of Jesus Christ, underscoring the seriousness of his appeal. The name of Jesus carries weight and authority, as seen throughout the New Testament (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). This phrase also highlights the centrality of Christ in the life and unity of the church.<p><b>that all of you agree together</b><br>The call for agreement is a plea for doctrinal and relational harmony. In the context of Corinth, a city known for its diversity and division, this was a significant challenge. The Greek word used here, "katartizo," implies being perfectly joined together, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>, where believers are urged to maintain the unity of the Spirit.<p><b>so that there may be no divisions among you</b><br>Divisions, or "schismata," were a major issue in the Corinthian church, as evidenced by the factions mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>. Paul addresses these divisions throughout the letter, urging the church to focus on their shared faith in Christ rather than personal allegiances.<p><b>and that you may be united in mind and conviction</b><br>Unity in mind and conviction suggests a deep, internal agreement on essential beliefs and purposes. This unity is not merely external but involves a shared understanding and commitment to the gospel. <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a> echoes this call for unity, urging believers to be of the same mind, having the same love, and being in full accord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth with authority and pastoral concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and gifted congregation facing issues of division and discord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in whose name Paul makes his appeal for unity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divisions_in_the_church.htm">Divisions in the Church</a></b><br>The specific issue Paul is addressing, which threatens the unity and witness of the church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_mind_and_conviction.htm">Unity in Mind and Conviction</a></b><br>The desired state Paul urges the Corinthians to achieve, reflecting the harmony intended for the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_unity.htm">The Importance of Unity</a></b><br>Unity is not just a suggestion but a command that reflects the nature of God and the testimony of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_christ_in_unity.htm">The Role of Christ in Unity</a></b><br>Our unity is grounded in our shared faith in Jesus Christ, who is the head of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_divisions.htm">Avoiding Divisions</a></b><br>Divisions can weaken the church's witness and effectiveness; therefore, believers must strive to resolve conflicts and maintain harmony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>While believers may have different gifts and perspectives, they are called to be united in purpose and mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_steps_to_unity.htm">Practical Steps to Unity</a></b><br>Engage in open communication, practice forgiveness, and prioritize the common good over personal preferences.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_1_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_unite_our_church_community.htm">How can we "agree together" to avoid divisions in our church community?

The treatment of this subject occupies to <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1Corinthians 4:20</a>. It is important to remember that the factions rebuked by St. Paul were not sects who separated themselves from the Church, but those who within the Church divided themselves into parties, each calling itself by the name of some Apostle whose teaching and practice were most highly esteemed. The nature and cause of these divisions we shall understand as we consider the Apostle's exhortation to unity, and his rebuke of the spirit which gave rise to them.<p><span class= "bld">By the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--By his previous remark that they had been called unto "the communion" of this Holy Name, the writer has led up to the mention of Christ's name--not in the form of an adjuration, but as reminding them of it. That very name adds strength to his exhortation to "speak the same thing"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to call themselves by this one name, and not each (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>) by a different designation, and that there should be no "schisms" among them. The word translated "divisions," signifies literally a "rent," in which sense it occurs in <a href="/mark/2-21.htm" title="No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.">Mark 2:21</a> ("<span class= "ital">the rent</span> is made worse"), and is used three times in St. John's Gospel in the sense of schism or difference of opinion (<a href="/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>; <a href="/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm" title="There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.">John 10:19</a>). See Note on <a href="/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>, as to the moral application of the word having probably come from Ephesus; and the idea of a tear or rent is carried on in the words, "be perfectly joined together," which in the original signifies the repair of something which was torn, as in <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a> we have the word rendered "<span class= "ital">were mending</span> their nets." The church at Corinth presents to the Apostle's mind the idea of a seamless robe rent and torn into pieces, and he desires its complete and entire restoration by their returning to a united temper of mind and judgment as to word and deed. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - <span class="accented">Party spirit at Corinth.</span> This subject is pursued in various forms to <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>. The particle implies the transition from thanksgiving to reproof. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>. This very title involves an appeal to them to aim at unity among themselves; and St. Paul, like St. James (James 5:10), uses it to soften any austerity which might seem to exist in his language (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> that is, by the whole idea of Christ's being and office - the strongest bond of union between true Christians (see the powerful appeal in <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye all speak the same thing;</span> that is, "that ye may all with one mind and one mouth glorify God" (<a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>). They were doing the very reverse - each glorifying himself and his party (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">Divisions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); "schisms" used of bodies within the Church, not of separatists from it (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>). The word is only used in this special sense in this Epistle. In <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a> and <a href="/mark/2-21.htm">Mark 2:21</a> <span class="accented">schisma</span> means "a rent;" in John (<a href="/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a>; <a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>), "a division of opinion." There would be little or no harm in the <span class="accented">schismata</span> so far as they affected unessential points, if it was not their fatal tendency to end in "contentions" (<span class="accented">erides</span>) and "factions" (<span class="accented">haireseis</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>). Corinth was a place where such divisions would be likely to spring up, partly from the disputatious vivacity and intellectual conceits of the inhabitants, partly from the multitudes of strangers who constantly visited the port, partly from the numerous diversities of previous training through which the various sections of converts had passed. <span class="cmt_word">Perfected together;</span> literally, <span class="accented">repaired, reunited.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In the same mind and in the same judgment</span>; that is, in what they think and believe (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), and in what they assert and do (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>).
