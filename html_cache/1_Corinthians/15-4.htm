In Jewish custom, burial was an essential part of honoring the deceased, and it fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which states that the Messiah would be with the rich in His death. Jesus was buried in a tomb owned by Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin, which aligns with this prophecy. The burial also sets the stage for the resurrection, as it provides a clear transition from death to life. The sealed tomb and the Roman guards (<a href="/matthew/27-65.htm">Matthew 27:65-66</a>) further authenticate the reality of His death and the miraculous nature of His resurrection.<p><b>that He was raised on the third day</b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of Christian faith, as it demonstrates His victory over sin and death. The phrase "on the third day" is significant, as it aligns with Jesus' own predictions (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>, <a href="/luke/24-46.htm">Luke 24:46</a>) and typological foreshadowing in the Old Testament, such as Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>). The third day also holds symbolic meaning in Jewish tradition, often associated with divine intervention and new beginnings. The resurrection is a historical event witnessed by many (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>), providing evidence for the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>according to the Scriptures</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the resurrection was not an unexpected event but was foretold in the Hebrew Scriptures. Passages such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-11</a> hint at the Messiah's victory over death. The phrase underscores the continuity and fulfillment of God's redemptive plan as revealed throughout the Bible. It assures believers that the events of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection were part of God's sovereign design, providing a foundation for faith and hope in the promises of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the Christian faith, whose death, burial, and resurrection are foundational to Christian doctrine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece where the Apostle Paul established a church and to whom this letter was addressed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, who wrote to address issues in the Corinthian church and to affirm the core truths of the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead on the third day, a cornerstone of Christian belief.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scriptures.htm">The Scriptures</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophecies and writings that foretold the death and resurrection of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Certainty of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection is a historical event, affirmed by eyewitnesses and Scripture, providing a foundation for our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' resurrection was "according to the Scriptures," demonstrating God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_gospel.htm">The Power of the Gospel</a></b><br>The resurrection is central to the Gospel message, offering hope and assurance of eternal life to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_resurrection_power.htm">Living in Resurrection Power</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in the power of the resurrection, experiencing victory over sin and death in their daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_the_resurrection.htm">Hope in the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection assures us of our future resurrection and eternal life with Christ, providing hope in times of trial and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_15_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 15:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_15_4_s_proof_of_Christ_s_rising.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 15:4 affirm the truth of Christ's resurrection?

The death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord were all parts of that providential plan which the deep spiritual insight of God's servants of old illumined by the Holy Spirit had enabled them to foresee.
