In the early church, gatherings were often open, allowing for a diverse audience. This openness reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) to make disciples of all nations. The term "uninstructed" suggests individuals who may be new to the faith or unfamiliar with spiritual gifts, emphasizing the importance of teaching and discipleship within the church (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-26</a>).<p><b>while everyone is prophesying</b><br>Prophecy in the New Testament context refers to speaking forth the word of God under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Unlike Old Testament prophecy, which often involved foretelling future events, New Testament prophecy is more about edification, exhortation, and comfort (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>). The communal aspect of "everyone is prophesying" suggests a participatory worship environment, where the Spirit's gifts are actively used for the building up of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7-11</a>).<p><b>he will be convicted</b><br>The conviction mentioned here is a work of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>, where the Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. This conviction is not merely an emotional response but a deep realization of one's spiritual state and need for salvation. The prophetic word, when delivered in truth and love, has the power to reveal the secrets of the heart (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><b>and called to account by all</b><br>This phrase indicates a communal responsibility in the church to uphold truth and righteousness. Being "called to account" suggests a form of spiritual accountability, where the unbeliever or uninstructed person is confronted with the reality of their spiritual condition. This aligns with the biblical principle of mutual edification and correction within the body of Christ (<a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1-2</a>).

Because <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> reminds us that the &#8220;natural man&#8221; does not grasp spiritual things, the church must communicate in ways that reach the heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while everyone is prophesying</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; here is Spirit-prompted, intelligible speech that strengthens, encourages, and comforts (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike tongues without interpretation, prophecy speaks the visitor&#8217;s language.

Conviction rises, accountability dawns, and the door swings open for genuine repentance and faith. That is the power and purpose of orderly, intelligible prophecy in the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">But if all prophesy.</span>--There is no danger of exaggeration regarding this gift. Each one uttering prophecy, telling forth the gospel truth, and revealing the mind of God, will have a message that will be useful to the unbeliever. As one after another they utter the words of divine truth, they each send something that pierces into his soul. By all of them he is convicted in his own conscience of some sin. He is condemned in his own eyes, a searching light is turned upon his heart. The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and he makes terrible discoveries of his guilt (<a href="/context/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All prophesy.</span> If one after another speak the word of spiritual exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">He is convinced of all, he is judged of all;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he is being convicted by all, he is being examined by all</span>; in other words, each address is calculated to awaken conviction in him and to search his heart. Thus the address of St. Peter pierced the consciences of his hearers, when the glossolaly even of Pentecost produced no effect beyond that of irreverent wonder (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>). It is easy to see that the style and method of worship in the assemblies of Christians at this early epoch resembled that now prevalent among Quakers. The teaching was not left to recognized pastors, but any Christian might speak who had gifts which moved him to address his brethren. The externals of worship are of no eternal signifiance, but are best left to be moulded by the requirements of time and place, with reference to the teachings of past experience. No doubt St. Paul's depreciation of glossolaly led to its rapid disappearance when it had done its work of being "a sign to unbelievers." But if ancient modes of worship were too independent of rigid conditions, modern modes are, on the other hand, too stereotyped and inelastic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
