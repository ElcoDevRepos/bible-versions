In the context of the early church, believers were often concerned about whether they needed to change their social or marital status upon conversion. Paul advises against unnecessary changes, promoting a sense of peace and focus on spiritual growth rather than external conditions. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of inner transformation over outward appearances (<a href="/matthew/23-26.htm">Matthew 23:26</a>).<p><b>in the situation</b><br>The term "situation" refers to one's social, economic, or marital status. In the Greco-Roman world, social mobility was limited, and one's status was often seen as divinely appointed. Paul acknowledges these societal structures but encourages believers to prioritize their spiritual calling over societal expectations. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God can work through any circumstance, as seen in Joseph's rise to power in Egypt despite his initial status as a slave (Genesis 39-41).<p><b>he was in</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the idea of divine providence. The circumstances in which a person finds themselves are not accidental but are part of God's sovereign plan. This echoes the Old Testament understanding of God's control over the affairs of men, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps."<p><b>when he was called</b><br>The concept of being "called" refers to the moment of conversion or the realization of one's faith in Christ. This calling is a central theme in Paul's writings, emphasizing that it is God who initiates the relationship with believers (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). The calling is not just to salvation but to a life of service and witness, regardless of one's external circumstances. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which transcends cultural and social barriers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul declares that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diverse population and moral challenges.

"Calling" must not here be regarded in the modern sense of profession or condition in life; it is nowhere so used in the New Testament, but always signifies God's calling of us. (See <a href="/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>.) Continue to be Christians of the kind which God's call to Christianity made you. If you were circumcised--and so God's call into the Christian Church made you a circumcised Christian--continue so; don't do anything which would seem to imply that some other change in addition to your "call" was necessary to complete your admission to the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let every man abide in the same calling,</span> etc. In accordance with this general principle, which illustrates the distinction between Christianity and violent social revolutions, St. John the Baptist had not bidden publicans or soldiers to abandon their callings, but to do their duty in that state of life to which God had called them (<a href="/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-14</a>).
