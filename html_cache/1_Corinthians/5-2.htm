This pride could be linked to their misunderstanding of Christian liberty or a false sense of spiritual maturity. In the broader context of 1 Corinthians, Paul frequently addresses issues of arrogance and self-sufficiency (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18-19</a>). Pride is often condemned in Scripture as it leads to a lack of repentance and humility before God (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>Shouldn&#8217;t you rather have been stricken with grief</b><br>Paul contrasts their pride with the appropriate response of mourning over sin. Grief over sin is a recurring biblical theme, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance (<a href="/james/4-9.htm">James 4:9</a>). The Greek term used here suggests a deep, emotional sorrow, akin to mourning a death, highlighting the gravity of the situation. This aligns with the biblical call to mourn over sin as seen in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>).<p><b>and have removed from your fellowship the man who did this?</b><br>Paul instructs the church to remove the unrepentant sinner from their midst, a practice known as church discipline. This is consistent with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where He outlines the process for addressing sin within the church. The purpose of such removal is both to protect the purity of the church and to encourage the sinner to repent. Historically, the early church took communal purity seriously, understanding the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>) and the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>). This action also reflects the Old Testament practice of removing sin from the community to maintain holiness (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with authority and concern for their spiritual well-being.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A Christian community in Corinth, known for its diversity and challenges, including moral and ethical issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_immoral_man.htm">The Immoral Man</a></b><br>A member of the Corinthian church involved in a grievous sin, specifically sexual immorality, which Paul addresses directly.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral decadence, providing a challenging environment for the early church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/church_discipline.htm">Church Discipline</a></b><br>The event or action Paul is advocating for, emphasizing the need for the church to address sin within its community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride_in_the_church.htm">The Danger of Pride in the Church</a></b><br>Pride can blind a community to its own sinfulness.

We have instances of similar sentences beginning with "and," <a href="/luke/10-29.htm" title="But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?">Luke 10:29</a>. The Apostle cannot mean that they actually gloried in this act of sin, but that their temper of mind was of that kind which he has already described in the earlier chapters, puffing themselves up, one against another, in party rivalry, instead of being united in one common grief by this common cause, which would lead them as one man to remove from among them the person who had done this deed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye are puffed up;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">And have</span> ye <span class="accented">been puffed up?</span> The "ye," being expressed m the Greek, is emphatic - "ye, the very persons whose horror ought to have been most intense." It might seem inconceivable that any community calling itself Christian would fall so low as to be puffed up at the existence of such an offence among them. There is, indeed, a subtle and close connection between arrogance and sensuality, and beth are sometimes fatally linked to the conceit of religious knowledge without the reality. But not even a heathen community could have been "puffed up" on such grounds. Yet the Corinthians may have been "puffed up" with the conceited reasons which induced them to leave the offence unrebuked, because they boasted the possession of some spurious "knowledge." Perhaps they bad seized some deadly notion of antinomian liberty, such as has existed at times among Gnostic sects, like the Ophites in ancient and the Anabaptists in modern days. Perhaps they sheltered themselves under the arrogant Jewish rule that all a man's conditions of life were altered by becoming a proselyte - that old relationships were for him entirely abolished; for the Jews held that a prosolyte was like "a newborn child," and had begun life a second time (Bechoroth, f. 47, 1), and might marry any of his relatives. Such miserable sophisms would acquire fresh force from the universal impurity with which Corinthian society was stained, and which rendered it necessary for St. Paul in these Epistles to utter his most solemn warnings against every kind of sensuality (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15-18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>:83, 34; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, etc.). But besides all this, St. Paul's remark does not necessarily mean that their "inflation" was exclusively connected with Gnostic excesses, which bore on the case of this offender. It may mean, "Here is a gross fault in the midst of you, and yet - not <span class="accented">propter</span> <span class="accented">hoc</span>, but <span class="accented">cum hoc</span> - the characteristic of your religious factions is pride and conceit." This was indeed <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to play the Corinthian," in the worst sense, of that proverbial taunt. Possibly the prominence or wealth of the offender may have led to a more easy condonation of his crime. Exculpatory sophism may have been suggested by self interest. <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order that, as a result of your godly sorrow, the offender might be removed from your midst. <span class="cmt_word">He that hath done this deed.</span> The language of St. Paul, as always, is as delicate as clearness would allow. The fact that the verb is in the past aorist may perhaps allow us to <span class="accented">hope</span> that the offence, at any rate in its most aggravated forms, had ceased to be committed. The manner of the crime ("in such a way") seems to have been an aggravation of the crime itself. In this indignant verse we have, as Stanley says, "the burst of the storm, the mutterings of which had been heard in the earlier chapters." So intense was the effect produced by St. Paul's stern severity, that a great part of the Second Epistle had to be devoted to allaying the agitation which these words had excited (see especially <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
