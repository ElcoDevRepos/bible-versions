He was entrusted with significant responsibilities in the early church, including leadership roles in Ephesus. His potential visit to Corinth indicates the trust Paul placed in him. Timothy's travels are part of the missionary journeys that spread Christianity throughout the Roman Empire, highlighting the interconnectedness of early Christian communities.<p><b>see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you</b><br>Paul's instruction reflects the challenges Timothy might face in Corinth, a city known for its moral and spiritual challenges. The church in Corinth had issues with division and immorality, which could pose a threat to Timothy's mission. This phrase underscores the importance of providing support and protection for church leaders, a principle seen throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, which calls for obedience and submission to leaders.<p><b>for he is doing the work of the Lord</b><br>Timothy's work is equated with the work of the Lord, emphasizing the divine calling and authority behind his mission. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations. Timothy's role is a continuation of this mission, highlighting the ongoing nature of God's work through His servants.<p><b>just as I am</b><br>Paul draws a parallel between his work and Timothy's, reinforcing Timothy's authority and the legitimacy of his mission. This connection to Paul, an apostle chosen by Christ, lends weight to Timothy's efforts and encourages the Corinthians to respect and support him. It also reflects the unity and shared purpose among early Christian leaders, as seen in other partnerships like Paul and Barnabas in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young disciple and companion of Paul, known for his sincere faith and dedication to the ministry.

Timothy was no stranger to the Corinthians; Paul had introduced him earlier as &#8220;my beloved and faithful child in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>). Like the servant in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, Timothy was dispatched to strengthen believers:<p>&#8226; Godly leaders are gifts to local churches (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Welcoming them expresses obedience to Christ (<a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>see to it</b><p>&#8220;See to it&#8221; places responsibility squarely on the congregation.

In doing so they honor Christ, strengthen their fellowship, and advance the gospel without hindrance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Now if Timotheus come . . .</span>--Timothy and Erastus had been sent (see <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>) by St. Paul to remind the Corinthians of his former teaching, and to rebuke and check those evils of which rumours had reached the ears of the Apostle. As, however, they would travel through Macedonia, delaying <span class= "ital">en route</span> at the various churches to prepare them for the visit which St. Paul, according to his then intention, purposed paying them after he had been to Corinth, they possibly might not reach Corinth until after this Epistle, which would be carried thither by a more direct route. The Apostle was evidently anxious to know how Timothy would be received by the Corinthians. He was young in years. He was young also in the faith. He had probably a constitutionally weak and timid nature (see <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>), and he was of course officially very subordinate to St. Paul. In a Church, therefore, some of whose members had gone so far as to question, if not actually to repudiate the authority even of the Apostle himself, and to depreciate him as compared with the elder Apostles, there was considerable danger for one like Timothy. By reminding the Corinthians of the work in which Timothy is engaged, and of its identity with his own work, the Apostle anticipates and protests against any insult being offered to Timothy, because of what a great English statesman once called, in reference to himself, "the atrocious crime of being a young man."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now if Timotheus come.</span> St. Paul bad already sent on Timothy (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>), with Erastus (<a href="/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), to go to Corinth by way of Macedonia, and prepare for his visit. But possibly he had <span class="accented">countermanded</span> these directions when he postponed his own visit.
