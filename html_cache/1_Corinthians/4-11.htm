This phrase underscores the continuous and present reality of their struggles, reflecting the dedication and perseverance required in their ministry. It highlights the apostles' endurance and commitment to spreading the Gospel despite ongoing challenges.<p><b>we are hungry and thirsty</b><br>The apostles often faced physical deprivation as they traveled to preach the Gospel. This phrase reflects the literal hunger and thirst they experienced, which is reminiscent of Jesus' own fasting and reliance on God (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual hunger and thirst for righteousness (<a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>), illustrating their deep desire to fulfill God's mission.<p><b>we are poorly clothed</b><br>This indicates the lack of material wealth and comfort in the apostles' lives. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, clothing was a status symbol, and being poorly clothed would signify low social standing. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where He instructs His followers not to worry about clothing, emphasizing reliance on God's provision.<p><b>we are brutally treated</b><br>The apostles faced persecution and physical abuse for their faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>. This phrase highlights the hostility they encountered, similar to the sufferings of Christ (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>). It serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the reality of suffering for the sake of the Gospel.<p><b>we are homeless</b><br>The apostles often traveled without a permanent residence, relying on the hospitality of others (<a href="/matthew/10-11.htm">Matthew 10:11-14</a>). This reflects Jesus' own statement in <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a> about having no place to lay His head.

The apostles&#8217; hardships are ongoing, not past tense. He wants the Corinthians to grasp that faithful ministry still costs something in real time (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-30.htm">1 Corinthians 15:30-31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4-5</a>). Their trials prove that genuine apostolic service remains a daily, lived-out sacrifice&#8212;one that spotlights Christ&#8217;s power, not human comfort (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are hungry and thirsty</b><p>Physical deprivation is part of the package. Like his Lord, Paul often lacked basic necessities (<a href="/luke/9-58.htm">Luke 9:58</a>). Yet he learned to be content &#8220;in any and every situation&#8230; whether well fed or hungry&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-12.htm">Philippians 4:12-13</a>). This lack is not failure; it is evidence that the gospel worker depends on God&#8217;s provision rather than worldly security (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>). Such dependency keeps the message pure and the motive clear (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are poorly clothed</b><p>The apostles&#8217; wardrobe reflected their circumstances&#8212;threadbare and practical, not polished and impressive (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>). Their appearance stood in stark contrast to Corinth&#8217;s status-conscious culture. <a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a> reminds us that God often chooses those who are &#8220;poor in the eyes of the world&#8221; to be &#8220;rich in faith.&#8221; Their simple attire underscored that spiritual riches, not outward trappings, mark true servants of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are brutally treated</b><p>The word picture moves from hardship to outright hostility. Beatings, imprisonments, and public shame dogged Paul&#8217;s steps (<a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-24</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>). Jesus had foretold that His followers would be hated for His name (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>). Far from discouraging the apostles, persecution validated their mission and displayed God&#8217;s sustaining grace (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>; <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are homeless</b><p>&#8220;Homeless&#8221; here conveys more than occasional travel; it means having no place to settle, no permanent address (<a href="/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-24</a>). Like Abraham, they lived &#8220;as strangers on earth,&#8221; looking for the city God has prepared (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>). Their willingness to stay mobile kept them free to take the gospel wherever the Spirit led, mirroring Jesus&#8217; own earthly path (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11</a> pulls back the curtain on authentic apostolic life: continuous hardship, material lack, mistreatment, and rootlessness. Far from diminishing their credibility, these realities heighten it. They show that the apostles rely wholly on Christ, not comfort; on heavenly reward, not earthly acclaim. For us, the verse is a sober reminder that faithful ministry may cost dearly, yet every cost proclaims the surpassing worth of knowing and serving Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">We both hunger.</span>--From the strong irony of the last verse, the Apostle here passes, in the pathethic and sad description which occupies <a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;">1Corinthians 4:11-13</a>, to show how intensely true that last word "despised" was, as expressing his own position, not only in time past, but at the very hour of his writing.
