In the cultural context of Corinth, where sexual immorality was prevalent, Paul underscores the sanctity and exclusivity of the marital bond. This aligns with the biblical teaching found in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man and woman become one flesh, highlighting the importance of mutual fulfillment and unity in marriage.<p><b>except by mutual consent</b><br>Paul introduces the idea of agreement between spouses, which reflects the biblical principle of unity and partnership in marriage. This mutual consent is crucial, as it ensures that both partners are in agreement and that one does not impose their will on the other. This principle of agreement is echoed in <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>, which asks, "Can two walk together unless they are agreed?"<p><b>and for a time</b><br>The temporary nature of this separation is emphasized, suggesting that any abstention should not be indefinite. This reflects the understanding that marriage is a continuous partnership and that prolonged separation could lead to issues. The temporary aspect is also a reminder of the need for balance in spiritual and physical aspects of life, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven.<p><b>so you may devote yourselves to prayer</b><br>The purpose of the temporary abstention is spiritual, allowing couples to focus on prayer. This reflects the biblical principle of prioritizing one's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, which encourages seeking first the kingdom of God. The early church often engaged in prayer and fasting as a means of seeking divine guidance and strength, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>.<p><b>Then come together again</b><br>Paul advises that after the period of prayer, couples should reunite. This reunion reinforces the importance of the marital bond and the physical aspect of marriage. It reflects the biblical teaching that marriage is a gift from God, meant to be enjoyed and cherished, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18-19</a>, which celebrates the joy of marital love.<p><b>so that Satan will not tempt you</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the reality of spiritual warfare and the enemy's desire to exploit weaknesses. By reuniting, couples protect themselves from temptation. This aligns with the biblical teaching in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, which instructs believers to put on the full armor of God to stand against the devil's schemes.<p><b>through your lack of self-control</b><br>Paul highlights the human tendency towards weakness and the need for self-control, a fruit of the Spirit as mentioned in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. The acknowledgment of human frailty serves as a reminder of the need for reliance on God's strength and the importance of maintaining a strong marital relationship to guard against temptation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on various issues, including marriage and sexual relations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The institution of marriage is a central theme in this chapter, with Paul offering advice on marital relations and responsibilities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>Mentioned as a tempter, highlighting the spiritual warfare aspect of marital relations and the need for vigilance against temptation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/mutual_consent_in_marriage.htm">Mutual Consent in Marriage</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in marital relations, highlighting the need for communication and agreement between spouses.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prayer_and_fasting.htm">The Role of Prayer and Fasting</a></b><br>Temporary abstinence from marital relations is permissible for prayer and fasting, indicating the importance of spiritual disciplines in marriage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_temptation.htm">Guarding Against Temptation</a></b><br>The warning against Satan's temptations serves as a reminder to be vigilant and proactive in protecting the sanctity of marriage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reconciliation.htm">The Importance of Reconciliation</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s advice implies the importance of reconciliation and coming together after a period of abstinence, reinforcing unity in marriage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_spiritual_and_physical_needs.htm">Balancing Spiritual and Physical Needs</a></b><br>The passage teaches the balance between spiritual pursuits and physical needs, encouraging couples to prioritize both aspects in their relationship.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_7_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 7:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_7_5_on_marital_intimacy_balance.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 7:5 guide marital intimacy and spiritual discipline balance?

(See <a href="/exodus/19-15.htm" title="And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm" title="And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.">1Samuel 21:4</a>.) The alteration in the Greek text of the word "give<span class= "ital">"</span> into the present tense, so as to make the word "prayer" refer to daily devotions, and not to special and exceptional seasons, and the interpolation of the word "fasting"--not found in the older MSS.--are a striking example of how the ascetic tendencies of a particular ecclesiastical school of thought led to their "amending" the sacred text so as to make it be in harmony with their own views, instead of reverently regarding it as that by which those very views should be corrected.<p><span class= "bld">And come together again.</span>--Better (as in the best MSS.), <span class= "ital">and be together again.</span> This is still an explanation of the purpose of the separation, not to be a lasting one, but that we may again return to the state of union. The text here bears further traces of having been altered so as to make it seem that the Apostle meant that the return to matrimonial life should be only to a temporary union, and not to a continuous state of life. The proper reading implies the latter, the word "be" being used as in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm" title="And all that believed were together, and had all things common;">Acts 2:44</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For your incontinency.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">because of your incontinency;</span> the reference being, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1Corinthians 7:2</a>, to the moral condition surrounding them, and to the influence to which a man thus separated would be subject. The Corinthian Christians are here solemnly reminded that this sin, as all sin, is from Satan--because the Corinthians at large did not regard it as sin at all, but even mingled sensuality with worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Defraud ye not.</span> St. Paul purposely leaves the expression general. Primarily he is thinking of "the due" or "the power" which each has over the other, as is shown by the next verse; but he does not confine the expression to this. <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> it be; literally, <span class="accented">unless by chance.</span> The exception he regards as something possible, but not normal. <span class="cmt_word">For a time.</span> By this and the next words he disparages, by anticipation, the celibate and separate married lives which, in a corrupt age, were so much and so unwisely admired in the ascetic saints of the Middle Ages. Temporary separation for special reasons had been recognized from the earliest times (<a href="/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye may give yourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">ye may have leisure.</span> The verb is in the aorist, which shows that the "leisure" contemplated was for brief periods, not during continuous years. It was altered to the <span class="accented">present</span> by the officious copyists, who believed in external and mechanical rules of holiness. <span class="cmt_word">To fasting and prayer.</span> "Fasting" is an ascetic interpolation, not found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F. On this interpolation, and perhaps on the analogy of the rule given by Moses at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>), rose the practice of married persons living apart at Lent (Stanley). <span class="cmt_word">Come together again.</span> The prepossessions of ascetic scribes have again tampered with the text. The true reading is, "be together again" (<span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), not "come together" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For your incontinency;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of.</span> Their past lives and their present temptations were a warning that they could not lay on themselves burdens which God did not require. They should not strive <p><span class="accented">"...to wind themsleves to high<br />For sinful man beneath the sky."</span> Violent, unnatural, self tormenting, repressions beyond what God demands, and adopted without reference to the strength or the circumstances of individual natures, only tend, as all ascetics have confessed, to increase rather than to diminish the force of sensual temptations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
