This area included cities like Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamum, which are also mentioned in Revelation. The churches in Asia were established during Paul's missionary journeys, and their greeting signifies the unity and fellowship among early Christian communities. This reflects the interconnectedness of the early church, emphasizing the importance of mutual support and encouragement among believers, as seen in other epistles like <a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>.<p><b>Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord,</b><br>Aquila and Prisca (also known as Priscilla) were a Jewish Christian couple who played a crucial role in the early church. They were tentmakers by trade, like Paul, and had previously lived in Rome before being expelled by Emperor Claudius. Their mention here highlights their ongoing commitment to the ministry and their close relationship with Paul. They are noted for their theological understanding and teaching, as seen in <a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>, where they instruct Apollos. Their greeting "in the Lord" underscores the spiritual bond and shared faith that transcends geographical distances.<p><b>and so does the church that meets at their house.</b><br>House churches were common in the early Christian era due to the lack of formal church buildings. Aquila and Prisca's home served as a meeting place for believers, indicating their leadership and hospitality. This practice of meeting in homes is seen throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a> and <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>, and reflects the intimate and communal nature of early Christian worship.
