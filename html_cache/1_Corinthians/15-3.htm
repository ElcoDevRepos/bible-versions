Paul emphasizes that the message he is delivering is not of his own invention but something he received, likely through revelation and instruction from other apostles (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>). The phrase "of first importance" underscores the foundational nature of the gospel message. In the early church, oral tradition was crucial for preserving teachings before the New Testament was fully written and compiled. This reflects the Jewish tradition of passing down teachings through generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>.<p><b>that Christ died for our sins</b><br>This statement is central to Christian doctrine, affirming the sacrificial death of Jesus as atonement for humanity's sins. The concept of substitutionary atonement is rooted in the Old Testament sacrificial system, particularly the sin offerings described in Leviticus. The death of Christ fulfills the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bears the iniquities of many. The phrase also connects to the Passover lamb (Exodus 12), a type of Christ, symbolizing deliverance from sin and death.<p><b>according to the Scriptures,</b><br>This phrase asserts that Christ's death was in fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and not a random event. Scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> provide detailed descriptions of the suffering and purpose of the Messiah's death. The phrase indicates the continuity and consistency of God's redemptive plan throughout the Bible. It also reflects the early Christian practice of interpreting Jesus' life and mission through the lens of Hebrew Scriptures, affirming the divine inspiration and authority of the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and to affirm the core truths of the Christian faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the Messiah who died for the sins of humanity, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event of Jesus Christ's death on the cross, which is the focal point of the gospel message Paul is emphasizing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scriptures.htm">The Scriptures</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophecies and writings that foretold the coming of the Messiah and His sacrificial death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_primacy_of_the_gospel.htm">The Primacy of the Gospel</a></b><br>The message of Christ's death for our sins is of "first importance."
