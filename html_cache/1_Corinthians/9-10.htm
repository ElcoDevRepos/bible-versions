In the broader context of <a href="/1_corinthians/9.htm">1 Corinthians 9</a>, Paul defends the rights of apostles to receive material support from the church. The principle of God speaking on behalf of His people is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-10</a>, where God hears the cries of the Israelites and acts on their behalf. This phrase underscores the divine principle of provision and care for those who labor in ministry.<p><b>Indeed, this was written for us,</b><br>Paul refers to the Old Testament law, specifically <a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, which states, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." This law, while literally about animals, is applied by Paul to human workers, showing the timeless principle of fair compensation. The phrase "for us" indicates that the Scriptures have enduring relevance and were intended to instruct and guide believers in all ages, highlighting the continuity between the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes,</b><br>This imagery of agricultural work is common in biblical texts, reflecting the agrarian society of ancient Israel. Plowing and threshing are essential steps in the process of food production, symbolizing hard work and diligence. The use of these terms connects the physical labor of farming with spiritual labor in ministry, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, where Jesus speaks of the harvest being plentiful but the workers few.<p><b>they should also expect to share in the harvest.</b><br>This principle of sharing in the fruits of one's labor is rooted in justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, which commands fair wages for workers. The expectation of sharing in the harvest is a metaphor for the spiritual and material rewards that come from faithful service. It also points to the eschatological hope of believers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which encourages perseverance with the promise of reaping a harvest if we do not give up. This reflects the ultimate reward for those who labor in God's kingdom, both in this life and the life to come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on Christian living and ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant trade, where the early church faced various challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a community of believers navigating issues of doctrine, morality, and unity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_testament_law.htm">Old Testament Law</a></b><br>Paul references principles from the Old Testament, particularly Deuteronomy, to illustrate his point about labor and reward.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/agricultural_imagery.htm">Agricultural Imagery</a></b><br>Paul uses the metaphor of plowing and threshing, common agricultural practices, to convey spiritual truths about labor and reward.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_fair_compensation.htm">Principle of Fair Compensation</a></b><br>Just as workers in the field expect to share in the harvest, those who labor in ministry should be supported by the community they serve.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_and_material_support.htm">Spiritual and Material Support</a></b><br>The church is called to provide for the material needs of its leaders, recognizing their spiritual contributions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/labor_with_expectation.htm">Labor with Expectation</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to work diligently in their spiritual and earthly endeavors, trusting that God will provide a harvest in due time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/biblical_foundation_for_support.htm">Biblical Foundation for Support</a></b><br>The principle of supporting those who labor is deeply rooted in Scripture, both in the Old and New Testaments, affirming its importance in the life of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The church community has a responsibility to care for its leaders, ensuring they can focus on their spiritual duties without undue financial burden.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_9_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 9:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_9_10_How_does_it_inspire_hope.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 9:10 encourage us to work with hope and purpose?

Both are strenuous, essential, and prolonged; each illustrates different aspects of ministry.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/2-6.htm">2 Timothy 2:6</a> calls the hardworking farmer &#8220;the first to partake of the crops,&#8221; connecting physical and spiritual labor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a> applies the principle directly: &#8220;The one who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.&#8221;<p>By likening gospel work to the entire farming process, Paul highlights the ongoing effort required to plant truth, nurture growth, and prepare a harvest of souls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they should also expect to share in the harvest</b><p>Expectation is not greed; it is the God-given right of the laborer.

The law was written with believers in mind, affirming that diligent ministry parallels the farmer&#8217;s effort and rightly shares in the harvest it produces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">That he that ploweth should plow in hope.</span>--There is considerable variation in the MSS. here. The best rendering of the text is, <span class= "ital">that the plougher</span> <span class= "ital">is bound to plough in hope, and the thresher </span>(<span class= "ital">to thresh</span>)<span class= "ital"> in the hope of having his share.</span> It has been much discussed whether this passage is to be taken literally as referring to actual ploughing and threshing, or whether we are to give them a spiritual significance. I think it is, perhaps, best to take them literally, as expressing the sanction given by God in the legal provision previously mentioned to the divine principle which unites earthly labour and reward; and the argument, of course, is that this principle applies <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> to the higher work of a spiritual nature; and this application is brought out clearly in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Altogether.</span> It is probable that St. Paul only meant the word to be taken argumentatively, and not <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre.</span> This application (he says) is so obviously <span class="accented">the</span> right application, that the other may be set aside as far as our purpose is concerned. In the margin of the Revised Version it is rendered "Saith he it, as <span class="accented">he doubtless doth</span>, for our sake?" <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">hope.</span> St. Paul's large experience of life, and his insight into character, sufficed to show him that despairing work must be ineffectual work. The spring and elasticity of cheerful spirits is indispensable to success in any arduous undertaking. <p><span class="accented">"Life without hope draws nectar in a sieve,<br />And hope without an object cannot live."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Isn&#8217;t</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7970;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2228.htm">Strong's 2228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, than.
