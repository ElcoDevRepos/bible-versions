However, without an interpreter, the message could not edify the congregation. This reflects the principle that spiritual gifts should be used for the common good (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>). The need for an interpreter underscores the importance of understanding and clarity in worship, aligning with the broader biblical theme that God is not a God of confusion but of peace (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><b>he should remain silent in the church</b><br>This directive emphasizes order and propriety in worship services. The early church gatherings were often held in homes or small community spaces, where maintaining order was crucial for effective worship and teaching. The instruction to remain silent if there is no interpreter ensures that the focus remains on edification and understanding, rather than on individual expression that could lead to disorder (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><b>and speak only to himself and God</b><br>This phrase highlights the personal nature of prayer and communication with God. It suggests that while the gift of tongues is valuable, it is primarily for personal edification when not interpreted (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>). This private communication with God reflects the intimate relationship believers are encouraged to cultivate, as seen in Jesus' teaching on prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>, where He instructs to pray in private.
