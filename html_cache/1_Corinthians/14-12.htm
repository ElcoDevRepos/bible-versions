The Corinthian believers were known for their enthusiasm for spiritual experiences, but Paul emphasizes the need for order and edification. This phrase connects to the broader theme of unity and love in the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12-13</a>, where Paul discusses the diversity of gifts and the supremacy of love.<p><b>Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts,</b><br>The Corinthians were zealous for spiritual manifestations, particularly the more spectacular gifts like speaking in tongues. This eagerness reflects the cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its diversity and fascination with spiritual phenomena. Paul acknowledges their desire but redirects their focus towards a more constructive use of these gifts. This eagerness is reminiscent of the early church's experiences in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit's outpouring was accompanied by various gifts.<p><b>strive to excel in gifts that build up the church.</b><br>Paul encourages the Corinthians to prioritize gifts that edify the church community, such as prophecy, teaching, and wisdom. This instruction aligns with the overarching biblical principle of love and service to others, as highlighted in <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>. The emphasis on building up the church reflects the New Testament's focus on the church as the body of Christ, where each member plays a vital role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This call to edification is also seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-16</a>, where the purpose of spiritual gifts is to equip the saints and build up the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Believers are encouraged to focus on how their gifts can serve and build up others rather than seeking personal recognition or status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eagerness_for_gifts.htm">Eagerness for Gifts</a></b><br>While it is good to desire spiritual gifts, the motivation should be to contribute positively to the community of believers. This aligns with the Greek word (zelotai), meaning to be zealous or eager, but with the right intent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strive_for_excellence.htm">Strive for Excellence</a></b><br>The Greek word (perisseuete) implies an abundance or excelling.

This reflects the body metaphor Paul uses in <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_the_foundation.htm">Love as the Foundation</a></b><br>As emphasized in <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, love should be the foundation of all actions and the use of spiritual gifts.
