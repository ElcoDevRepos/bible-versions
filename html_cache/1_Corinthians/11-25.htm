The Passover context is significant as it commemorates the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, and Jesus is now instituting a new deliverance through His sacrifice. The "cup" here is one of the four cups traditionally consumed during the Passover Seder, likely the third cup, known as the "Cup of Redemption." This act of taking the cup after supper aligns with the Jewish customs of the time, emphasizing the fulfillment of the Old Covenant and the establishment of the New Covenant.<p><b>&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in My blood;</b><br>The "new covenant" refers to the promise of a renewed relationship between God and humanity, prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. This covenant is not based on the law but on grace, made possible through the sacrificial death of Jesus. The mention of "My blood" signifies the sacrificial nature of this covenant, echoing the blood of the lambs in the original Passover, which protected the Israelites from the angel of death. Jesus' blood, therefore, is the means by which believers are redeemed and forgiven, fulfilling the typology of the Passover lamb.<p><b>do this, as often as you drink it,</b><br>This command establishes the practice of communion or the Lord's Supper as a regular observance for believers. The phrase "as often as you drink it" suggests that this is not a one-time event but a continual practice, allowing the church to regularly remember and proclaim the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. The frequency is not specified, allowing for flexibility in practice among different Christian traditions.<p><b>in remembrance of Me.&#8221;</b><br>The act of remembrance is central to the Christian faith, serving as a reminder of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. This remembrance is not merely a mental exercise but a spiritual participation in the benefits of Christ's sacrifice. It connects believers to the historical event of the crucifixion and its ongoing spiritual significance. This phrase also ties back to the Jewish tradition of remembering God's past acts of salvation, now centered on the ultimate act of salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who institutes the Lord's Supper and establishes the new covenant through His sacrifice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>Present at the Last Supper, they are the initial recipients of this command and are tasked with continuing this practice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The event where Jesus shares the Passover meal with His disciples and introduces the new covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the church addressed in this letter is located, known for its diverse and often morally challenging environment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, who is addressing issues within the Corinthian church, including the proper observance of the Lord's Supper.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_new_covenant.htm">The Significance of the New Covenant</a></b><br>The new covenant signifies a transformative relationship with God, established through Jesus' sacrificial death.
