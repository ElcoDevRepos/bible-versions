In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>, Paul addresses the use of tongues and prophecy in the church. The question implies a need for balance and order in worship, emphasizing edification over personal experience. This aligns with the broader theme of 1 Corinthians, where Paul seeks to correct misunderstandings and misuses of spiritual gifts.<p><b>I will pray with my spirit,</b><br>Praying with the spirit refers to praying in tongues, a spiritual gift that Paul acknowledges as valuable for personal edification (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>). This type of prayer is characterized by a deep, spiritual connection with God, transcending human language. It reflects the believer's intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>, where the Spirit intercedes with groanings too deep for words.<p><b>but I will also pray with my mind.</b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of understanding in prayer. Praying with the mind involves using one's intellect and comprehension, ensuring that prayer is not only a spiritual exercise but also an act of conscious worship. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>, where believers are called to love God with all their heart, soul, and mind. It underscores the need for clarity and edification in corporate worship, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>.<p><b>I will sing with my spirit,</b><br>Singing with the spirit can be likened to singing in tongues or engaging in spontaneous, Spirit-led worship. This form of singing is an expression of joy and connection with God, reminiscent of <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>, where believers are encouraged to sing and make music in their hearts to the Lord. It highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in inspiring worship that transcends human limitations.<p><b>but I will also sing with my mind.</b><br>Singing with the mind involves using one's understanding and intellect in worship. This ensures that songs are doctrinally sound and edifying to the congregation. <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a> emphasizes the importance of teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, indicating that worship should be both spiritually enriching and intellectually engaging. This balance reflects the holistic nature of worship, engaging both the spirit and the mind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Faced with that tension, he answers his own question with a balanced plan. The phrase signals:<p>&#8226; A personal resolve&#8212;Paul owns responsibility for edifying worship, echoing <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23-24</a>.<p>&#8226; A model for every believer&#8212;&#8220;Shall I&#8221; becomes &#8220;shall we,&#8221; inviting the church to follow his example (<a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; An immediate application&#8212;he is not theorizing; he is prescribing conduct for the next gathering (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will pray with my spirit</b><p>Here Paul refers to prayer empowered by the Holy Spirit, often expressed in tongues (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2</a>). He refuses to suppress this gift because:<p>&#8226; The Spirit intercedes &#8220;with groans too deep for words&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>), building the inner man (Jude 20).<p>&#8226; Private devotion fuels public ministry; Jesus withdrew to pray before serving crowds (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35-38</a>).<p>&#8226; Spirit-led prayer keeps worship God-centered, aligning with &#8220;pray in the Spirit on all occasions&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I will also pray with my mind</b><p>Intelligible prayer completes the picture. Paul insists that:<p>&#8226; Understanding shapes petitions that others can affirm&#8212;&#8220;Amen&#8221; requires comprehension (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The mind is not the enemy of the Spirit; both are gifts meant to work together (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Clear words teach and comfort the body, mirroring Ezra&#8217;s practice of reading &#8220;making the meaning clear&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>).<p>Thus, Spirit and mind are not rivals but partners in prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will sing with my spirit</b><p>Singing in the Spirit lifts praise beyond the limits of vocabulary, much like the new song celebrated in <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>.

Prayer and praise should flow from the deepest part of our being yet remain understandable so the whole church is built up. Rather than choosing between emotion and intellect, God invites us to employ both, bringing Him worship that is alive in the Spirit and anchored in truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">What is it then?</span>--The Apostle, in answering this question--viz., What, then, is the practical conclusion of the whole matter?--still speaks in the first person, quoting his own conduct and resolution. He will not let his public ministrations as regards prayer and praise evaporate into mere enthusiasm; nor will he, on the other hand, allow a cold intellectual creed to chill and freeze the warm emotions of the spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is it then?</span> A phrase like the Latin <span class="accented">quorsum haec?</span> What is the purport of my exhortations?
