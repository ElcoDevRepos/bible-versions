The emphasis on the "whole church" suggests a communal worship setting, reflecting the unity and collective identity of believers. This gathering is reminiscent of <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early church devoted themselves to fellowship and teaching. The concept of the church as a body is further elaborated in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, emphasizing the importance of each member's role.<p><b>and everyone speaks in tongues</b><br>Speaking in tongues, or glossolalia, was a spiritual gift mentioned in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12-14</a>. It involved speaking in languages unknown to the speaker, often seen as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence. However, Paul addresses the potential for disorder if everyone speaks in tongues simultaneously, as it could lead to confusion rather than edification. This reflects the need for orderly worship, as outlined in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>, where God is described as a God of peace, not disorder.<p><b>and some who are uninstructed or some unbelievers come in</b><br>The "uninstructed" refers to those not fully taught in Christian doctrine, possibly new converts or seekers. "Unbelievers" are those who do not yet accept the Christian faith. The presence of such individuals in the assembly highlights the early church's evangelistic nature, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>, where the Lord added to their number daily. This scenario underscores the importance of making worship accessible and understandable to outsiders.<p><b>will they not say that you are out of your minds?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to the potential misunderstanding and negative impression that chaotic worship could create. The phrase "out of your minds" suggests a perception of irrationality or madness, which could hinder the church's witness. This concern for the church's reputation and the clarity of its message is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>, where believers are urged to live such good lives among the pagans that they may see their good deeds and glorify God. The need for intelligibility in worship is a recurring theme in <a href="/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>, emphasizing prophecy over tongues for the edification of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on spiritual gifts and orderly worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation facing issues of disorder and misunderstanding in worship practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uninstructed_individuals.htm">Uninstructed Individuals</a></b><br>Those within the church who may not fully understand the practice of speaking in tongues or its purpose.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelievers.htm">Unbelievers</a></b><br>Non-Christians who might visit the church and witness the practice of speaking in tongues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/speaking_in_tongues.htm">Speaking in Tongues</a></b><br>A spiritual gift involving speaking in languages unknown to the speaker, intended for edification when interpreted.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/order_in_worship.htm">Order in Worship</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of order in worship to ensure that all practices are edifying and understandable to both believers and visitors.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_spiritual_gifts.htm">Purpose of Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>Spiritual gifts, including tongues, are given for the edification of the church.
