The concept of judging angels is not extensively detailed in Scripture, but it implies a position of authority and responsibility granted to the saints. This idea aligns with the broader biblical theme of believers sharing in Christ's reign (<a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4-6</a>). The notion of judging angels may refer to fallen angels, as suggested by <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>, where it speaks of angels who did not keep their positions of authority. The rhetorical question "Do you not know" indicates that this was a teaching Paul expected the Corinthians to understand, possibly from previous instruction or common early Christian teaching. This reflects the high status and dignity bestowed upon believers, contrasting with their current disputes and failures to resolve issues among themselves.<p><b>How much more the things of this life!</b><br>Paul uses a logical argument from the greater to the lesser. If believers are to judge angels, which is a significant and weighty responsibility, then they should certainly be capable of handling mundane, earthly matters. This phrase emphasizes the importance of wisdom and discernment in the Christian community. It challenges the Corinthians to rise above their petty disputes and to exercise the judgment and wisdom that will be required of them in the future. This also reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized resolving conflicts within the community (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). The phrase underscores the expectation that believers should live out their heavenly calling in practical ways, demonstrating the kingdom values in their daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and doctrinal challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, often serving as messengers or agents of His will.

Some suggest that it must signify bad angels; but this would be an unusual use of the word without any qualifying adjective. It is better, perhaps, to regard the passage as a climax arising out of the Apostle's intense realisation of the unity of Christ and His Church triumphant--a point which seems ever present to the mind of St. Paul when he speaks of the dignity of Christianity. In this sense, redeemed humanity will be superior to, and judges of, the spiritual world. That the words have some such large significance, and are not the expression of a hard and literal fact regarding some members of the angelic host, is, I think, borne out by the subsequent words, where the contrast to "angels" is not "men," but "things" relating to this life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we shall judge angels.</span> Angels, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some who belong, or once did belong, to that class. The statement furnishes no data for further speculation. It can hardly mean "evil spirits," for where the word is entirely unqualified it always means good angels; otherwise we might refer it to the "angels which kept not their first estate" (<a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). It is impossible, and not straightforward, to explain away the word "angels" as meaning Church officials, etc., or to make the word "judge" mean "involve a condemnation of them by comparison with ourselves." All that we can say is that "God chargeth even his angels with folly, and in his sight the very heavens are not clean" (<a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>); and that "to angels hath he not subjected the world to come" (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>). We must take the plain meaning of the apostle's words, whether we can throw any light on his conceptions or not. The only alternative is to suppose that the word means "those who <span class="accented">once</span> were good angels," but <span class="accented">are now</span> fallen spirits.
