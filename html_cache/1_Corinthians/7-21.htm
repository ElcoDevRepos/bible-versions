Slavery in this context was not based on race but on various factors such as war, debt, or birth. When Paul addresses those who were slaves at the time of their calling to Christianity, he acknowledges the reality of their social status. The calling refers to the moment of conversion to faith in Christ. This question highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel, which transcends social and economic barriers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that in Christ, there is neither slave nor free.<p><b>Do not let it concern you&#8212;</b><br>Paul advises believers not to be overly troubled by their earthly status, emphasizing that their spiritual identity in Christ is of greater importance. This reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where believers are encouraged not to worry about their lives but to seek first the kingdom of God. The focus is on the eternal perspective, where earthly conditions are temporary and secondary to one's relationship with God.<p><b>but if you can gain your freedom,</b><br>While Paul encourages contentment, he also acknowledges the value of freedom. The opportunity for a slave to gain freedom could arise through various means, such as manumission, purchasing one's freedom, or being granted freedom by a master. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking improvement in one's circumstances when possible, as seen in the story of Joseph, who rose from slavery to a position of power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-44</a>).<p><b>take the opportunity.</b><br>Paul advises taking the opportunity for freedom if it presents itself, suggesting that while one's spiritual status is paramount, improving one's earthly condition is also desirable. This aligns with the biblical theme of redemption and liberation, echoing the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate freedom found in Christ, who liberates believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). The encouragement to seize the opportunity for freedom reflects the balance between contentment in one's current state and the pursuit of better circumstances when possible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on various issues, including social status and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant economic and cultural influence.

Do not let that make you anxious.</span> The fact of your being in slavery does not affect the reality of completeness of your conversion; and so you need have no anxiety to try and escape from servitude. In this and the following three verses the subject of SLAVERY is treated of as the second illustration of the general principle laid down in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-17.htm" title="But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.">1Corinthians 7:17</a>--viz., that a man's conversion to Christianity should not lead him to change his national or social condition.<p><span class= "bld">But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</span>--These words may seem to imply that if a slave could obtain his liberty he was to avail himself of the opportunity to do so. Such an interpretation, however, is entirely at variance with the whole drift of the argument, which is, that he is <span class= "ital">not</span> to seek such a change. What the Apostle does say is, that (so far from letting the servitude be a cause of distress to you) if you can even be free, prefer to use it, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> your condition as a converted slave. It, as well as any other position in life, can be used to God's glory. Such an interpretation is most in accordance with the construction of the sentence in the original Greek; and it is in perfect harmony, not only with the rest of this passage, but with all St. Paul's teaching and his universal practice on this subject.<p>It may be well here briefly to notice the attitude which the Apostle of the Gentiles maintains towards the great question of SLAVERY. While there were many points in which ancient slavery under the Greek and Roman Governments was similar to what has existed in modern days, there were also some striking points of difference. The slaves at such a place as Corinth would have been under Roman law, but many of its harsher provisions would doubtless have been practically modified by the traditional leniency of Greek servitude and by general usage. Although a master could sell his slave, punish him, and even put him to death, if he did so unjustly he would himself be liable to certain penalties. The power which a master could exercise over his slave was not so evidently objectionable in an age when parents had almost similar power over their children. Amongst the class called slaves were to be found, not only the commonest class who performed menial offices, but also literary men, doctors, midwives, and artificers, who were constantly employed in work suited to their ability and acquirements. Still, the fact remains that the master could sell his slave as he could sell any other species of property; and such a state of things was calculated greatly to degrade both those who trafficked and those who were trafficked in, and was contrary to those Christian principles which taught the brotherhood of men, and exalted every living soul into the high dignity of having direct communion with its Father.<p>How, then, are we to account for St. Paul, with his vivid realisation of the brotherhood of men in Christ, and his righteous intolerance of intolerance, never having condemned this servile system, and having here insisted on the duty of a converted slave to remain in servitude; or for his having on one occasion sent back a Christian slave to his Christian master without asking for his freedom, although he counted him his master's "brother"? (See Ep. to Philemon.)<p>One point which would certainly have weighed with the Apostle in considering this question was his own belief in the near approach of the end of this dispensation. If all existing relations would be overthrown in a few years, even such a relation as was involved in slavery would not be of so great importance as if it had been regarded as a permanent institution.<p>But there were other grave considerations, of a more positive and imperative nature. If one single word from Christian teaching could have been quoted at Rome as tending to excite the slaves to revolt, it would have set the Roman Power in direct and active hostility to the new faith. Had St. Paul's teaching led (as it probably would, had he urged the cessation of servitude) to a rising of the slaves--that rising and the Christian Church, which would have been identified with it, would have been crushed together. Rome would not have tolerated a repetition of those servile wars which had, twice in the previous century, deluged Sicily with blood.<p>Nor would the danger of preaching the abolition of servitude have been confined to that arising from external violence on the part of the Roman Government; it would have been pregnant with danger to the purity of the Church itself. Many might have been led, from wrong motives, to join a communion which would have aided them in securing their social and political freedom.<p>In these considerations we may find, I think, ample reasons for the position of non-interference which the Apostle maintains in regard to slavery. If men then say that Christianity approved of slavery, we would point them to the fact that it is Christianity that has abolished it. Under a particular and exceptional condition of circumstances, which cannot again arise, St. Paul, for wise reasons, did not interfere with it. To have done so would have been worse than useless. But he taught fearlessly those imperishable principles which led in after ages to its extinction. The object of Christianity--and this St. Paul over and over again insisted on--was not to overturn and destroy existing political and social institutions, but to leaven them with new principles. He did not propose to abolish slavery, but to Christianise it; and when slavery is Christianised it must cease to exist. Christianised slavery is liberty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being a servant.</span> This is the second instance of the rule. One who was converted whilst he was a slave is not to strive over anxiously for freedom. The word "emancipation" sometimes seems (as in the letter to Philemon) to be "trembling on Paul's lips," but he never utters it, because to do so would have been to kindle social revolt, and lead to the total overthrow of Christianity at the very commencement of its career. Our Lord had taught the apostles to adapt means to ends; and the method of Christianity was to inculcate great principles, the acceptance of which involved, with all the certainty of a law, the ultimate regeneration of the world. Christianity came into the world as the dawn, not as the noon - a shining light, which brightened more and more unto the perfect day. <span class="cmt_word">Care not for it.</span> Do not be troubled by the fact, because in Christ "there is neither bond nor free" (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), and because earthly freedom is as nothing in comparison with the freedom which Christ gives (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</span> The words may mean, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "use freedom" - avail yourself of the opportunity of emancipation; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "use slavery" - be content to remain a slave. In favour of the first interpretation is the fact that there is nothing extravagant or fantastic in Christian morality; and that, considering what ancient slavery was - how terrible its miseries, how shameful and perilously full of temptations were its conditions - it sounds unnatural to advise a Christian slave to remain a slave when he might gain his freedom. Yet the other interpretation, <span class="accented">remain a slave by preference</span>, seems to be required: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By the strict interpretation of the Greek particles.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Were you a slave when you were called?</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#942;&#952;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekl&#275;th&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2564.htm">Strong's 2564: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I call, summon, invite, (b) I call, name.
