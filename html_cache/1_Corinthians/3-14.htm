The "building" represents the work and ministry of believers. The context is the judgment of believers' works, often associated with the "Bema Seat" judgment (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). The imagery of building is common in Scripture, with Jesus as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The idea of surviving implies a testing by fire, as mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, which purifies and reveals the true quality of the work. This testing can be seen as a metaphor for trials and challenges that reveal the authenticity of one's faith and efforts.<p><b>he will receive a reward</b><br>The concept of receiving a reward is tied to the faithfulness and quality of one's work for the Kingdom of God. In the cultural context of the Corinthian church, rewards were often associated with athletic competitions, where victors received crowns or prizes (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-25</a>). This reward is not about salvation, which is a gift of grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), but about the recognition of faithful service. The New Testament speaks of various crowns as rewards for believers, such as the crown of righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>) and the crown of life (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). These rewards are seen as eternal and incorruptible, contrasting with earthly rewards. Theologically, this underscores the importance of living a life that honors God and contributes to His Kingdom, with the assurance that such efforts are not in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
