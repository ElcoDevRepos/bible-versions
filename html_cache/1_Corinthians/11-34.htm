In the early church, the agape feast or love feast often accompanied the Lord's Supper, but some were treating it as an opportunity to indulge rather than a sacred observance. The instruction to eat at home emphasizes the need for reverence and self-control. This reflects the broader biblical principle of self-discipline and respect for holy practices, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13-16</a>, which calls for holiness in all conduct.<p><b>so that when you come together it will not result in judgment</b><br>The gathering of believers is meant to be a time of unity and worship, not division or judgment. The misuse of the Lord's Supper had led to divisions and even sickness and death among the Corinthians, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29-30</a>. This warning echoes the Old Testament principle that improper worship can lead to divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a> with Nadab and Abihu. The focus is on maintaining the sanctity of communal worship to avoid God's discipline.<p><b>And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters</b><br>Paul's promise to address other issues upon his arrival indicates that the Corinthian church had multiple areas needing correction. This reflects the apostolic authority Paul held and his role in establishing church order and doctrine. The phrase suggests that not all matters can be resolved through written correspondence, highlighting the importance of personal presence and leadership in church governance. This is consistent with Paul's approach in other letters, such as his plans to visit the Romans in <a href="/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23-29</a>, to provide further teaching and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse Christian community in the city of Corinth, dealing with various issues of conduct and doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_supper.htm">The Lord's Supper</a></b><br>A central event in the early Christian community, which Paul addresses in this chapter, focusing on its proper observance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>Refers to the consequences of improper behavior during communal gatherings, particularly the Lord's Supper.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/further_instructions.htm">Further Instructions</a></b><br>Indicates that Paul intends to provide additional guidance on this matter when he visits Corinth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/proper_preparation_for_worship.htm">Proper Preparation for Worship</a></b><br>Believers should prepare their hearts and minds before participating in communal worship to avoid judgment and ensure reverence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_equality_in_the_church.htm">Unity and Equality in the Church</a></b><br>The Lord's Supper should be a time of unity, not division.

Earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20&#8211;22</a>) he rebuked some for turning the Lord&#8217;s Supper into a private feast that left the poor embarrassed. Here he clarifies: physical appetite is not the purpose of the assembly. Consider how Jesus fed the five thousand (<a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15&#8211;21</a>), then shifted focus to the &#8220;bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26&#8211;27</a>). The meeting of believers is meant for spiritual nourishment first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He should eat at home</b><p>The directive is plain. A meal for satisfying hunger belongs in the home (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a> distinguishes daily meals from breaking bread in fellowship). By eating privately beforehand, worshippers avoid distraction and the temptation to treat communion like an ordinary buffet. This also echoes <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, where personal responsibility for one&#8217;s food is expected rather than imposing on the church gathering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that when you come together it will not result in judgment</b><p>Improper conduct at the Lord&#8217;s table had already brought discipline&#8212;some were &#8220;weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>). Paul warns that future assemblies must avoid repeating that error. Gathering with reverence prevents God&#8217;s corrective judgment, much like Israel was warned to approach the tabernacle in prescribed ways to avoid death (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;3</a>). The New Covenant community is no less accountable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when I come</b><p>Paul plans a personal visit (see <a href="/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18&#8211;19</a>). His apostolic presence will reinforce order, much as his previous visits shaped the churches in <a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1&#8211;11</a>. Knowing he will soon arrive encourages the Corinthians to begin correcting issues immediately.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will give instructions about the remaining matters</b><p>Not every detail is addressed in this letter; Paul will handle unresolved questions in person. This echoes his method in <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>, leaving Titus to &#8220;set in order what was unfinished.&#8221; Scripture offers enough to obey now, while allowing room for future guidance without compromising the present command to treat the Lord&#8217;s Supper with holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s closing line in this section is a practical safeguard: eat your regular meal at home so the church gathering focuses on Christ and avoids divine discipline. Until Paul can provide further direction, the Corinthians have clear marching orders&#8212;honor the Lord&#8217;s table with reverence, personal responsibility, and unity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">The rest</span>--or, literally, <span class= "ital">the remaining matters</span>--doubtless refers to some other details connected with the charity-feasts.<p>From the foregoing we gather the following outline of the method of celebration of the Lord's Supper in the Apostolic Church.<p>It was a common practice amongst the Greeks at this time to hold a feast called <span class= "ital">eranos,</span> to which all contributed, and of which all partook. A similar arrangement soon sprang up in the Christian communities, and were called <span class= "ital">agapae,</span> or "charity-feasts." At these gatherings was celebrated--probably at first daily, and afterwards weekly--the Lord's Supper. It consisted of two parts--a loaf broken and distributed during the meal, and a cup partaken of by all present after it. This bread and this cup were distinguished from the meal itself by the solemn declaration over them of the fact of the institution (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.">1Corinthians 11:26</a>). The entire feast, however, had a solemnity and sanctity imparted to it by the eucharistic acts which accompanied it; and while this bread and this wine constituted the "Supper of the Lord," the entire "charity-feast" became consecrated by it as a "Lord's Supper" (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a>), the phrase being similar to "Lord's day" (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>). To it the brethren came, not as individuals, but as members of the body of Christ. This gathering of the Church was His body now on earth; that sacramental bread and wine, the symbols of His body, which had been on earth, and which had been given for them. To the charity-feast the rich brought of their abundance, the poor of their poverty. But once assembled there everything was common. The party spirit which raged outside soon invaded these sacred scenes. The rich members ceased to discern in that gathering "the Body," and to discern themselves as "members of that Body." They regarded themselves as individuals, and the food which they brought as their own. The poor were put to shame; some of them arriving late would remain hungry, while the rich had eaten and drunk to excess. On those who acted thus there fell naturally God's judgments of sickness and of death. To correct this terrible evil and grave scandal, St. Paul recalls to them the solemnity of the act of Holy Communion, what it meant, how it was instituted. He reminds them of how the whole feast was consecrated by having that eucharistic bread and wine united with it, and he commands those who wanted merely to satisfy their natural hunger to do so at home before coming to the "Lord's Supper." The two thoughts of communion with Christ and communion with one another, and of the bread and wine being the medium of the union with Him, and the source of the Christian unity, intersect and interlace each other, like the fine threads of some tapestry which are so skilfully interwoven that you cannot distinguish <span class= "ital">them</span> while you look on the image or scene which they definitely produce. We may with theological subtlety dissever them; but if we do so we shall lose that loving image of the Holy Communion which the Apostle wrought out in his teaching, and on which he and the early Church gazed with tender adoration, and from which they drew the deepest draughts of spiritual life.<p><span class= "bld">When</span> <span class= "bld">I come.</span>--There is no definite indication of an approaching visit in these words. They are quite general "whenever I come"<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home.</span> A reminder of the <span class="accented">sacred</span> character of the <span class="accented">agape</span> as a symbol of Christian love and union.
