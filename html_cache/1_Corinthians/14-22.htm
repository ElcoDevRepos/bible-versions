In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses the Corinthian church's misuse of spiritual gifts, emphasizing that tongues are meant to be a sign. This aligns with the Old Testament prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11-12</a>, where foreign tongues were a sign of judgment to unbelieving Israel. The use of tongues as a sign underscores God's sovereignty and the authenticity of the gospel message.<p><b>not for believers, but for unbelievers</b><br>Tongues serve as a sign to unbelievers, particularly those outside the faith who witness the miraculous nature of the gift. In <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, the diverse crowd of unbelievers heard the apostles speaking in their own languages, leading to amazement and the conversion of many. This demonstrates that tongues can act as a tool for evangelism, drawing attention to the divine origin of the message. However, within the church, where believers already accept the gospel, tongues without interpretation can cause confusion rather than edification.<p><b>Prophecy, however, is for believers</b><br>Prophecy, in the New Testament context, refers to speaking forth God's truth, often involving revelation or insight given by the Holy Spirit. Unlike tongues, prophecy is intended to edify, encourage, and comfort the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>). It serves to build up the body of Christ, providing guidance and strengthening faith. Prophecy aligns with the role of the prophets in the Old Testament, who spoke God's word to His people, calling them to faithfulness and repentance.<p><b>not for unbelievers</b><br>While prophecy can convict and reveal the secrets of an unbeliever's heart (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</a>), its primary purpose is to benefit those who already believe. It fosters spiritual growth and understanding within the community of faith. The distinction between tongues and prophecy highlights the different roles these gifts play in God's plan for the church and the world. Prophecy's focus on believers underscores the importance of nurturing and sustaining the faith of the community, ensuring that the church remains grounded in truth and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding the use of spiritual gifts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which included a mix of religious practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A Christian community struggling with issues of spiritual gifts, unity, and order in worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelievers.htm">Unbelievers</a></b><br>Those who do not yet have faith in Christ, for whom the gift of tongues serves as a sign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Members of the Christian faith, for whom prophecy is intended to edify and instruct.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_gifts.htm">Understanding Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>Recognize that spiritual gifts have specific purposes and are given by God to build up the church and reach the lost.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_tongues.htm">Purpose of Tongues</a></b><br>Tongues are primarily a sign for unbelievers, demonstrating the power and presence of God in a way that can lead to conviction and conversion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_prophecy.htm">Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecy is intended for the edification, encouragement, and comfort of believers, helping to strengthen the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/order_in_worship.htm">Order in Worship</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of orderly worship that prioritizes understanding and edification, ensuring that all spiritual gifts are used appropriately.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_testing.htm">Discernment and Testing</a></b><br>Encourage believers to discern and test spiritual manifestations, ensuring they align with Scripture and edify the church.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_14_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 14:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_14_22_Tongues_purpose_for_unbelievers.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 14:22 define the purpose of tongues for unbelievers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Prophecies_role_for_believers_in_1_Cor_14_22.htm">What role do prophecies play for believers according to 1 Corinthians 14:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_tongues_properly_in_church.htm">How can we discern the appropriate use of tongues in our church today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Cor_14_22_Acts_2_4-11_on_tongues.htm">Connect 1 Corinthians 14:22 with Acts 2:4-11 regarding tongues and their purpose.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Prioritize_prophecy_or_tongues.htm">How should believers prioritize prophecy and tongues in their spiritual practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_tongues_as_sign_for_unbelievers.htm">What does 1 Corinthians 14:22 mean by "tongues are a sign for unbelievers"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_14_22_s_link_to_spiritual_gifts.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 14:22 relate to the purpose of spiritual gifts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_tongues_a_sign_for_unbelievers.htm">Why are tongues considered a sign for unbelievers in 1 Corinthians 14:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_corinthians_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Corinthians 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/when_will_the_gift_of_tongues_end.htm">When will the gift of tongues end?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_are_tongues_for_unbelievers,_yet_used_by_believers.htm">Why does Paul claim tongues are a sign for unbelievers (1 Corinthians 14:22), yet many modern churches practice them mostly among believers?

In that Old Testament setting, foreign languages were a sign of judgment&#8212;Assyrian invaders spoke words Israel could not understand.<p>&#8226; Carrying the same idea into the New Testament, the supernatural languages given at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4-12</a>) functioned as a clear, public marker that God was doing something extraordinary.<p>&#8226; Signs point beyond themselves. Here, the sign announces that the risen Christ has poured out the Spirit, fulfilling <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a>. The phenomenon is therefore real, purposeful, and God-initiated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not for believers</b><p>&#8226; Believers do not need a sign to prove that God is present; they already know Him (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>).<p>&#8226; In the gathered church, uninterpreted tongues add nothing to believers&#8217; understanding (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-6.htm">1 Corinthians 14:6, 9</a>).<p>&#8226; Because faith comes by hearing and understanding (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), a sign that bypasses comprehension is naturally directed elsewhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but for unbelievers</b><p>&#8226; Unbelievers are jolted when they encounter a miraculous language they recognize, as in <a href="/acts/2-7.htm">Acts 2:7-11</a>: &#8220;How is it that each of us hears them in our own native tongue?&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The sign confronts them with the reality of God&#8217;s power (<a href="/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17-18</a>) and their need to respond.<p>&#8226; Yet, if tongues dominate the service without interpretation, outsiders will simply conclude that &#8220;you are out of your minds&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>). The sign backfires when not handled orderly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prophecy, however, is for believers</b><p>&#8226; Prophecy&#8212;Spirit-prompted words spoken in the language of the hearers&#8212;edifies, exhorts, and comforts the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Because it is intelligible, prophecy strengthens faith, much like preached Scripture (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when unbelievers are present, clear prophetic words expose hearts and draw them to worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</a>), demonstrating its primary value inside the church family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not for unbelievers</b><p>&#8226; Prophecy does not function first as a miraculous sign but as direct instruction; without prior faith, its authority may be dismissed (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, when unbelievers overhear authentic prophetic speech, God can pierce their consciences&#8212;yet that is a by-product, not the main design.<p>&#8226; The gathered assembly must prioritize what builds up believers (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>), trusting God to use that very process to reach outsiders in His timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul contrasts two Spirit-given gifts by their primary audience and purpose. Tongues operate as an external sign to startle unbelievers with God&#8217;s reality, while prophecy serves as an internal channel to strengthen believers through clear, understood speech. When exercised in love and order, both gifts honor Christ and accomplish exactly what Scripture declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe.</span>--This is not an interpretation of the prophecy alluded to in the previous verse, but St. Paul now returns to the gift of "tongues" as existing in the Church, and introduces a thought regarding this gift suggested by the fact mentioned, viz., that in Israel unintelligible tongues, uttered in their hearing, were for a sign to unbelieving Jews. Tongues should not be exalted in estimation above prophecy--inasmuch as the function of the latter is really grander than that of the former. Tongues were useful to arrest the attention of unbelievers, and, if rightly used, to arouse their convictions; but prophecy is in the highest sense useful for believers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore.</span> In accordance with this illustration. <span class="cmt_word">Not to them that believe.</span> Because <span class="accented">their</span> belief depends on other and far deeper grounds.
