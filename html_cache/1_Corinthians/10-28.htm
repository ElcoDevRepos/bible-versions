The city was known for its temples and idol worship, and meat from sacrifices was often sold in markets. Paul emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to the beliefs of others, especially new converts or those weak in faith, who might struggle with the idea of consuming such food. This reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and not causing them to stumble in their faith (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13-15</a>).<p><b>then do not eat it,</b><br>Paul advises abstaining from eating the food if it is identified as having been offered to idols. This instruction is not about the food itself, as Paul acknowledges elsewhere that idols are nothing and food does not bring us closer to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4, 8</a>). Instead, the focus is on the impact of one's actions on others. This aligns with the teaching of Jesus, who prioritized love and consideration for others over strict adherence to ritualistic practices (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p><b>for the sake of the one who told you</b><br>The concern here is for the person who points out the food's origin. This could be a fellow believer or an unbeliever who is testing the Christian's commitment to their faith. By choosing not to eat, the believer demonstrates respect and sensitivity to the other person's conscience and beliefs. This act of self-denial serves as a witness to the love and freedom found in Christ, which is not used for self-indulgence but for serving others (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p><b>and for the sake of conscience&#8212;</b><br>Paul is concerned with the conscience of both the believer and the observer. The believer's conscience should be clear, acting in love and not causing others to stumble. The observer's conscience is also considered, as seeing a Christian partake in such food might lead them to confusion or sin. This reflects the broader biblical theme of living a life that is above reproach and mindful of the impact on others (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).

Here your personal liberty is to be modified by the principle mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-24.htm" title="Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.">1Corinthians 10:24</a>. If the weak brother see you eat the flesh which he has just informed you was used as a sacrifice, he may be led by your example to eat it himself, though the very fact of his having called your attention to it showed that he thinks it wrong, and so his conscience is defiled.<p>The word (<span class= "ital">hierothuton</span>) here used (according to the best MSS.) for "offered to an idol" is different from the condemnatory word (<span class= "ital">eidolothuton</span>) elsewhere used; as natural courtesy would lead a Christian at the table of a heathen to use an epithet which would not be offensive to his host. A lesson in controversy--Don't conceal your conscientious convictions, but don't express them in language unnecessarily painful to your opponent.<p>The repetition of the words "The earth is the Lord's," &c., in this verse is an interpolation not found in the best MSS., and tends to interrupt the thought which is carried on in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-29.htm" title="Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?">1Corinthians 10:29</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if any man say unto you.</span> Who is the "any man" is left undefined.

Perhaps there is a touch of delicate reserve in the word, implying that the remark is made at the table of heathens, who would be insulted by the word <span class="accented">eidolothuton</span>, sacrificed to <span class="accented">idols.</span> Whoever the interlocutor is supposed to be - heathen host or Christian guest - the mere fact of attention being drawn to the food as forming part of a heathen sacrifice is enough to make it your duty to give no overt sanction to idolatry. In that case, therefore, you ought to refuse it. It will be seen how gross was the calumny which asserted that St. Paul taught men to be <span class="accented">indifferent</span> about eating things offered to idols. He only taught indifference in cases where idolatry could not be directly involved in the question. He only repudiates the idle superstition that the food became <span class="accented">inherently tainted</span> by such a consecration when the eater was unaware of it. In later times, when the eating of such offerings was deliberately erected into a test of apostasy, he would have used language as strong against every semblance of compliance as any which was used by St. John himself or by Justin Martyr.
