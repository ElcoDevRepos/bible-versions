It highlights the order of creation and the interdependence between man and woman. Theologically, it underscores the idea of complementarity in the roles of men and women, as established by God. This creation narrative sets the foundation for understanding gender roles within the biblical context, emphasizing that woman was made as a suitable helper for man, reflecting unity and partnership.<p><b>so also man is born of woman</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the natural process of childbirth, where every man, including Adam, ultimately comes from a woman. It serves to balance the previous statement by showing mutual dependence. Historically, this reflects the cultural understanding of family and lineage in the ancient world, where genealogy was significant. It also points to the humility and equality before God, as all humans share the same origin through birth, regardless of gender.<p><b>But everything comes from God</b><br>This final phrase places the previous statements within the broader theological framework of God's sovereignty and creative power. It emphasizes that while there is an order and interdependence in creation, ultimately, God is the source of all life. This aligns with other scriptural affirmations of God's role as Creator, such as in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a> and <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>.

(<a href="/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The order of creation shows intentional design, not superiority. <a href="/1_timothy/2-13.htm">1 Timothy 2:13</a> reminds us, &#8220;For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By recalling Eve&#8217;s formation from Adam, Paul affirms the historicity of Genesis and upholds the complementary relationship God intended.<p>&#8226; This truth grounds practical instruction about honor and mutual respect within marriage and within the gathered church (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Man born of woman</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;so also man is born of woman.&#8221;

Woman&#8217;s origin from man shows God&#8217;s deliberate design; man&#8217;s birth through woman displays their ongoing interdependence; and both realities point upward to the Lord, who is the source of all. The verse calls believers to honor one another, celebrate God&#8217;s order without rivalry, and direct every breath of gratitude back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For as the woman is of the man.</span>--An appeal to the original act of creation proves the truth of the previous statement of the interdependence of the sexes. If already (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a>) the fact of woman's having been taken out of man was used as an argument to prove her subordination, there is now coupled with that fact of the origin of woman that other fact of the perpetual birth of man from woman, to show that there is a mutual relation. The first woman was made out of man; therefore woman is dependent on man. Every man has been born of a woman; therefore man is not independent of woman. In the Greek the word rendered "of" represents a finite act--the word rendered "by" a continued process.<p><span class= "bld">But all things of God.</span>--Thus, as usual, St. Paul completes the thought by tracing all up to God. The mediate processes of their origin may differ, but the source of their being is common--they, and all beings, and all things, and the sequence of all things come of God.
