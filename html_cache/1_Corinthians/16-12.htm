His ministry in Corinth is noted in <a href="/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27-28</a>, where he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah. Apollos is considered a significant figure in the early church, and his mention here highlights the unity and diversity of leadership within the early Christian community. The term "brother" emphasizes the familial bond among believers, transcending ethnic and cultural differences.<p><b>I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers:</b><br>Paul's urging indicates the importance of Apollos' potential visit to Corinth. The "brothers" likely refers to other Christian workers or leaders who were traveling with Apollos. This reflects the practice of sending groups of teachers or missionaries to support and strengthen churches, a common practice in the early church (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>). The collaboration among leaders like Paul and Apollos demonstrates the cooperative spirit in spreading the Gospel and nurturing the early Christian communities.<p><b>He was not at all inclined to go now:</b><br>Apollos' reluctance to visit Corinth at this time suggests a level of autonomy and discernment in his ministry decisions. This phrase indicates that even respected leaders like Apollos made decisions based on personal conviction and the leading of the Holy Spirit, rather than merely following directives. It also reflects the early church's respect for individual callings and the guidance of the Spirit in ministry work (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-7</a>).<p><b>but he will go when he has the opportunity:</b><br>This statement shows Apollos' willingness to visit Corinth when the timing is right, suggesting a commitment to the well-being of the Corinthian church. It underscores the principle of God's timing in ministry efforts, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. Apollos' eventual visit would be seen as part of God's providential plan for the church in Corinth, aligning with the broader narrative of God's sovereignty in the growth and development of the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apollos.htm">Apollos</a></b><br>A Jewish Christian from Alexandria, known for his eloquence and knowledge of the Scriptures.

(<a href="/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul speaks of Apollos as &#8220;our brother,&#8221; underscoring genuine family fellowship in Christ (cf. <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The reference reminds the Corinthians that teachers belong to the same household of faith and are not rivals (see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; 3:4&#8211;9).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;now about&#8221; signals Paul&#8217;s response to another issue the church had raised, just as he did with food offered to idols (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>) and spiritual gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers</b><p>&#8220;I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s urging shows pastoral initiative&#8212;he wants Apollos to revisit Corinth to strengthen them (compare <a href="/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27&#8211;28</a>, where Apollos first ministered in Achaia).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The brothers&#8221; likely refers to the delegation carrying this letter (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17</a>); Paul promotes team ministry, echoing <a href="/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>.<p>&#8226; The intensity of &#8220;strongly urged&#8221; communicates Paul&#8217;s deep concern that the Corinthians receive balanced teaching, countering any party spirit that had formed around Apollos&#8217; earlier ministry (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was not at all inclined to go now</b><p>&#8220;He was not at all inclined to go now.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Apollos, a faithful servant (<a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>), exercises responsible judgment; he discerns that an immediate visit could feed factionalism (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 1:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; His refusal shows that even apostles and co-laborers do not dictate one another&#8217;s schedules; leaders operate under the Lord&#8217;s timing (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;not at all inclined&#8221; teaches believers to wait when conscience or circumstances caution against action, mirroring <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6&#8211;7</a> where Paul himself waited.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he will go when he has the opportunity</b><p>&#8220;But he will go when he has the opportunity.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Apollos remains willing; the door of ministry must first open (<a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; This patience models submission to God&#8217;s providence, much like Paul&#8217;s earlier plan to visit Rome &#8220;in God&#8217;s will&#8221; (<a href="/romans/15-30.htm">Romans 15:30&#8211;32</a>).<p>&#8226; The assurance of a future visit reminds the Corinthians that God&#8217;s work continues even when schedules shift (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul reports that he urged Apollos to revisit Corinth, yet Apollos discerned that the timing was wrong and opted to wait for God-given opportunity. The verse illustrates Christ-centered unity among leaders, respect for individual guidance, and confidence in God&#8217;s sovereign timing&#8212;all lessons that still steer the church today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">As touching our brother Apollos.</span>--St. Paul, free from the smallest spark of personal jealousy, had wished that Apollos, whose name had been used as the designation of a faction in opposition to the Apostle himself, should go with this letter to Corinth. St. Paul had planted, Apollos had watered that Church, and in the absence of the planter, Apollos would have been the most likely and proper person to exercise authority there. The unselfish consideration of St. Paul is equalled by the thoughtful reluctance of Apollos, who fears that his presence might encourage the one faction, and perhaps embitter the other, and he declines, not considering it a "convenient" time to do so. In the thought of these teachers "convenient" meant the good of Christ's Church, and not the ease or comfort of any individual man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As touching our brother Apollos;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but as touching Apollos, the brother.</span> It seems clear from this that the Corinthians, in their letter, had requested that this eloquent and favourite teacher might be sent to them. <span class="cmt_word">I greatly desired him to come unto you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">besought him much.</span> There were at Corinth persons malignant enough to have suggested that Paul had refused their request; that he would not send Apollos to them out of jealousy of Apollos's superior oratory, and of the party which assumed his name. St. Paul anticipated this sneer. His nature was much too noble to feel the least jealousy. Both he and Apollos here show themselves in the purest light. <span class="cmt_word">His will;</span> literally, <span class="accented">there was not will.</span> The word "will" most frequently means "the will <span class="accented">of God,"</span> but if that had been the meaning here, the word would have had the article.

Here it means that Apollos had decided not to come at present, obviously because his name had been abused for purposes of party faction (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>). This was all the more noble on his part because he seems to have been a special friend of Titus (<a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>).
