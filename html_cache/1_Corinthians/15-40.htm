The "heavenly bodies" refer to celestial entities like stars, planets, and possibly angels, emphasizing their divine origin and eternal nature. The "earthly bodies" refer to human and animal forms, which are temporary and subject to decay. This distinction highlights the difference between the physical and the spiritual, a theme prevalent in Paul's writings (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a>). The concept of heavenly and earthly realms is rooted in Jewish cosmology, where the heavens are seen as God's domain, while the earth is the realm of humanity.<p><b>But the splendor of the heavenly bodies is of one degree,</b><br>The term "splendor" here can be understood as glory or radiance. Paul suggests that heavenly bodies possess a unique glory that is distinct from earthly bodies. This reflects the biblical theme of the heavens declaring the glory of God (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>). The "degree" implies a hierarchy or variation in glory, which can be seen in the differing brightness of stars and planets. This idea is further explored in <a href="/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>, where the righteous are compared to stars shining forever.<p><b>and the splendor of the earthly bodies is of another.</b><br>Earthly bodies have their own type of splendor, which is different from that of heavenly bodies. This acknowledges the beauty and complexity of creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God declares His creation "very good." The distinction in splendor underscores the diversity and order within God's creation. It also points to the transformation believers will undergo in the resurrection, as earthly bodies will be raised imperishable and glorified (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>). This transformation is a type of Christ, who was raised in a glorified body, serving as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth to clarify theological issues, including the resurrection of the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which often led to challenges in maintaining Christian doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The central theme of <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, where Paul discusses the nature of the resurrected body and the hope of eternal life for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_distinction.htm">Understanding the Distinction</a></b><br>Recognize the difference between earthly and heavenly bodies as part of God's creation.

Earthly splendor points forward to a greater, imperishable glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul uses the visible contrast between sky and soil to teach a deeper truth about resurrection. Heavenly bodies and earthly bodies each shine with God-given splendor, yet their glories differ. Just as stars exceed the brightness of earthly objects, so our future resurrected bodies will surpass the best this fallen world can offer, displaying the full radiance of God&#8217;s creative power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies</span> <span class= "bld">terrestrial.</span>--It is held by many that this is a distinct illustration from that which occurs in the next verse, and that the "celestial bodies" here spoken of are the bodies of angels, whose appearances on earth are accompanied (see <a href="/matthew/28-3.htm" title="His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="/acts/12-7.htm" title="And, behold, the angel of the Lord came on him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.">Acts 12:7</a>) by a blaze of glory or light. It is better, perhaps, to regard it as a general statement of what is expanded in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-41.htm" title="There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory.">1Corinthians 15:41</a>. The force of the three analogies introduced in this whole argument is that identity of matter is preserved amid variety of form, and on this point the difference between angelic bodies and human bodies would have no bearing. Between the earthly things and the heavenly things, such as the sun, moon, and stars, there is an identity of substance, but an infinite variety of form and of glory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial</span>. The words are often misunderstood. The "celestial bodies" are not the sun, moon, and stars of the next verse - for that would be a false antithesis to "bodies terrestrial" - but bodies (or organisms) which belong to heavenly beings, such as the resurrection body of our Lord and of glorified saints, or even in some sense of angels (<a href="/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/15-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[There are] also</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">heavenly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#940;&#957;&#953;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(epourania)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2032.htm">Strong's 2032: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and ouranos; above the sky.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bodies</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#333;mata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4983.htm">Strong's 4983: </a> </span><span class="str2">Body, flesh; the body of the Church.
