In the context of the early church, believers were encouraged to handle disputes internally rather than relying on secular courts. This reflects the principle of Christian unity and the belief that the church, guided by the Holy Spirit, is equipped to resolve conflicts among its members. The phrase "everyday matters" suggests issues that are not of significant spiritual or moral consequence but rather mundane or civil disputes.<p><b>do you appoint as judges</b><br>The appointment of judges within the church context implies a structured approach to conflict resolution. In the Jewish tradition, elders and leaders were often called upon to judge disputes, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</a>. The early church likely adopted a similar model, emphasizing wisdom and spiritual maturity over secular qualifications. This reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking godly wisdom, as highlighted in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.<p><b>those of no standing in the church?</b><br>This phrase challenges the practice of appointing individuals who lack spiritual authority or maturity to judge matters within the church. It underscores the importance of spiritual discernment and integrity in leadership roles. The term "no standing" suggests a lack of recognition or respect within the Christian community, which could undermine the authority and effectiveness of the judgment. This aligns with the biblical principle that leadership should be entrusted to those who are spiritually mature and respected, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in Corinth, Greece, dealing with internal disputes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Refers to those appointed to resolve disputes, highlighting the issue of appointing those without spiritual maturity or standing in the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment_in_leadership.htm">Spiritual Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>The importance of appointing spiritually mature individuals to handle disputes within the church.<br><br>Encourages the church to value spiritual wisdom over secular qualifications.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/internal_resolution_of_disputes.htm">Internal Resolution of Disputes</a></b><br>Emphasizes the biblical principle of resolving conflicts within the church community rather than seeking secular judgment.<br><br>Encourages believers to seek reconciliation and unity through Christ-centered mediation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_church_community.htm">The Role of the Church Community</a></b><br>Highlights the responsibility of the church to foster an environment where disputes can be resolved in a godly manner.<br><br>Encourages members to be active participants in maintaining peace and order within the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_witness_of_the_church.htm">The Witness of the Church</a></b><br>Stresses the impact of internal disputes on the church's witness to the outside world.<br><br>Calls believers to live in a way that reflects the unity and love of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_6_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 6:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_6_4_s_advice_on_believer_disputes.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 6:4 guide us in resolving disputes among believers?

He&#8217;s amazed that believers, destined to &#8220;judge the world&#8221; and even &#8220;angels&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2-3</a>), would drag such trivial concerns before secular courts.<p>&#8226; Everyday life often brings friction; Scripture never denies that (<a href="/luke/12-13.htm">Luke 12:13-14</a>). The issue is where believers look for resolution.<p>&#8226; Moses was taught to set up godly men to decide lesser cases so that the weightier matters could be handled by him (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>). Paul draws on that same logic: use spiritually minded people for everyday issues.<p>&#8226; The church in Jerusalem chose &#8220;seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom&#8221; to handle the distribution complaints in <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>. That model shows that normal, practical problems belong in the hands of spiritually mature believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you appoint as judges</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words come as a sharp question, calling out a practice that had already become routine in Corinth&#8212;handing Christian disagreements to pagan magistrates.<p>&#8226; The Old Testament pattern is clear: &#8220;You shall appoint judges and officials&#8230; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus laid groundwork for internal problem-solving: &#8220;If your brother sins against you&#8230; tell it to the church&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul has just reminded them that believers, not outsiders, are responsible to judge members when necessary (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>). So, when he says &#8220;do you appoint,&#8221; he is challenging them to replace worldly judges with those grounded in the Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those of no standing in the church?</b><p>Here is the sting. Corinthian believers were elevating non-believers&#8212;people &#8220;of no standing in the church&#8221;&#8212;over the family of God. Paul&#8217;s sarcasm exposes the absurdity.<p>&#8226; James rebukes assemblies that honor the rich outsider while shaming their own poor (<a href="/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>); Paul&#8217;s critique is similar.<p>&#8226; God often chooses the &#8220;lowly and despised&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</a>), yet the church was doing the reverse: honoring the ungodly in matters that should have remained spiritual family business.<p>&#8226; To place ultimate authority in hands not subject to Christ is to be &#8220;mismatched&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Paul urges them to recognize and respect spiritual credibility, not worldly credentials.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a> confronts believers who outsource minor disputes to secular courts. Paul reminds the church to keep everyday matters within the fellowship, appointing spiritually mature brothers and sisters&#8212;those with recognized standing in Christ&#8212;to act as judges. The verse calls Christians to honor the wisdom God supplies through His people, not to rely on a world that neither knows nor submits to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">If then ye have judgments. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If, however, you choose to have judgments to be given on matters of this life.</span> The last words show that the questions which are alluded to are purely worldly and not spiritual matters. The Apostle subsequently urges that such disputes ought not to arise at all amongst Christians, and that if they do they ought to be settled by the interposition of some mutual friend. Here he says, with something of sarcasm, "The very meanest of those who are to be exalted above angels, and to be judges of spiritual existences, is of sufficient authority to settle such matters as you are bringing before legal tribunals."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If then ye have,</span> etc. The verse implies that civil disputes might naturally occur among them. What he is here reprobating is their objectionable method of settling them. <span class="cmt_word">Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church.</span> This implies an utter scorn of trivial quarrels about personal rights. Surely the lowliest, the most unregarded members of the Church - those of no account - have wisdom enough to decide in such small matters. Thus when there arose a murmuring between Hebrews and Hellenists about the daily distribution to widows, the apostles, thinking that they had much more important work in hand than the adjustment of such jealousies, left the whole matter in the hands of the seven deacons. Some understand "those held of no account in the Church" to mean heathens; but he is here forbidding them to bring their quarrels before the heathens. Of course, ideally, none ought to be "despised" or "held of no account" in the Church; but St. Paul is here speaking relatively, and with reference to the views of the Corinthians themselves, and not without irony. The perfect participle, "those who have been set at nought," perhaps means persons of proved inferiority of judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
