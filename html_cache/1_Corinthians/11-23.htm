This aligns with <a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>, where Paul asserts that his gospel is not man-made but received through revelation. The transmission of divine truth is a key aspect of apostolic tradition, ensuring the purity and authenticity of the message. This also reflects the Jewish tradition of passing down teachings, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children.<p><b>The Lord Jesus,</b><br>The title "Lord" signifies Jesus' divine authority and sovereignty, a central tenet of Christian belief. This echoes <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Jesus as Lord. The use of "Jesus" highlights His humanity, reminding believers of His incarnation and earthly ministry. This duality of Jesus as both Lord and human is foundational to understanding His role as the mediator between God and humanity, as described in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>.<p><b>on the night He was betrayed,</b><br>This phrase situates the event within the context of the Last Supper, which took place during Passover. The betrayal by Judas Iscariot fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the psalmist. The timing of this event during Passover is significant, as it connects Jesus' sacrifice to the Passover lamb, a type of Christ, symbolizing deliverance and redemption, as seen in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>.<p><b>took bread,</b><br>Bread, a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizes sustenance and life. In the context of the Last Supper, it becomes a powerful symbol of Jesus' body, broken for humanity. This act prefigures the breaking of His body on the cross, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. The use of bread also connects to the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16), another type of Christ, as the true bread from heaven, as Jesus explains in <a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, who received the teachings about the Lord's Supper directly from Jesus Christ and passed them on to the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_jesus.htm">The Lord Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, whose actions during the Last Supper are being recounted by Paul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_night_he_was_betrayed.htm">The Night He Was Betrayed</a></b><br>Refers to the night before Jesus' crucifixion, highlighting the gravity and significance of the events that took place during the Last Supper.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, who were being instructed on the proper observance of the Lord's Supper.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The event where Jesus instituted the practice of communion, which is being referenced by Paul in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_apostolic_teaching.htm">The Authority of Apostolic Teaching</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes that his teachings are not of human origin but received directly from the Lord.

The method of communication (whether in a trance, or state of ecstasy, or any other supernatural manner) does not appear to cause either doubt or difficulty to those to whom the Apostle conveyed the information thus miraculously bestowed upon him.<p><span class= "bld">That which also I delivered unto you.</span>--The Apostle was not now for the first time communicating these solemn facts to the Corinthians. He had told them all this before, and therefore they were sinning against knowledge when they degraded a feast which they knew to be so solemn to a purpose so unworthy.<p>There now follows an account of the institution of the Lord's Supper, which, as compared with the accounts given in the Gospel narratives (see <a href="/context/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26-29</a>; <a href="/context/mark/14-22.htm" title="And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.">Mark 14:22-25</a>; <a href="/context/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19-20</a>), possesses some noteworthy features. The Evangelists (St. Matthew and St. Mark) wrote their accounts many years after the occurrence, and recorded what they remembered to have observed and heard. St. Paul writes here, within a very few years at all events of his having received it, an account of what had been directly communicated by the Lord. This was also most probably the first written record of what occurred on that solemn night.<p>The fact that St. Luke's narrative agrees most closely with St. Paul's, would imply, not as some rationalising critics insinuate, that St. Paul was indebted to St. Luke; but that St. Luke attached high value to an account which his companion had received directly from the glorified Christ. The only differences of any importance between St. Luke's and St. Paul's narrative are--(1) St. Luke writes "given for you;" St. Paul omits the word "given" (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1Corinthians 11:24</a>). (2) St. Luke omits the words "this do ye as oft as ye drink it," after the giving of the cup; but he implies them by stating that the cup was given "in like manner" to the bread, in connection with which he records these words. The suggestion that St. Luke copied his account of the Last Supper from this Epistle is a mere speculation, and in the highest degree improbable. If that Evangelist had used this Epistle in writing his Gospel, is it likely that he would have been content with giving the somewhat scanty account of our Lord's appearances after His resurrection, when he had at hand the much ampler record of the appearance to the 500 brethren and to James, which this Epistle contains? (1 Corinthians 15) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have received;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I received.</span> He thus refers the revelation to some special time, and this seems to point to the conclusion that he is not referring to any account of the institution of the Lord's Supper, which may have been given him by St. Peter or one of the twelve, but to some immediate revelation from Christ. The terms in which he describes the institution of the Eucharist resemble most nearly those of St. Luke, who may very probably have derived his information from St. Paul.
