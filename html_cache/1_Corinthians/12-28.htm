The original apostles were the twelve disciples, with Paul later added as an apostle to the Gentiles. Apostles were foundational to the early church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, where they are described as part of the church's foundation, with Christ as the cornerstone. Their role was to establish churches, provide doctrinal teaching, and ensure the spread of the Gospel message. The authority of apostles was unique to the early church era, and their writings form a significant portion of the New Testament.<p><b>second prophets</b><br>Prophets in the New Testament context were those who received direct revelation from God to edify, exhort, and comfort the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>). Unlike Old Testament prophets, who often foretold future events, New Testament prophets primarily focused on forthtelling&#8212;proclaiming God's truth to the church. Prophecy was a gift that required discernment, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20-21</a>, where believers are instructed to test prophecies. Prophets played a crucial role in guiding the early church, especially before the New Testament canon was completed.<p><b>third teachers</b><br>Teachers are those gifted in explaining and applying the Scriptures. Teaching is a vital function within the church, as it ensures that believers are grounded in sound doctrine. <a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a> highlights the responsibility and accountability of teachers, indicating the importance of this role. Teachers help believers grow in their faith and understanding, equipping them for service and protecting them from false teachings. The role of teaching continues to be essential in the church today, as seen in the pastoral epistles where Paul instructs Timothy and Titus on the importance of sound teaching.<p><b>then workers of miracles</b><br>Workers of miracles were individuals through whom God performed supernatural acts to confirm the message of the Gospel. Miracles served as signs to authenticate the apostles' message and demonstrate God's power (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). In the early church, miracles were a testament to the truth of the Gospel and the presence of the Holy Spirit. While the frequency and nature of miracles may differ today, God&#8217;s power to perform miracles remains unchanged.<p><b>and those with gifts of healing</b><br>The gift of healing involved the supernatural ability to restore health, serving as a sign of God's compassion and power. Healing was a prominent aspect of Jesus' ministry and continued in the early church (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a>). This gift demonstrated the in-breaking of God's kingdom and provided a foretaste of the complete healing believers will experience in eternity. While God still heals today, the gift of healing as seen in the early church was a specific sign gift for that era.<p><b>helping</b><br>The gift of helping, or service, involves assisting others in practical ways, often behind the scenes. This gift is crucial for the functioning of the church, as it supports various ministries and meets the needs of the congregation. <a href="/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a> and <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10-11</a> emphasize the importance of serving one another with the gifts God has given. Those with this gift often display humility and a willingness to serve without seeking recognition.<p><b>administration</b><br>The gift of administration involves organizing and managing church affairs effectively. This gift is essential for maintaining order and ensuring that the church's mission is carried out efficiently. In <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>, the appointment of deacons to oversee the distribution of food is an example of administrative gifting in action. Those with this gift are often skilled in planning, decision-making, and leadership, helping the church to function smoothly.<p><b>and various tongues</b><br>The gift of tongues involves speaking in languages unknown to the speaker, serving as a sign for unbelievers and a means of edification when interpreted (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22-27</a>). In <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, the apostles spoke in tongues at Pentecost, allowing people from various regions to hear the Gospel in their native languages. The use of tongues in the church requires order and interpretation to ensure it benefits the congregation. The gift of tongues is a subject of debate among Christians today, with differing views on its continuation and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles.htm">Apostles</a></b><br>These are the foundational leaders in the early church, chosen by Christ to spread the Gospel and establish churches.

Paul urges believers, &#8220;Do not treat prophecies with contempt&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20-21</a>), yet all prophetic words must align with Scripture (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>third teachers</b><p>&#8226;

Examples include Peter healing the lame man (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-9</a>) and Paul confronting Elymas (<a href="/acts/13-9.htm">Acts 13:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Such works remind the church that the Lord remains sovereign over creation (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those with gifts of healing</b><p>&#8226;

Every healing foreshadows the final wholeness promised in resurrection (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>helping</b><p>&#8226; The gift of helps meets practical needs so others can flourish (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226;
