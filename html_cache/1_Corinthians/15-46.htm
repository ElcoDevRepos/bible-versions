In the biblical narrative, God created the physical world first, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where the natural world and humanity were formed. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God often uses the physical to reveal spiritual truths. The natural precedes the spiritual in the order of human experience, highlighting the progression from the earthly to the heavenly. This order is also seen in the life of Jesus, who first came in the flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) before His resurrection and ascension into a glorified spiritual state.<p><b>but the natural</b><br>The term "natural" refers to the physical, earthly existence of humanity. In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, Paul is discussing the resurrection of the dead and the transformation from a perishable, natural body to an imperishable, spiritual body. The natural body is subject to decay and death, a consequence of the Fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This reflects the human condition under sin, where the physical world is marred by imperfection. The natural state is necessary for life on earth, but it is not the ultimate state for believers.<p><b>and then the spiritual</b><br>The "spiritual" refers to the transformed, glorified state that believers will experience in the resurrection. This transformation is a key aspect of Christian eschatology, where the perishable puts on the imperishable (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>). The spiritual body is not bound by the limitations of the natural body and is fit for eternal life in the presence of God. This progression from natural to spiritual is mirrored in the life of Christ, who was raised from the dead in a glorified body (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>). The spiritual state fulfills the promises of redemption and restoration found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where a new creation is promised.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing teachings on the resurrection of the dead and the order of creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>An ancient city in Greece where the church was established.
