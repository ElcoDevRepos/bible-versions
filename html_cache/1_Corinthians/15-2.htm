This message is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). The concept of salvation is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where God is often depicted as a deliverer (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). In the New Testament, salvation is understood as deliverance from sin and its consequences, achieved through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The assurance of salvation is a key theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing that it is not by works but by grace through faith.<p><b>if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you</b><br>The condition "if you hold firmly" suggests the necessity of perseverance in faith. This echoes Jesus' teaching in the Parable of the Sower, where only those who hold fast to the word bear fruit (<a href="/luke/8-15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>). The "word" refers to the apostolic teaching, which is consistent with the teachings of Jesus and the Scriptures. The early church faced various challenges, including false teachings, which required believers to remain steadfast (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>). The call to hold firmly underscores the importance of doctrinal purity and personal commitment to the truth of the gospel.<p><b>Otherwise, you have believed in vain</b><br>The phrase "believed in vain" warns against a superficial or temporary faith that does not result in genuine transformation or perseverance. This is reminiscent of <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The historical context of Corinth, a city known for its moral and spiritual challenges, highlights the need for a faith that is both genuine and enduring. Paul emphasizes that true belief must be accompanied by a life that reflects the gospel's transformative power (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The warning serves as a reminder that mere intellectual assent is insufficient for salvation; it must be accompanied by a living faith that endures to the end (<a href="/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing the importance of holding firmly to the gospel message he preached.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled congregation in the ancient city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>The good news of Jesus Christ's death, burial, and resurrection, which is central to Christian faith and salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The deliverance from sin and its consequences, granted by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/belief_and_faith.htm">Belief and Faith</a></b><br>The act of trusting in the gospel message, which is essential for salvation according to Paul's teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_perseverance_in_faith.htm">The Importance of Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>Salvation is not just a one-time event but a continuous journey of faith.

Salvation rests on the gospel Paul has just defined (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel is not advice but &#8220;the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It is entirely grace-based: &#8220;For it is by grace you have been saved through faith&#8230; not by works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Jesus died, was buried, and rose again &#8220;according to the Scriptures,&#8221; the believer&#8217;s rescue is already accomplished, not tentative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you</b><p>Here Paul highlights the necessary response to that finished work.<p>&#8226; Genuine faith continues; it is &#8220;established and firm, not moved from the hope of the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>). Perseverance is not an added requirement; it is the evidence that faith is real.<p>&#8226; Think of the seed in good soil: it &#8220;hears the word and understands it,&#8221; then produces a harvest (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>).

Empty belief never unites a person to Christ.<p>&#8226; Hebrews echoes Paul: &#8220;We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the confidence we had at first&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>). The point is not losing salvation but revealing whether it was ever possessed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a> packs comfort and challenge into one line. The gospel alone saves&#8212;because Jesus finished the work. Those truly rescued will cling to that message, proving its reality over time.
