In the biblical context, miracles served as signs to authenticate the message of the Gospel and the authority of the apostles. Examples include Jesus turning water into wine (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>) and the apostles healing the sick (<a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3:1-10</a>). These acts were not just displays of power but were meant to point people to the truth of God's kingdom. Historically, miracles were a common expectation in the early church, reflecting the belief in a God who intervenes directly in the world.<p><b>to another prophecy</b><br>Prophecy involves receiving and communicating a message from God. In the early church, prophecy was a vital gift for edification, encouragement, and consolation (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>). Prophets in the New Testament, like Agabus (<a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-28</a>), provided guidance and warnings to the church. This gift is rooted in the Old Testament tradition of prophets who spoke God's word to His people, often calling them back to faithfulness. Prophecy is not merely foretelling the future but also forthtelling God's truth.<p><b>to another distinguishing between spirits</b><br>Distinguishing between spirits is the ability to discern the true nature of spiritual influences, whether they are from God, human, or demonic. This gift is crucial for maintaining doctrinal purity and protecting the church from false teachings and prophets (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>). In the early church, this discernment was necessary to navigate the diverse spiritual experiences and teachings that arose. The ability to test spirits is emphasized in Scripture as a means to ensure alignment with the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>to another speaking in various tongues</b><br>Speaking in various tongues refers to the supernatural ability to speak in languages unknown to the speaker. This gift was first manifested at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4-11</a>), where the apostles spoke in different languages, allowing people from various regions to hear the Gospel in their native tongues. Tongues served as a sign for unbelievers and a means of personal edification (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22, 14</a>:4). The practice of speaking in tongues was a distinctive feature of early Christian worship, reflecting the universal reach of the Gospel.<p><b>and to still another the interpretation of tongues</b><br>The interpretation of tongues is the ability to understand and convey the meaning of messages spoken in tongues. This gift ensures that the church is edified by what is spoken in tongues, as it translates the message into a language the congregation can understand (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-5.htm">1 Corinthians 14:5, 14</a>:13). Interpretation is necessary for maintaining order and clarity in worship, aligning with Paul's instructions for orderly worship in the church.

There were such things as "deceitful spirits" which spoke "doctrines of devils" (l Timothy 4:1; <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 2</a>; see <a href="/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>). Divers kinds of tongues. There is no need for the word "divers." The particular variety of the ecstatic, and often entirely unintelligible, utterance known as "the tongue" differed with the individuality or temperament of the speaker. Recent lines of research, by that historical method which can alone furnish correct results, have led to the conclusion that, whatever may be thought of the "tongues" on the day of Pentecost (which is a separate question), the "tongue" spoken of (for the most part with <span class="accented">relative</span> disparagement) by St. Paul as a <span class="accented">charism</span> of the Spirit was closely analogous to that wild, rapt, unconscious, uncontrollable utterance which, with varying details, has always occurred in the religious movements which stir the human soul to its utmost depths. The attempts to explain the word "tongues" as meaning "foreign languages," or "the primeval language," or "poetic and unusual phraseology," etc., are baseless and exploded. The notion that by this gift the early Christians knew languages which they had never acquired, is not only opposed to the entire analogy of God's dealings, but to every allusion in the New Testament (except a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> but untenable view of the meaning of <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>) and to every tradition and statement of early Christian history. The apostles (so far as we have any record of their missionary work in the New Testament) had not the slightest need to acquire foreign languages. Since Palestine was at this epoch bilingual, they could all speak Aramaic and Greek, and therefore could address Jews and Gentiles throughout the civilized world. Every single allusion which St. Paul makes to this subject excludes the possibility of the supposition of a miracle so utterly useless and meaningless, so subversive of every psychological consideration, and so alien from the analogy of all God's methods, as the talking in unacquired foreign languages by persons who did not understand them. <span class="cmt_word">The interpretation of tongues.</span> Sometimes, but not always (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-13.htm">1 Corinthians 14:13</a>), the speaker, on relapsing from his ecstasy, was able to express his outburst of unintelligible soliloquy in the form of reasoned thought When he was unable to do so, St. Paul ordains that another should convey in ordinary language the impressions left by the inspired rhapsody (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-27.htm">1 Corinthians 14:27-29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to another</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_243.htm">Strong's 243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Other, another (of more than two), different.
