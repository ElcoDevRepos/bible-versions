The Passover feast commemorates Israel's deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing liberation from sin through Christ's sacrifice. The Apostle Paul encourages believers to live in a continual state of spiritual celebration, reflecting the new life they have in Christ. This aligns with the idea of the Church as a new covenant community, celebrating the fulfillment of the Passover in Jesus, the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>not with the old bread</b><br>The "old bread" symbolizes the former way of life before accepting Christ. In Jewish tradition, leaven (yeast) is often associated with sin and corruption because it permeates and changes the nature of the dough. Paul uses this metaphor to urge believers to abandon their old sinful habits and embrace a new life in Christ. This is consistent with the call to put off the old self and put on the new self, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>.<p><b>leavened with malice and wickedness</b><br>Here, "malice and wickedness" represent the sinful attitudes and behaviors that characterized the believers' lives before conversion. Malice refers to ill will or the desire to harm others, while wickedness encompasses broader immoral actions. Paul warns against allowing these elements to infiltrate the Christian community, as they can corrupt and destroy the unity and purity of the Church. This echoes the warning against the "leaven of the Pharisees," which is hypocrisy (<a href="/luke/12.htm">Luke 12:1</a>).<p><b>but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth</b><br>In contrast, "unleavened bread" symbolizes purity and holiness. Sincerity implies genuine, heartfelt devotion without pretense, while truth denotes alignment with God's word and reality. Paul calls believers to embody these virtues, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel. This aligns with Jesus' teaching that true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>). The imagery of unleavened bread also connects to the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which immediately follows Passover, emphasizing the call to holiness and separation from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on Christian living and church discipline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/church_in_corinth.htm">Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_feast.htm">Passover Feast</a></b><br>The Jewish festival that Paul metaphorically refers to, emphasizing purity and sincerity in the Christian life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaven.htm">Leaven</a></b><br>Symbolically used in Scripture to represent sin and corruption, which Paul warns against.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unleavened_bread.htm">Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Represents purity and truth, contrasting with the corrupting influence of leaven.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_leaven_and_unleavened_bread.htm">Understanding Leaven and Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Leaven represents sin and corruption.
