Initially skeptical of Jesus' ministry (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>), James' encounter with the risen Christ transformed him into a devoted leader of the Jerusalem church (<a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>). This appearance underscores the power of the resurrection to change hearts and lives. James' leadership role is further evidenced by his authorship of the Epistle of James, which emphasizes practical faith and righteous living. The appearance to James also fulfills the prophecy of familial restoration and leadership within the early church.<p><b>then to all the apostles</b><br>The term "apostles" refers to those specifically chosen and sent by Jesus to spread the Gospel. This appearance to all the apostles highlights the collective witness of the resurrection, which is foundational to Christian faith (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>). The apostles, including the original twelve and others like Paul, were entrusted with establishing the church and spreading the teachings of Christ. This collective appearance reinforces the unity and authority of the apostolic witness, as they were commissioned to teach all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).

The "James" intended is undoubtedly the only James then living, who was known to the whole Christian Church, namely, "the Lord's brother," the author of the Epistle, and the Bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>). James the son of Zebedee had by this time been martyred, and James the son of Alphaeus was never much more than a name to the Church in general. There is no mention of this appearance in the Gospel; but in the Gospel of the Hebrews was a curious legend (preserved in St. Jerome, 'De Virr. Illust.,' 2.) that James had made a vow that he would neither eat nor drink till he had seen Jesus risen from the dead, and that Jesus, appearing to him, said, "My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is risen from the dead." The truth of the appearance is strongly supported by the fact that James, like the rest of the Lord's "brothers," "did not believe" in Christ before the Crucifixion, whereas <span class="accented">after the Resurrection</span> we find him and the rest of "the Lord's brothers" ardently convinced (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3-5</a>; <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>, etc.).
