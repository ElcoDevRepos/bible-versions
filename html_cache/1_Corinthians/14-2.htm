In the early church, speaking in tongues was a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence and power. It is first prominently seen in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost, where the apostles spoke in various languages understood by people from different regions. This gift is often associated with the charismatic movement and is seen as a way to edify the individual believer.<p><b>does not speak to men, but to God.</b><br>The focus here is on the vertical relationship between the speaker and God, rather than a horizontal communication with other people. This suggests that speaking in tongues is primarily a form of prayer or praise directed towards God. It aligns with the idea that spiritual gifts are meant to glorify God and strengthen the believer's personal relationship with Him. This also implies that the gift of tongues is not primarily for public edification unless interpreted, as Paul later discusses in the same chapter.<p><b>Indeed, no one understands him;</b><br>This highlights the mysterious nature of speaking in tongues, as it is not understood by human listeners without interpretation. This lack of understanding can create confusion in a congregational setting, which is why Paul emphasizes the need for interpretation in public worship. The unintelligibility underscores the divine nature of the communication, as it transcends human language and understanding.<p><b>he utters mysteries in the Spirit.</b><br>The term "mysteries" suggests divine truths or revelations that are beyond human comprehension. In the biblical context, a mystery is something that was once hidden but is now revealed by God. Speaking in tongues, therefore, is seen as a way of expressing these divine mysteries through the Holy Spirit. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God revealing His will and purposes through the Spirit, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>, where Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ revealed by the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding spiritual gifts and orderly worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation facing issues of disorder and misunderstanding in worship practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/speaking_in_tongues.htm">Speaking in Tongues</a></b><br>A spiritual gift involving speaking in a language unknown to the speaker, intended for communication with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of the communication when one speaks in tongues, as the speaker utters mysteries in the Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who enables the believer to speak in tongues and communicate divine mysteries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_purpose_of_tongues.htm">Understanding the Purpose of Tongues</a></b><br>Speaking in tongues is primarily a form of communication with God, not for public edification unless interpreted.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit empowers believers to speak mysteries, emphasizing reliance on divine guidance in spiritual practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/order_in_worship.htm">Order in Worship</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s instruction underscores the importance of order and clarity in worship, ensuring that all spiritual gifts are used for the edification of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_edification.htm">Personal Edification</a></b><br>While tongues may not edify the congregation without interpretation, they can strengthen the individual believer&#8217;s spiritual life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_balance.htm">Discernment and Balance</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to seek a balance between personal spiritual experiences and the edification of the church community.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_14_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 14:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_14_2_s_view_on_tongues_today.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 14:2 guide our understanding of speaking in tongues today?

This is not the place to enter into the question of what particular external manifestation of this gift was evidenced on the Day of Pentecost. (See <a href="/context/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1-13</a>.) Still, believing that the gift of tongues here spoken of is identical with the gift of tongues which was first bestowed at Pentecost, I would say that the phenomena described as occurring then must be explained by the fuller and more elaborate account of the nature of the gift which is given to us here. Against the theory that the gift was one of a capacity to speak various languages we have three considerations. (1) The word <span class= "ital">dialectos,</span> which is repeatedly used to express languages (<a href="/acts/1-19.htm" title="And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; so as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.">Acts 1:19</a>; <a href="/acts/2-6.htm" title="Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.">Acts 2:6</a>; <a href="/acts/2-8.htm" title="And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?">Acts 2:8</a>; <a href="/acts/21-40.htm" title="And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,">Acts 21:40</a>; <a href="/acts/22-2.htm" title="(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he said,)">Acts 22:2</a>; <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>), is never used by St. Paul or by the author of the Acts in reference to the utterances of those who possessed the gift of tongues, but the other word, <span class= "ital">glossa,</span> which is, literally, the physical organ of speech--as if the utterances were simply sounds that proceeded from it. (2) There is no trace whatever of this knowledge of languages having been ever used for the purpose of preaching to those who spoke foreign languages. The language of the Lycaonians was evidently not understood by the Apostles when they were addressed in it (see <a href="/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>), and they did not speak in it. That the hearers at Pentecost said they heard those who were filled with the Spirit "speak in our own language" would only imply, either that the outpouring on Pentecost had for the moment a miraculous effect, which immediately ceased, or that "all the various elements of Aramaic and Hellenistic speech, latent in the usual language of the time, were quickened, under the power of this gift, into a new life, sometimes intelligible, sometimes unintelligible to those who heard it, but always expressive of the vitality and energy of the Spirit by which it was animated." (3) The description of the gift in this chapter is utterly inconsistent with it being a gift of languages. The gift was the result of a quickened spiritual power by the action of the Holy Ghost (see also <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44-46</a>; <a href="/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>); it poured itself forth in wild, impassioned utterances, which were sometimes mistaken for delirium (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23</a>); and these were the expressions, not of thoughts, but of feelings, unintelligible always, if uninterpreted, to the listener, and sometimes to the utterer himself. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In an unknown tongue.</span> The interpolation of the word "unknown" in our Authorized Version is quite unjustifiable, and shows the danger of giving way to the bias of mere conjectures. Probably it is this word, not found in the original, which has given rise to the perplexing, unhistoric, and unwarranted theory that "the gift of tongues" was a power of speaking in foreign languages. <span class="cmt_word">Speaketh not unto men</span>. Because, as a rule, no one understands anything that he says. The word literally means "hears." It may, perhaps, imply that no special attention was given to those who gave way to these impulses of utterance. The whole of this chapter proves in a most striking way the close analogy between "the tongue" and the impassioned soliloquies of inarticulate utterance which were poured forth in tones of thrilling power among the Montanists, and in modern times among the Irvingites. <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit.</span> It is uncertain whether this means "in his own spirit," or "in the Spirit of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of inspiration. Probably the former (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, etc.). Perhaps, however, the two imply the same thing. The spirit is the one Divine part of our human being, and when a man is a true Christian his spirit is in union with, is as it were lost in, the Spirit of God. St. Paul recognizes the true tongue - for it might be <span class="accented">simulated</span> by hysteria and even by mere physical imposture - as a result of inspiration, that is, of the overpowering dominance of the human spirit by a supernatural power. Nevertheless, he points out the extreme peril of yielding to or self inducing these emotions public, or in leaving them uncontrolled. <span class="cmt_word">Mysteries.</span> Secrets revealed possibly to him, but unrevealed by this strange "tongue" to others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
