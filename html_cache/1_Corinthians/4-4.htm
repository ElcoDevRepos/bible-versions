This reflects the importance of a clear conscience in Christian life, as seen in <a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>, where Paul strives to maintain a clear conscience before God and man. The conscience is an internal witness to one's actions and intentions, but it is not infallible. In the Greco-Roman world, conscience was often seen as a guide to moral behavior, but Paul acknowledges that it is not the ultimate judge.<p><b>but that does not vindicate me</b><br>Paul recognizes that a clear conscience does not equate to innocence or justification. This humility is consistent with biblical teachings that human judgment is limited and fallible. In <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, God reminds Samuel that humans look at outward appearances, but the Lord looks at the heart. Paul understands that self-assessment can be flawed, and true vindication comes from God alone. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God is the ultimate judge of human hearts and actions.<p><b>It is the Lord who judges me</b><br>Paul emphasizes that ultimate judgment belongs to the Lord, aligning with passages like <a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>, where believers are reminded that they are accountable to God, not to human judgment. This statement underscores the sovereignty of God in determining righteousness and justice. It also reflects the eschatological perspective that final judgment will occur at the return of Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, where all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ. This reliance on divine judgment encourages believers to live with integrity and accountability to God above all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

The Greek of the words rendered, "I know nothing of myself," is clearly "I am not conscious in myself" of having been unfaithful; the word being almost invariably used in classical Greek in a bad sense. In the English version the word "by" is used in a sense now nearly obsolete. To an English reader the passage at first sight seems to assert that St. Paul of his own power possessed no knowledge. In old English, however, the word "by" meant (not necessarily the instrument <span class= "ital">by</span> which) frequently "in connection with" or "concerning." In this sense it is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-16.htm" title="Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-7.htm" title="In you have they set light by father and mother: in the middle of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.">Ezekiel 22:7</a>. In Foxe's <span class= "ital">Book of Martyrs</span> a woman under examination is accused of having "spoken evil words <span class= "ital">by</span> the queen." It is still common to speak of our place being "by" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in close contiguity to) another, and a <span class= "ital">"bye-</span> lane" is a passage connected with a thoroughfare. The word "by" does not seem to have had necessarily the meaning of "against" which some have attributed to it; the sense of "concerning" would suit all the passages given above better than "against."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know nothing by myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">nothing against myself.</span> The phrase of the Authorized Version originally meant this, but is now obsolete in this sense. "I am sorry that each fault can be proved by the queen," says Cranmer to Henry VIII. It is like the Latin <span class="accented">Nil conscire sibi.</span> The same phrase occurs in the LXX. of <a href="/job/27-6.htm">Job 27:6</a>. St. Paul says, "The verdict of my own conscience acquits me of all intentional unfaithfulness;" but this is insufficient, because God sees with clearer eyes than ours. "Who can understand his errors?" asks the psalmist (<a href="/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>); and the "secret faults" against which he prays are not hidden vices, but sins of which he was himself unconscious. It must be remembered that St. Paul is here only speaking with conscious integrity of his ministerial work. Nothing could have been further from the mind of one who elsewhere calls himself" the chief of sinners" than to claim an absolute immunity from every form of self reproach. They who claim immaculate holiness can as little quote the sanction of St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a>, etc.) as of any other saint. The confessions of the holiest are ever the most humble. <span class="cmt_word">Yet am I not hereby justified.</span> Because "every way of a man" is apt to be "right in his own eyes," but God pondereth the hearts, and therefore in God's sight "no man living is justified." St. Paul is here using the word in its legal rather than its theological sense. <span class="cmt_word">He that judgeth me is the Lord.</span> This is a reason for serious awe and deep self searching of heart (<a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>; <a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>). Yet also for hope and confidence when a man can, like the modern statesman, "look from the storm without to the sunshine of an approving conscience within." For God, being "greater than our hearts" (<a href="/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>), may count "the long 'yes' of life" against the one "no," or the single faithless minute.
