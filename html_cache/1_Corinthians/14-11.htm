In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>, Paul addresses the use of spiritual gifts, particularly speaking in tongues. The emphasis is on edification and clarity. Without understanding, the gift of tongues becomes unfruitful for the congregation. This aligns with the broader biblical principle that God is not a God of confusion but of peace (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). The Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>) serves as a historical backdrop where language barriers were introduced, emphasizing the need for clear communication.<p><b>I am a foreigner to the speaker</b><br>The term "foreigner" here implies a lack of shared understanding and connection. In the ancient world, being a foreigner often meant being an outsider, lacking the rights and privileges of citizenship. This metaphor underscores the alienation that occurs when language is not understood. The church, as the body of Christ, is called to unity and mutual edification (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>). The use of spiritual gifts should foster inclusion and understanding, not division or exclusion.<p><b>and he is a foreigner to me</b><br>This reciprocal relationship highlights mutual incomprehension. In the early church, diverse backgrounds and languages were common, especially in cosmopolitan cities like Corinth. The church was a melting pot of Jews, Greeks, and other ethnicities. Paul&#8217;s teaching here encourages believers to seek gifts that build up the church, such as prophecy, which is understandable and edifying to all (<a href="/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1-5</a>). The ultimate goal is to reflect the unity and love of Christ, breaking down barriers (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth about the use of spiritual gifts, particularly the gift of tongues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation facing issues of disorder and misunderstanding in worship practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_gifts.htm">Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>Specifically, the gift of tongues and its proper use within the church for edification and understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its cultural diversity and as a hub of trade and communication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Used metaphorically by Paul to describe the disconnect and lack of edification when language is not understood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_understanding.htm">The Importance of Understanding</a></b><br>Spiritual gifts, including tongues, should be used in a way that promotes understanding and edification within the church.

If the meaning is hidden, that purpose is blocked.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern has always favored clear communication&#8212;think of Nehemiah&#8217;s priests who &#8220;read from the Book of the Law of God, translating and giving the meaning so that the people could understand the reading&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast this with <a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>, where God confused language to scatter the proud; lack of mutual understanding still scatters rather than gathers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am a foreigner to the speaker</b><p>When understanding is lost, fellowship is immediately hindered.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Two cannot walk together unless they are agreed&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>).
