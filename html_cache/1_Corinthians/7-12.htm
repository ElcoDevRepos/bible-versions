This does not imply that Paul's words lack authority; rather, it highlights that Jesus did not specifically address this situation during His earthly ministry. Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, provides guidance for circumstances not directly covered by Jesus' teachings. This reflects the early church's need to address new issues as the Gospel spread to diverse cultures.<p><b>If a brother has an unbelieving wife</b><br>The term "brother" refers to a Christian man, indicating that the early church included believers who were married to non-believers. This situation likely arose as individuals converted to Christianity while their spouses did not. The cultural context of Corinth, a cosmopolitan city with diverse religious practices, would have made such mixed marriages common. The challenge of maintaining a Christian household in a pagan environment is a central concern here.<p><b>and she is willing to live with him,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of mutual consent and willingness in the marriage relationship. The wife's willingness to remain with her Christian husband suggests a level of respect and harmony, even amidst differing beliefs. This reflects the broader biblical principle of peace and unity within the family, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>, which encourages believers to live peaceably with all.<p><b>he must not divorce her.</b><br>Paul advises against divorce in this situation, aligning with the broader biblical teaching on the sanctity and permanence of marriage (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>). This instruction underscores the potential for the believing spouse to positively influence the unbelieving partner, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3.htm">1 Peter 3:1-2</a>.

By writing &#8220;the rest,&#8221; he signals he has a specific audience in mind beyond the earlier categories. Similar narrowing of focus appears in verses like <a href="/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1&#8211;2</a>, where Paul distinguishes different relational groups within the church.<p>&#8226; This orderly approach shows pastoral care: each situation receives tailored guidance, just as Jesus addressed varied listeners in <a href="/bsb/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5&#8211;7</a>.<p>&#8226; It also reminds readers that God&#8217;s Word is sufficient for every life circumstance (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>(I, not the Lord)</b><p>Paul is not downgrading his words. He simply notes that Jesus, during His earthly ministry, did not directly teach on marriages where only one partner is a believer (compare <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3&#8211;9</a> and <a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11&#8211;12</a>, which spoke to marriages between two Jews). The apostle now provides Spirit-inspired instruction (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>, &#8220;I believe that I too have the Spirit of God&#8221;), adding authoritative guidance to complete the biblical witness.<p>&#8226; Just as Moses recorded fresh revelation beyond the patriarchs&#8217; experience (<a href="/bsb/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>), Paul extends Christ&#8217;s teaching to new scenarios arising in the Gentile mission.<p>&#8226; The statement underscores progressive revelation while affirming that &#8220;no prophecy of Scripture comes from the will of man&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If a brother has an unbelieving wife</b><p>The scenario assumes a Christian man already married when he believed, echoing <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31&#8211;34</a> where a household comes to faith at different moments. Scripture never commands a believer to marry an unbeliever (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>), yet it recognizes that conversions inside existing marriages create mixed unions.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a> describes a similar dynamic when a believing wife lives with an unbelieving husband, showing God&#8217;s concern for both genders in mixed marriages.<p>&#8226; This reality invites the believing spouse to be a living testimony at home (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is willing to live with him</b><p>The unbelieving wife&#8217;s willingness signals a peaceful coexistence. Paul later adds, &#8220;God has called you to peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>). The believer is not to force separation but to honor the spouse&#8217;s openness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a> urges believers, &#8220;If it is possible&#8230;live at peace with everyone,&#8221; and marriage is the closest arena for that command.<p>&#8226; Such patience mirrors Hosea&#8217;s faithful love toward Gomer, demonstrating covenant grace even amid spiritual disparity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must not divorce her</b><p>The directive is clear and binding: stay married. Marriage remains a covenant God hates to see broken (<a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>). Jesus affirmed, &#8220;What God has joined together, let man not separate&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>), and Paul applies that timeless principle here.<p>&#8226; The command protects the sanctity of marriage and the unbelieving spouse&#8217;s opportunity to experience salvation through daily witness (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm">1 Corinthians 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It also safeguards any children in the union, who are considered &#8220;holy&#8221; in the sense of covenant privilege (v. 14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s counsel in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm">1 Corinthians 7:12</a> extends Christ&#8217;s teaching to believers married to unbelievers: remain committed if the unbelieving partner desires to stay. This Spirit-guided command upholds the permanence of marriage, promotes household peace, and opens a path for the unbelieving spouse and children to encounter the gospel through the believing partner&#8217;s faithful love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">But to the rest.</span>--Up to this point the writer has alluded only to Christians; he has spoken of the duties of unmarried persons, of widows, and of those already married. There still remains one class of marriages concerning which differences of opinion existed--viz., mixed marriages. In a church like Corinth there would have been, no doubt, many cases where one of the partners was a heathen and the other a Christian, arising from the subsequent conversion of only one of the married couple. This subject is treated of in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12-16</a>. The words are emphatically, "If any man <span class= "ital">have already</span> a wife," &c. The case of a Christian marrying a heathen is not alluded to. In <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2Corinthians 6:14</a>, the marriage of a Christian to a heathen is forbidden.<p><span class= "bld">Speak I, not the Lord.</span>--The Apostle has no word of Christ's to quote on this point, it being one which did not arise during our Lord's life. (See Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>.)<p>It is to be noticed that the Apostle, in giving his own apostolic instruction on this point, does not use the word "command," which he applied to our Lord's teaching, but the less authoritative "speak."<p><span class= "bld">A wife that believeth not.</span>--That is, a heathen. In some modern religious circles this whole passage has been used (as also <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2Corinthians 6:14</a>) as if by "unbeliever" St. Paul meant a careless Christian, or one who, in modern phraseology, was not "converted." The Apostle is referring under this designation to heathens, and the only case to which his teaching could now or ever apply would be when two heathens had been married, and subsequently only one had embraced the Christian faith. It is <span class= "ital">to</span> be noticed that both here and in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.">1Corinthians 7:13</a> the being "pleased to dwell" is put only in reference to the partner who is a heathen, for the Apostle takes for granted that after the instructions he here gives to the Christian partner, no such desire for separation will arise on the part of a Christian. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Directions about mixed marriages.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the rest.</span> That is, to those who are married, but are heathen.
