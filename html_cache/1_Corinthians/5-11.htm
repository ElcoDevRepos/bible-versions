This letter serves as a corrective measure for issues within the church. The phrase indicates a shift from previous instructions, emphasizing the urgency and importance of the message. Paul&#8217;s letters often address specific problems, reflecting his pastoral concern and apostolic authority.<p><b>not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother</b><br>The term "brother" refers to someone who professes to be a Christian. Paul is concerned with the integrity of the church community. The instruction to not associate is a form of church discipline aimed at maintaining purity within the church. This echoes Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a> about dealing with sin among believers.<p><b>but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a drunkard or a swindler</b><br>Paul lists specific sins that were prevalent in Corinth, a city known for its moral laxity and diverse religious practices. Sexual immorality was rampant, and greed was common in a prosperous trade city. Idolatry was a significant issue due to the presence of many pagan temples. Verbal abuse, drunkenness, and swindling reflect behaviors that disrupt community harmony and contradict Christian values. These sins are also mentioned in other Pauline epistles, such as <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, highlighting their seriousness.<p><b>With such a man do not even eat</b><br>Eating together in the ancient world was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. By instructing believers not to eat with such individuals, Paul emphasizes the need for clear boundaries between the church and those who persist in sin. This aligns with the Jewish practice of social separation from those considered unclean or sinful, as seen in the Old Testament. The goal is both to protect the church's witness and to encourage repentance in the individual.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth struggling with moral and ethical issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/immoral_brother.htm">Immoral Brother</a></b><br>A professing Christian engaging in sinful behaviors listed by Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth and moral decadence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christian_community.htm">Christian Community</a></b><br>The broader body of believers who are called to live according to Christ's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_church_discipline.htm">Understanding Church Discipline</a></b><br>Church discipline is a biblical mandate aimed at restoring the sinner and protecting the church's purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_holiness.htm">The Importance of Holiness</a></b><br>Believers are called to live holy lives, reflecting Christ's character and avoiding behaviors that contradict their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_accountability.htm">The Role of Accountability</a></b><br>Accountability within the Christian community is crucial for spiritual growth and maintaining integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_sin_on_community.htm">The Impact of Sin on Community</a></b><br>Sin not only affects the individual but also the entire community, necessitating a collective response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_grace_and_truth.htm">Balancing Grace and Truth</a></b><br>While addressing sin, believers must balance grace and truth, aiming for restoration rather than condemnation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_5_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 5:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Spotting_1_Cor_5_11_behaviors_locally.htm">How can we identify behaviors listed in 1 Corinthians 5:11 within our community?

It may seem strange that the word "idolater" should be included in this category; for in what sense could a "brother" be a worshipper of idols? It is probable that the word "idolater" has involved in it the idea, not merely of worshipping an image, but of the sensuality which accompanied various forms of heathen worship, and of which evidently some of the Corinthian brethren were partakers. (See <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, and <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, where "idolatry" is identified with a vice kindred to lasciviousness.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now I have written unto you.</span> The tense used is, perhaps, the epistolary aorist, and is therefore equivalent to "but now I write to you;" otherwise the sense is, "but what I <span class="accented">meant</span> in my letter was," etc. The position of the words rather favours this view. St. Paul expressly tells them in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a> that he never intended to forbid all intercourse with heathens.
