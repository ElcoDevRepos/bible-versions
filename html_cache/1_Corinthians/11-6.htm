The practice of women covering their heads during worship was a reflection of the social norms of the time, where a covered head symbolized a woman's honor and her acknowledgment of authority. This practice is rooted in the broader biblical principle of headship, as outlined in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman. The head covering served as a visible sign of this order.<p><b>she should have her hair cut off</b><br>The suggestion that a woman should have her hair cut off if she does not cover her head is a rhetorical device used by Paul to emphasize the seriousness of the cultural practice. In the ancient world, a woman with a shaved head was often associated with shame or disgrace, sometimes linked to punishment or mourning. This statement underscores the importance of adhering to cultural norms that reflect one's commitment to God's order and the community's values.<p><b>And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off</b><br>Paul appeals to the Corinthians' sense of honor and shame, which were significant social constructs in the Greco-Roman world. A woman's hair was considered her glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>), and to have it cut or shaved was a sign of dishonor. This reflects the broader biblical theme of maintaining one's dignity and the importance of outward expressions of inward spiritual truths.<p><b>she should cover her head</b><br>The conclusion of the verse reinforces the expectation that women should cover their heads as a sign of respect and acknowledgment of divine order during worship. This practice is not merely about cultural conformity but is tied to the theological understanding of headship and authority. The head covering serves as a symbol of a woman's submission to God's established order, paralleling the submission of the church to Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24</a>). This act of covering is a type of Christ's submission to the Father, reflecting humility and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, including various religious practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The early Christian community in Corinth, dealing with issues of order and propriety in worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_in_the_church.htm">Women in the Church</a></b><br>The specific group addressed in this passage regarding head coverings during worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_practices.htm">Cultural Practices</a></b><br>The customs and societal norms of the time, particularly concerning gender roles and public appearance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_application.htm">Cultural Context and Application</a></b><br>Understanding the cultural context of Corinth is crucial.

that Jesus used (<a href="/luke/11-13.htm">Luke 11:13</a>), tying an agreed-upon shame to a spiritual one.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she should cover her head</b><p>- The command returns: keep the covering in place during prayer and prophecy (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>).<p>- It protects the testimony of the church, honors male headship (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>), and mirrors Christ&#8217;s own submission to the Father (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p>- Modern settings may differ culturally, yet the underlying principle&#8212;public, visible respect for God&#8217;s order&#8212;remains timeless, just as modesty does across eras (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- Application today focuses on clear, outward expressions that reinforce rather than blur God-designed distinctions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul links the outward sign of a head covering with the enduring truth of created roles. Refusing the sign is as egregious, he argues, as a woman mutilating her natural hair&#8212;an act that everyone would call shameful. Therefore, to honor God, respect His design, and guard the church&#8217;s witness, women in worship should maintain the appropriate symbol of submission, whatever culturally faithful form that takes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Let her also be shorn.</span>--The force of this argument depends on the fact that a woman's head being uncovered would be regarded by others as implying the same shame as was indicated by a woman's hair being cut short (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> shorn), or altogether removed (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> shaven). It is as if the Apostle said--If a woman insists on her right to pray and speak in an assembly with uncovered head, let her carry out this principle to its logical result; let her insist on her right to have her hair cut short, so as to show her equality with man--and what would be thought of her then! No woman with a spark of shame in her would think of doing that. Accordingly you admit that this principle of sexual equality does not apply in all such matters; and it is illogical to argue in favour of any general principle as if it were of universal obligation, when you yourselves admit that it is not applicable in some cases.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let her also be shorn.</span> Not a command, but, a sort of scornful inference, or <span class="accented">reductio ad absurdum<span class="cmt_word">.</span> If it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven.</span> When a woman was tried by "the ordeal of the water of jealousy," her head was uncovered by the priest (<a href="/numbers/5-18.htm">Numbers 5:18</a>).
