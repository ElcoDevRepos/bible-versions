His ministry in Corinth followed Paul's, and he was instrumental in watering the seeds Paul had planted. The question posed by Paul emphasizes the insignificance of human leaders compared to God's work. This reflects the early church's struggle with factionalism, as some believers aligned themselves with different leaders, creating divisions.<p><b>And what is Paul?</b><br>Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, was the founder of the Corinthian church. His rhetorical question here serves to downplay his own role, emphasizing that he, like Apollos, is merely a servant of God. This humility is consistent with Paul's teachings elsewhere, such as in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>, where he encourages believers to consider others better than themselves.<p><b>They are servants</b><br>The term "servants" (Greek: diakonoi) highlights the role of Paul and Apollos as ministers or deacons, emphasizing service rather than authority. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>, where greatness in God's kingdom is equated with servanthood. It underscores the idea that leaders in the church are to serve the body of Christ, not to seek personal glory.<p><b>through whom you believed</b><br>Paul acknowledges that both he and Apollos were instruments used by God to bring the Corinthians to faith. This reflects the biblical principle that faith comes through hearing the message of Christ (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). It also highlights the cooperative nature of ministry, where different individuals contribute to the spiritual growth of believers.<p><b>as the Lord has assigned to each his role</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty in assigning roles and tasks within the church. It reflects the teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>, where Paul explains that the Holy Spirit distributes gifts and roles according to His will. This understanding fosters unity, as it reminds believers that all roles are important and divinely appointed, reducing competition and division.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle of Jesus Christ, who played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in the first century.

But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-15</a> (replying to those who sneered at and despised his simple teaching as compared to the higher instruction of Apollos) he points out that though all are only instruments used by God, yet that if there be any difference of honour or utility in the various kinds of work for which God so uses His ministers, the greater work is the planting the seed, or the laying the foundation. There can be only one foundation--it is alike necessary and unvarying--many others may build upon it, with varied material and with different results.<p><span class= "bld">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">What then is Apollos? what is Paul?</span> and to these abrupt and startling questions the answer is, "Merely those whom Christ used, according as He gave to each his own peculiar powers as the means of your conversion."
