The concept of being "bound" indicates a legal and spiritual commitment, emphasizing the sanctity and permanence of marriage. In the cultural context of the first-century Greco-Roman world, marriage was a binding contract, and this teaching aligns with Jewish law, which also viewed marriage as a lifelong obligation. The phrase underscores the seriousness of the marital bond, reflecting Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, where He states that what God has joined together, no one should separate.<p><b>But if her husband dies,</b><br>This clause introduces the exception to the lifelong bond of marriage, acknowledging death as the only event that dissolves the marital covenant. In the historical context, widowhood was a significant social and economic challenge, often leaving women vulnerable. The Bible provides for the care of widows, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, which calls for believers to look after widows in their distress. Theologically, this reflects the temporary nature of earthly relationships compared to the eternal nature of the believer's relationship with Christ.<p><b>she is free to marry anyone she wishes,</b><br>This part of the verse affirms the widow's autonomy and freedom to remarry, a significant statement in a patriarchal society where women's choices were often limited. The freedom to choose a new spouse highlights the grace and liberty found in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, which speaks of the freedom believers have in Him. This freedom, however, is not without guidance, as the subsequent phrase provides a spiritual boundary for this choice.<p><b>as long as he belongs to the Lord.</b><br>This condition places a spiritual requirement on the widow's choice of a new husband, emphasizing the importance of shared faith in marriage. The phrase "belongs to the Lord" indicates a believer, aligning with the principle found in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, which advises against being unequally yoked with unbelievers. This requirement ensures that the marriage will be grounded in a mutual commitment to Christ, fostering spiritual unity and growth. Theologically, it reflects the idea that marriage is not only a personal relationship but also a partnership in serving God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Paul&#8217;s wording parallels &#8220;A married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives&#8221; (<a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>), underscoring the same principle.<p>&#8226; This binding reflects God&#8217;s original design in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>&#8212;one flesh, intended for permanence.<p>&#8226; The imagery of covenant faithfulness also appears in <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>, where marriage is described as a &#8220;covenant with your wife by covenant,&#8221; highlighting God&#8217;s seriousness about marital vows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But if her husband dies</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;But if her husband dies&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) introduces the single legitimate release from

the earthly covenant, not by human decision but by God&#8217;s sovereign boundary between life and death (<a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This reality offers comfort that God&#8217;s law takes compassionate account of life&#8217;s final transitions (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is free to marry anyone she

genuine liberty, not mere permission; Paul makes the same point when urging younger widows to remarry in <a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>.<p>&#8226; However, Paul also affirms singleness as honorable (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-8.htm">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>), so remarriage is a choice, not a command.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;anyone she wishes&#8221; honors personal agency, yet that freedom operates within godly boundaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As long as he belongs to the Lord</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;As long as he belongs to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) sets the essential boundary: the new spouse must be a believer.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s larger teaching on relationships reinforces this: &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Even apostles followed this pattern: &#8220;Do we not have the right to

(<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing a spouse &#8220;in the Lord&#8221; preserves the witness of Christian marriage and guards against divided devotion (<a
