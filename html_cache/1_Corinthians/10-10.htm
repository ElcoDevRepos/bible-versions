In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10</a>, Paul warns the Corinthian church by referencing the Israelites' behavior during their wilderness journey. Complaining is seen as a sign of discontent and rebellion against God's will. This admonition serves as a reminder to maintain a spirit of gratitude and trust in God's plan, echoing <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a>, which instructs believers to do everything without grumbling or arguing.<p><b>as some of them did</b><br>This phrase refers to the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt. The Israelites frequently complained against Moses and God, as recorded in the books of Exodus and Numbers. Their complaints often arose from fear, hunger, and a lack of faith in God's promises. This historical context serves as a cautionary tale for the Corinthian believers, illustrating the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith. The Israelites' behavior is documented in passages like <a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a> and <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>, where their grumbling led to severe consequences.<p><b>and were killed by the destroying angel</b><br>The "destroying angel" is a reference to divine judgment executed by an angelic being. In the Old Testament, such an angel is mentioned in several instances, including the Passover in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>) and the plague that struck Israel after David's census (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15-17</a>). In the context of the Israelites' wilderness journey, <a href="/numbers/16-41.htm">Numbers 16:41-49</a> describes a plague that killed many Israelites after they complained against Moses and Aaron. This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of rebellion against God and the reality of divine judgment.
