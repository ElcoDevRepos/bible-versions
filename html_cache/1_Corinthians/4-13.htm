Slander was a tool used by opponents to discredit the apostles and the message of the Gospel. This reflects Jesus' own experience, as He was often slandered by religious leaders (<a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>). The call to endure slander with grace is consistent with Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>).<p><b>we answer gently</b><br>The response to slander is not retaliation but gentleness, embodying the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). This approach mirrors Christ's own response to His accusers (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). The gentle answer is a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel, which calls believers to a higher standard of conduct (<a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>).<p><b>Up to this moment</b><br>Paul emphasizes the ongoing nature of the apostles' trials. This phrase indicates that the hardships faced by Paul and his companions were not isolated incidents but a continuous reality. It underscores the perseverance required in the Christian walk, as seen in Paul's other writings (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).<p><b>we have become the scum of the earth</b><br>The term "scum" refers to the residue or refuse that is discarded. In the Greco-Roman world, this imagery would resonate with the idea of something utterly worthless. Paul uses this strong language to highlight the apostles' lowly status in the eyes of the world, contrasting it with their high calling in Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>).<p><b>the refuse of the world</b><br>"Refuse" further emphasizes the apostles' perceived worthlessness by society. This reflects the cultural context where honor and status were highly valued. The apostles' willingness to be seen as refuse for the sake of the Gospel is a powerful testimony to their commitment and echoes Jesus' teaching that the last will be first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>). This phrase also connects to the prophetic imagery of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was despised and rejected by men.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

It flows from the Spirit&#8217;s fruit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and fulfills Jesus&#8217; charge, &#8220;Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-28.htm">Luke 6:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By answering slander with grace, Paul disarms hostility and highlights the gospel&#8217;s transforming power (<a href="/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14, 21</a>).<p>&#8226; This gentle reply also protects unity inside the church (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-3</a>) and keeps the focus on Christ rather than personal vindication (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-5</a>).<p>Takeaway: Believers do not get to choose how others speak to them, but they do choose how to respond. A soft answer &#8220;turns away wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>), making room for God to work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world</b><p>&#8220;Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>b)<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s vivid language underscores how society regarded the apostles&#8212;akin to garbage scraped off a dish. They endured hunger, homelessness, manual labor, ridicule (vv. 9-12).<p>&#8226; This shocking self-description contrasts with the Corinthians&#8217; quest for status (v. 8). Paul exposes the world&#8217;s upside-down value system: servants of Christ may look like failures while actually carrying eternal treasure (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows God&#8217;s servants treated as outcasts: &#8220;men of whom the world was not worthy&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36-38</a>), and Jesus Himself was &#8220;despised and rejected&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>; <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;up to this moment&#8221; reminds believers that present disgrace is temporary; future glory awaits (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: Expect misunderstanding and rejection. Faithfulness, not popularity, marks true discipleship (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul models how to face hostility: respond with Spirit-powered gentleness, refusing retaliation. He also redefines success&#8212;being counted &#8220;scum&#8221; by the world often means standing closest to Christ. Followers of Jesus can therefore meet slander with grace and endure contempt with hope, knowing God sees, rewards, and uses their humble witness to advance the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The filth of the</span> <span class= "bld">world.</span>--The word here used for "filth" occurs only in one other passage in the LXX. <a href="/proverbs/21-18.htm" title="The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.">Proverbs 21:18</a>, where it has the idea of an additional expiatory sacrifice. Perhaps the word is used here by the Apostle to include that idea in the sufferings, the description of which here reaches a climax. It is not only that we are the filth and off scouring of all men, but we are so for the sake of others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being defamed, we entreat.</span> The expression "we entreat" is very general. It may mean "we entreat men not to speak thus injuriously of us" (Calvin); or "we exhort them to do right." <span class="cmt_word">As the filth of the world</span>. The Greek word <span class="accented">katharmata</span> has a technical sense, in which it means "men devoted to death for purposes of expiation" (<span class="accented">homines piaculares</span>). The word <span class="accented">perikatharnmta</span> has the sense of "sin offerings" in <a href="/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>; Tobit 5:18. It is, however, doubtful whether this meaning of the word could have been at all familiar to Greek readers, and it is only in a very general and distantly metaphorical sense that the sufferings of God's saints can be regarded as, in any sense of the word, vicarious. It is better, therefore, here to retain the sense of "refuse" (<span class="accented">purgamenta</span>, things vile and worthless). <span class="cmt_word">The offscouring of all things;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">of</span> <span class="accented">all men.</span> The word <span class="accented">peripsema</span> means "a thing scraped off," and this word also was used in expiatory human sacrifices, where the formula used to victims thus flung into the sea, in times of plague or famine, was, "Become our <span class="accented">peripsema'</span> ('Schol. on Ar.;' Plut., 456). Thus in Tobit (5:18), Anna the wife of Tobias says, "Let the money be used as a <span class="accented">peripsema</span> for the child;" and Ignatius uses the phrase, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> From this and the similar phrase in the Letter of Barnabas," I am the <span class="accented">peripsema</span> of your love," it seems to have become a current expression of tenderness among Christians, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> But in this case also it may be doubted whether the sacrificial idea was present in the apostle's mind. He is thinking of scenes which he had already faced and would have to face hereafter, when mobs shouted against him that he was "a pestilent fellow" (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>) and not fit to live (<a href="/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">when we are slandered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#965;&#963;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dysph&#275;moumenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1426.htm">Strong's 1426: </a> </span><span class="str2">Evil report, defamation, words of ill omen.
