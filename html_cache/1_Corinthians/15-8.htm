Paul emphasizes that he was the last to witness the resurrected Jesus, underscoring the completion of the post-resurrection appearances. This is significant in establishing the credibility and authority of Paul's apostleship, as he was not among the original disciples. The phrase also highlights the unique nature of Paul's encounter with Christ, which occurred after the ascension.<p><b>He appeared to me also</b><br>Paul's encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>) is a pivotal moment in his life and ministry. This appearance is distinct from the others because it was a vision rather than a physical meeting. It underscores the transformative power of Christ's resurrection, as Paul, once a persecutor of Christians, becomes a devoted apostle. This appearance validates Paul's message and mission, aligning him with the other apostles who witnessed the resurrected Jesus.<p><b>as to one of untimely birth</b><br>The term "untimely birth" (Greek: ektroma) can be understood as an abnormal or premature birth. Paul uses this metaphor to express his sense of unworthiness and the abrupt, unexpected nature of his conversion. It reflects his humility and acknowledgment of God's grace in calling him to be an apostle. This imagery may also connect to the prophetic theme of God's unexpected choices, as seen in the calling of unlikely individuals throughout Scripture, such as David or Moses. Paul's use of this term highlights the miraculous and sovereign work of God in his life, transforming him from a persecutor to a proclaimer of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, who refers to himself as "one of untimely birth," indicating his unique and unexpected calling as an apostle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The risen Lord who appeared to Paul, marking a pivotal moment in Paul's life and ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_to_damascus.htm">The Road to Damascus</a></b><br>The event where Paul encountered the risen Christ, leading to his conversion and subsequent apostleship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of this letter resided, a significant center of early Christianity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection_appearances.htm">The Resurrection Appearances</a></b><br>The series of post-resurrection appearances of Jesus to His disciples and others, affirming His victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_grace_of_god_in_calling.htm">The Grace of God in Calling</a></b><br>Paul's reference to himself as "one of untimely birth" highlights the grace of God in calling him despite his past as a persecutor of the church.
