In the context of Corinth, a city known for its diverse culture and moral laxity, this saying might have been used to rationalize behaviors that were not in line with Christian teachings. The phrase suggests a sense of freedom, which is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, particularly in relation to the law and Christian liberty (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>). However, Paul emphasizes that Christian freedom is not a license for sin or selfishness.<p><b>but not everything is beneficial.</b><br>Paul introduces a principle of discernment, urging believers to consider the impact of their actions. The term "beneficial" implies a focus on what is truly good and constructive for oneself and others. This echoes the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which often contrasts wise and foolish behavior. The idea is that while Christians may have the freedom to do many things, they should prioritize actions that promote spiritual growth and the well-being of the community (<a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9-10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Everything is permissible,&#8221;</b><br>Reiterating the Corinthian slogan, Paul acknowledges the concept of Christian liberty. However, he challenges the believers to think beyond mere permission. This repetition serves to emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of freedom in Christ, which is not about indulging in every desire but about living a life that honors God and reflects His character (<a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>).<p><b>but not everything is edifying.</b><br>The term "edifying" refers to building up, particularly in a spiritual sense. Paul encourages the Corinthians to consider whether their actions contribute to the spiritual growth of themselves and others. This aligns with his teachings in other letters, such as <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>, where he advises believers to speak and act in ways that build up the body of Christ. The focus is on community and mutual edification, reflecting the interconnectedness of the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diverse culture and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth, commerce, and moral laxity, which presented unique challenges for the early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of morality, idolatry, and divisions within the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christian_liberty_and_responsibility.htm">Christian Liberty and Responsibility</a></b><br>While Christians have freedom in Christ, this freedom should be exercised with responsibility, considering the impact on oneself and others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_decision-making.htm">Discernment in Decision-Making</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern what is beneficial and edifying, not just what is permissible, in their daily choices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/edification_of_the_body.htm">Edification of the Body</a></b><br>Actions should be evaluated based on their ability to build up the church and contribute to the spiritual growth of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_stumbling_blocks.htm">Avoiding Stumbling Blocks</a></b><br>Consideration should be given to how one's actions might affect the faith and conscience of fellow believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_holiness.htm">Pursuing Holiness</a></b><br>The ultimate goal of Christian freedom is to pursue holiness and reflect Christ's character in all aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_10_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 10:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_10_23_Lawful_vs_Beneficial.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 10:23 guide our choices between lawful and beneficial actions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_not_all_is_constructive.htm">What does "not everything is constructive" mean for Christian living today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_all_lawful_to_ethics_today.htm">How can we apply "all things are lawful" to modern ethical dilemmas?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_10_23_s_link_to_community_love.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 10:23 relate to loving others in our community?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_endorse_seeking_benefits.htm">What other scriptures support the principle of seeking what is beneficial?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_10_23_Freedom_vs_Responsibility.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 10:23 define the balance between freedom and responsibility in Christian life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_does_not_all_is_beneficial_mean.htm">What does "not everything is beneficial" mean in the context of 1 Corinthians 10:23?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Christians_apply_all_is_lawful.htm">How should Christians apply "all things are lawful" in modern ethical dilemmas?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_corinthians_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Corinthians 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_church_sin.htm">Is everything permissible also beneficial?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_'all_lawful'_a_license_to_sin.htm">Does "all things lawful" permit us to sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_all_permissible_beneficial.htm">Is everything permissible also beneficial?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/can_christians_play_video_games.htm">Should Christians engage in playing video games?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Corinthians 10:23 Mean</div><b>&#8220;Everything is permissible,&#8221;</b><p>Paul echoes a slogan the Corinthians seemed to cherish.
