This appearance to Peter is significant as it highlights Peter's role as a leading apostle and his restoration after denying Jesus three times. The appearance to Peter is also mentioned in <a href="/luke/24-34.htm">Luke 24:34</a>, emphasizing the importance of Peter's witness to the resurrection. This encounter likely took place in Jerusalem, where the disciples were gathered after Jesus' crucifixion. Peter's leadership and transformation are further evidenced in the early chapters of Acts, where he boldly proclaims the resurrection.<p><b>and then to the Twelve</b><br>The term "the Twelve" refers to the group of Jesus' closest disciples, even though Judas Iscariot was no longer among them. This appearance underscores the foundational role of the apostles in the early church and their mission to spread the gospel. The meeting likely occurred in the upper room in Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-23</a>, where Jesus appeared to them despite locked doors, demonstrating His resurrected body's supernatural qualities. This appearance fulfilled Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16-22</a> that the disciples' sorrow would turn to joy. The Twelve, as witnesses of the resurrection, became the primary leaders in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14-42</a>, where Peter delivers the first sermon at Pentecost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cephas.htm">Cephas (Peter)</a></b><br>Cephas is the Aramaic name for Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples and a prominent leader in the early church.

If the claim were false, it could have been immediately challenged.<p>&#8226; Peter later preached this same resurrection message in <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32 and 10</a>:40-41, demonstrating how the private appearance moved him from fear to fearless witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And then</b><p>&#8226; Paul marks sequence: Jesus met Peter, &#8220;and then&#8221; others.

We have these appearances:--(1) To Cephas (see <a href="/luke/24-34.htm" title="Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.">Luke 24:34</a>). (2) To the Twelve--the phrase "the Twelve" being used to indicate, not the number of those present, but the group to which they belonged, as Decemviri might be used, or Hebdomadal Council, not to express the exact number but the corporate body--(see <a href="/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36</a>; <a href="/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>). This was probably the appearance to the ten Apostles, and is distinguished from a subsequent appearance to "all the Apostles." (3) To above five hundred brethren at once. This must have been in Galilee, for at a later date (see <a href="/acts/1-15.htm" title="And in those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)">Acts 1:15</a>) the Church at Jerusalem consisted of only one hundred and twenty disciples. (See <a href="/context/matthew/28-16.htm" title="Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.">Matthew 28:16-17</a>, and <a href="/acts/1-15.htm" title="And in those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)">Acts 1:15</a>.) (4) To James. This appearance is recorded only here and in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which is quoted by St. Jerome, "But the Lord, when he had given the <span class= "ital">sindon</span>" (the same word as that for the "linen garment," in <a href="/mark/14-51.htm" title="And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:">Mark 14:51</a>) "to the servant of the priest, had a table brought out, and bread on it, which He blessed and gave to James, saying, 'Eat thy bread now, brother, since the Son of Man has risen from the dead;' for James had sworn that he would not eat bread from the hour in which he had drunk the cup of the Lord until he should see Him rising from the dead." (5) To all the Apostles, Thomas being present (<a href="/john/20-26.htm" title="And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.">John 20:26</a>). (6) St. Paul himself (<a href="/acts/9-5.htm" title="And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 9:5</a>). To these facts St. Paul appeals. Most of those who saw Him were alive. Their enemies were alive to dispute it if they could. The witnesses had nothing to gain, everything to lose by telling the truth. The evidence was set forth some twenty-five or thirty years after the occurrence of the alleged facts. The Apostle here maintains the truth of an historical fact. He appeals solely to historical proof, and accumulates a mass of historical testimony, such as in any matter of history, if produced so shortly after the occurrence, would be deemed overwhelming. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was seen of Cephas</span> (<a href="/luke/24-34.htm">Luke 24:34</a>).
