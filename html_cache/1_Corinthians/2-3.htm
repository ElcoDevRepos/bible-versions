This reflects the broader biblical theme that God's strength is made perfect in human weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). In the Greco-Roman world, orators were expected to display confidence and eloquence, yet Paul intentionally contrasts this cultural expectation by emphasizing his own frailty. This approach underscores the message that the gospel's power does not depend on human ability but on the Spirit's work.<p><b>and fear</b><br>Paul's fear can be understood in the context of the challenges he faced in Corinth, a city known for its immorality and idolatry (<a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-17</a>). His fear may also reflect a reverent awe of the responsibility of preaching the gospel. This aligns with the biblical concept of the "fear of the Lord," which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Paul's fear is not a lack of faith but a recognition of the gravity of his mission and the spiritual opposition he encountered.<p><b>and with much trembling</b><br>The phrase "much trembling" indicates Paul's deep sense of responsibility and the emotional weight of his mission. This trembling can be seen as a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil and dependence on God. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God's servants often experience trembling in the presence of divine revelation or mission (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>). Paul's trembling serves as a reminder that the proclamation of the gospel is a serious and sacred task, requiring humility and reliance on God's power rather than human strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

Such fear is a sober recognition that eternal souls hang in the balance (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, &#8220;Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade men&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with much trembling</b><p>&#8220;Trembling&#8221; signals dependence on God.

The "weakness and fear and trembling" of which St. Paul speaks here had in it probably a large element of that self-distrust which so noble and sensitive a nature would feel in the fulfilment of such an exalted mission as the preaching of the Cross. I cannot think, however, the allusion is only to that. There is, I believe, a reference also to what we may call a physical apprehension of danger. The bravest are not those who do not experience any sensation of fear, but rather those who keenly appreciate danger, who have an instinctive shrinking from it, and yet eventually by their moral might conquer this dread. There are traces of this element in St. Paul's character to be found in several places, as, for example, in <a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>, when the Lord encourages him when labouring at Corinth with the hopeful words, "Be not afraid;" again in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>, when the terrible scene before Ananias had depressed him, the Lord is with him to strengthen him, "Be of good cheer, Paul;" and in <a href="/acts/27-24.htm" title="Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, see, God has given you all them that sail with you.">Acts 27:24</a>, when the angel of the Lord appears to him amid the storm and shipwreck, "Fear not, Paul."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was with you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I became</span> or <span class="accented">proved myself, towards you</span>, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In weakness</span>.

He shows an occasional self distrust rising from the consciousness of personal infirmities. This enhances our sense of his heroic courage and endurance. Doubtless this physical weakness and nervous depression were connected with his "stake in the flesh," which seems to have been an acute and distressing form of ophthalmia, accompanied with cerebral disturbance (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:215-221). <span class="cmt_word">In fear, and in much trembling.</span> Probably the words are even literally true, though they are a common phrase (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>).
