The term "so-called gods" reflects the Christian understanding that these entities, while acknowledged by society, do not possess true divinity. This aligns with the biblical assertion of monotheism, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>, where God declares, "I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God." The apostle Paul acknowledges the existence of these entities in the cultural consciousness but denies their divine status.<p><b>whether in heaven or on earth</b><br>This phrase indicates the widespread belief in both celestial and terrestrial deities. In ancient times, gods were often associated with natural elements and celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, as well as earthly phenomena like rivers and mountains. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern and Greco-Roman practice of attributing divine qualities to elements of the natural world, which is countered by the biblical narrative that God alone is the Creator of all things (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>).<p><b>(as there are many so-called gods and lords)</b><br>The repetition of "so-called" emphasizes the distinction between the true God and these entities. The term "lords" could refer to both divine and human figures of authority, such as emperors or local rulers who were often deified. This mirrors the biblical theme of false gods and idols, as seen in <a href="/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>, "For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens." The acknowledgment of "many" such figures highlights the pervasive nature of idolatry and the challenge it posed to early Christians living in a polytheistic society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and religious pluralism.
