The power of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in creation (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>), the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>), and the miracles of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a>). It underscores that the resurrection is not a natural event but a divine act.<p><b>God raised the Lord from the dead</b><br>This refers to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, a foundational event in Christian faith. The resurrection is documented in all four Gospels (Matthew 28, <a href="/mark/16.htm">Mark 16</a>, <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, <a href="/john/20.htm">John 20</a>) and is central to the apostolic preaching in Acts (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24, 3</a>:15). It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's victory over death. The resurrection is also a type of the future resurrection of believers, as Christ is the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><b>and He will raise us also</b><br>This promise of future resurrection for believers is a cornerstone of Christian hope. It is further elaborated in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, where Paul discusses the resurrection body and the victory over death. This assurance is rooted in the union with Christ, as believers are spiritually united with Him in His death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>). The future resurrection is also linked to the eschatological hope found in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, where the dead in Christ will rise at His return. This promise provides comfort and encouragement to live a life of faithfulness, knowing that death is not the end.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omnipotent Creator who possesses the power to raise the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose resurrection is a cornerstone of the faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled early Christian community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, and the future hope for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>God's power is not limited by death.
