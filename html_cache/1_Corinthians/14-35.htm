In the early Christian church, gatherings were often the primary source of teaching and theological discussion. The desire to inquire indicates an active engagement with the faith, which was encouraged within the bounds of order and propriety.<p><b>they are to ask their own husbands at home</b><br>This instruction reflects the cultural norms of the time, where the family unit was the primary context for learning and discussion. The home was considered a place of instruction, and husbands were expected to be knowledgeable in spiritual matters to guide their families. This directive also aligns with the broader biblical theme of order within the church and family, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>, where the relationship between husband and wife is likened to Christ and the Church.<p><b>for it is dishonorable for a woman to speak in the church</b><br>The term "dishonorable" reflects the cultural and social expectations of the time regarding gender roles. In the Greco-Roman world, public speaking was typically reserved for men, and women speaking in public settings could be seen as challenging social norms. This instruction is consistent with other passages in the New Testament, such as <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-12</a>, which emphasize orderly worship and the roles of men and women within the church.

Silence, however, is not ignorance. The phrase &#8220;If they wish to inquire about something&#8221; shows that women are encouraged to learn and to ask questions.<p>&#8226; This reflects Jesus&#8217; welcome of Mary, who &#8220;sat at the Lord&#8217;s feet listening to His message&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers are always urged to &#8220;search the Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>) and &#8220;get wisdom, get understanding&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet such inquiry must not disrupt congregational order, because &#8220;God is not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are to ask their own husbands at home</b><p>The Spirit directs the learning moment to the home, where the husband bears primary responsibility for spiritual leadership.<p>&#8226; Headship: &#8220;The husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Discipleship at home: &#8220;These words that I am commanding you today are to be upon your hearts.

Paul is not silencing every form of female participation (women pray and prophesy in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>); he is restricting the kind of speaking that examines, challenges, or judges prophetic words (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar guidance appears in &#8220;I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-12.htm">1 Timothy 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Titus is told that &#8220;older women&#8221; should teach what is good&#8212;within the spheres God assigns (<a href="/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The aim is consistent order: &#8220;Everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>By accepting this boundary, women honor God&#8217;s design and protect the unity of the gathered body.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/14-35.htm">1 Corinthians 14:35</a> establishes a practical guideline for orderly worship: women who have questions are warmly encouraged to learn, yet they should direct those questions to their husbands at home rather than interrogate speakers during the service.
