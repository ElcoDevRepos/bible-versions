In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>, Paul addresses the issue of eating food offered to idols. The "weak" are those who may still hold onto former beliefs or practices and are easily influenced or troubled by the actions of others. This highlights the importance of being considerate and loving towards those who may not have the same level of spiritual maturity.<p><b>for whom Christ died</b><br>This phrase underscores the immense value of every believer, regardless of their spiritual maturity. It serves as a reminder that Christ's sacrificial death was for all, emphasizing the unity and equality of all believers in the body of Christ. This echoes the teaching found in <a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>, where Paul also warns against causing distress to a brother for whom Christ died. It is a call to recognize the worth of each individual in the eyes of God.<p><b>is destroyed by your knowledge</b><br>The word "destroyed" here does not imply eternal damnation but rather a spiritual stumbling or harm. The "knowledge" refers to the understanding that idols are nothing and that eating food offered to them is not inherently sinful. However, exercising this knowledge without love and consideration can lead to the spiritual downfall of a weaker brother. This reflects the broader biblical principle found in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, where knowledge without love is meaningless. It is a call to prioritize love and edification over personal freedom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of believers in Corinth struggling with issues of conscience and liberty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/weak_brother.htm">Weak Brother</a></b><br>A believer whose conscience is sensitive and may be led into sin by the actions of others.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of Christianity, whose sacrificial death is the basis for salvation and unity among believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_every_believer.htm">The Value of Every Believer</a></b><br>Every believer, regardless of their spiritual maturity, is precious to Christ.

points to a vulnerability in faith, not a lack of worth; Jesus calls the weary and burdened to Himself (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently urges gentleness toward the weak: &#8220;We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak&#8221; (<a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>).<p>- The term brother reminds us that family ties in Christ outweigh personal freedoms (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for whom Christ died</b><p>- The value of this believer is measured by Calvary. &#8220;God proves His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;

That vulnerable brother, infinitely precious to Christ, can suffer real spiritual harm. Love, therefore, must govern liberty; knowledge surrendered to love protects the weak and honors the sacrifice of the Savior who died for them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And through thy knowledge shall . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and by means of thy knowledge the weak one perishes</span>--<span class= "ital">the brother for whom Christ died.</span> It is not, as in the English version, a question, but it is the expansion and interpretation of the previous statement. There is a great variety of readings in the MSS., but the weight of evidence is in favour of this reading. Christ <span class= "ital">died</span> for him. The sarcasm passes away in words of solemn and pathetic reproof. You won't give up your liberty for him. You will indulge yourself, and so prevent Christ's death being <span class= "ital">his</span> redemption.

It made him more emphatically one of "Christ's little ones," and Christ had pronounced a heavy malediction on all who caused such to offend. But if there is this "ruinous edification" upon the trembling and sandy foundation of a weak conscience, what could possibly follow but a gradual destruction? The <span class="accented">tense</span> is the present (the <span class="accented">praesens futurascens</span>), "and he who is weak, in thy knowledge, <span class="accented">is perishing"</span> - "the brother for whose sake Christ died." The order of the original often gives a force to the words, which it is difficult to reproduce, as here. The word "is perishing" becomes very emphatic by being placed first in the sentence. "Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died" (<a href="/romans/14-16.htm">Romans 14:16</a>). <span class="accented">Perish</span>; <span class="accented">terrificum verbum.
