Paul often encourages believers to think critically and apply wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-15.htm">1 Corinthians 10:15</a>). The call to "judge" reflects the broader biblical principle of discernment found in passages like <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>, where mature believers are expected to distinguish between good and evil.<p><b>Is it proper for a woman to pray to God:</b><br>The act of praying to God is central to Christian worship and personal devotion. In the early church, prayer was a communal and individual practice, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>. The question of propriety here relates to cultural norms and the orderliness of worship, which Paul addresses throughout 1 Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><b>with her head uncovered?</b><br>In the cultural context of Corinth, a woman's head covering was a sign of modesty and respectability. The practice of head covering is linked to social customs of the time, where a covered head signified a woman's marital status and her respect for her husband. This is further explained in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5-6</a>, where Paul discusses the implications of head coverings in worship. The head covering can also be seen as a symbol of authority and submission, reflecting the order of creation mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on various issues, including worship practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and dynamic early Christian community facing challenges related to cultural practices and spiritual gifts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_of_corinth.htm">Cultural Context of Corinth</a></b><br>A cosmopolitan city where Greek, Roman, and Jewish customs intersected, influencing the church's practices and beliefs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_sensitivity_in_worship.htm">Cultural Sensitivity in Worship</a></b><br>Understand the cultural context of biblical instructions.
