In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul is responding to questions from the Corinthian church about marriage and celibacy. The city of Corinth was known for its immorality and pagan practices, which included temple prostitution. This cultural backdrop made sexual temptation a significant issue for new believers. Paul acknowledges human weakness and the difficulty of maintaining celibacy for those who are not gifted with it, as he mentions earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>). This aligns with the biblical understanding that self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>), yet recognizes that not all possess it to the same degree.<p><b>let them marry</b><br>Marriage is presented as a legitimate and honorable solution for those who struggle with sexual self-control. This reflects the biblical view of marriage as a covenant relationship instituted by God (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). In the Jewish tradition, marriage was highly esteemed, and Paul upholds this view, suggesting that marriage is preferable to falling into sexual sin. The New Testament consistently affirms the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>), and Paul&#8217;s advice here is practical, providing a way to live righteously within the bounds of God&#8217;s design for human relationships.<p><b>For it is better to marry than to burn with passion</b><br>The phrase "burn with passion" indicates intense sexual desire that can lead to sin if not properly managed. Paul&#8217;s counsel is pragmatic, recognizing that marriage can serve as a safeguard against sexual immorality. This advice is consistent with the broader biblical teaching that sexual relations are to be enjoyed within the confines of marriage (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>). The imagery of "burning" suggests the consuming nature of unchecked desire, which can lead to destructive behavior. By advocating for marriage, Paul provides a constructive outlet for these desires, aligning with the biblical principle that God provides a way to escape temptation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on issues related to marriage and celibacy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its diverse population and moral challenges, including issues related to sexual immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a community of believers navigating their faith amidst a culture with differing values.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_self-control.htm">The Gift of Self-Control</a></b><br>Not everyone possesses the gift of celibacy.
