In the broader biblical context, grace is a central theme, underscoring that all spiritual gifts and ministries are given by God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Paul's recognition of grace aligns with his teachings in <a href="/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>, where he advises believers to think of themselves with sober judgment according to the measure of faith God has distributed.<p><b>I laid a foundation</b><br>Paul refers to his role in establishing the church at Corinth. The foundation he laid is the teaching of Jesus Christ and the gospel message (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>). This metaphor of laying a foundation is common in Scripture, symbolizing the initial and essential work of establishing faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The foundation is crucial, as it determines the stability and integrity of the entire structure, much like the cornerstone in ancient architecture.<p><b>as an expert builder</b><br>Paul likens himself to a skilled architect or master builder, indicating his careful and intentional work in planting churches and teaching sound doctrine. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where builders were highly regarded for their expertise. The term suggests not only skill but also wisdom and responsibility, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/24-3.htm">Proverbs 24:3-4</a>, where wisdom and understanding are necessary to build a house.<p><b>and someone else is building on it</b><br>This acknowledges the collaborative nature of ministry and the continuation of work by others, such as Apollos, who followed Paul in ministering to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). It reflects the early church's communal efforts and the importance of each person's contribution to the growth of the church. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>, where different roles are given to equip the saints for the work of ministry.<p><b>But each one must be careful how he builds</b><br>Paul warns of the responsibility that comes with building on the foundation of Christ. This cautionary note highlights the need for sound teaching and faithful ministry, as improper building can lead to spiritual ruin (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-15</a>). The imagery of building with care is reminiscent of Jesus' parable of the wise and foolish builders in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, emphasizing the importance of obedience to His words.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

Everything he is about to describe rests on God&#8217;s unearned favor.<p>&#8226; He echoes this in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>, &#8220;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was not in vain.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7&#8211;8</a> he testifies, &#8220;I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God&#8217;s grace&#8230; this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Grace does not excuse laziness; it empowers service. Paul&#8217;s ministry credentials are not human r&#233;sum&#233; lines but evidence of divine generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I laid a foundation as an expert builder</b><p>Having received grace, Paul acts with skill and intention.<p>&#8226; The foundation is Christ Himself, as he clarifies in the next verse: &#8220;For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul spent eighteen months in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>) teaching daily, ensuring that new believers were rooted in the gospel, not in philosophy or personality cults.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;expert builder&#8221; language underscores responsibility. Like the master craftsmen of <a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30&#8211;35</a> who were filled with the Spirit to build the tabernacle, Paul is Spirit-equipped to establish Christ&#8217;s church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and someone else is building on it</b><p>Ministry is a relay, not a solo sprint.<p>&#8226; Apollos followed Paul in Corinth; <a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24&#8211;27</a> shows him &#8220;mighty in the Scriptures,&#8221; watering what Paul had planted (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This hand-off pattern is healthy and expected. Paul tells Timothy, &#8220;What you have heard from me&#8230; entrust to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The text reminds us to rejoice when others advance the work we began, for the foundation is the same Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But each one must be careful how he builds</b><p>The warning is personal and sobering.<p>&#8226; Materials matter: &#8220;If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, his workmanship will be evident&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Motives matter: &#8220;Each one should test his own work&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Rewards or loss follow: &#8220;Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be fully rewarded&#8221; (<a href="/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical application:<p>&#8211; Teach sound doctrine, not novelty.<p>&#8211; Build people, not personal platforms.<p>&#8211; Serve in dependence on the Spirit, not fleshly effort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul, graced by God, laid Christ as the unshakable foundation. Others now construct the visible church upon that base, and every worker&#8212;pastor, teacher, volunteer&#8212;must build with care, knowing inspection day is coming. Grace initiates the work, skill and faithfulness shape it, and eternal reward or loss will reveal the quality of each builder&#8217;s contribution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">According to the grace of God.</span>--The Apostle being about to speak of himself as "a wise masterbuilder," takes care by commencing his statement with these words to show that he is not indulging in self-laudation, but merely pointing out what God had given him the grace to do. (See <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/12-3.htm" title="For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.">Romans 12:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Wise</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> skilful or judicious.<p><span class= "bld">Another buildeth thereon.</span>--The sequence of the work here is the same as in the planting and watering of the previous illustration. The use of the indefinite word "another" avoids what might be considered the invidiously frequent repetition of the name of Apollos, and also indicates that there were others also who came after Paul, as is evident from <a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a>. (See <a href="/romans/15-20.htm" title="Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:">Romans 15:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But let every man take heed how he</span> buildeth thereupon.--Better, <span class= "ital">But let each one see in what manner he buildeth thereon.</span> The argument in this and the following verse is that there can be only one foundation in the spiritual building--namely, the personal Jesus Christ. That foundation the Apostle has laid. None can alter it or add to it as a foundation; but there may be an immense variety in the materials with which those who come after the laying of the foundation may build up the superstructure. Therefore their own work and "how" they build (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with what materials), and not the one foundation once for all and unalterably laid, should be the subject of their thought and care. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the grace of God which is given unto me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which was given.</span> Here, again, we have St. Paul's <span class="accented">baptismal aorist</span> - his habit of regarding his whole spiritual life as potentially summed up in the one crisis of conversion and baptism.
