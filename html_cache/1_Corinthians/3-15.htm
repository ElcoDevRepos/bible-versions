In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>, Paul discusses the quality of each person's work in building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ. The imagery of fire is often used in Scripture to denote purification and judgment (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). The "burned up" aspect suggests that some works, though perhaps appearing valuable, lack eternal significance and will not withstand God's scrutiny.<p><b>he will suffer loss</b><br>The loss here is not of salvation but of reward. Paul emphasizes that while the believer's works may not endure, the individual will experience a loss of potential rewards in heaven. This aligns with the biblical principle of rewards for faithful service (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). The concept of suffering loss underscores the seriousness of living a life that aligns with God's purposes and the eternal consequences of our earthly actions.<p><b>He himself will be saved</b><br>This assurance of salvation highlights the security of the believer's eternal state, despite the loss of rewards. It reflects the doctrine of perseverance of the saints, where true believers are preserved by God's grace (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>, <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>). Salvation is based on faith in Christ, not on the merit of works, reinforcing the foundational Christian belief in justification by faith alone (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>but only as if through the flames</b><br>The imagery of escaping "through the flames" suggests a narrow escape, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. It evokes the idea of being saved from a burning building, where the person is safe but has lost everything else. This phrase serves as a warning to believers to build their lives with materials that will endure God's testing (gold, silver, precious stones) rather than those that will not (wood, hay, straw), as described earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-13</a>). It also reflects the refining process believers undergo, where trials and tests purify faith (<a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>, <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on spiritual maturity and the foundation of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges, where the early Christian church faced issues of division and immaturity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with divisions and needing instruction on building their faith on the foundation of Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The foundation upon which believers are to build their lives, as emphasized by Paul in the surrounding context of this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_judgment.htm">The Day of Judgment</a></b><br>An event implied in the passage, where the quality of each believer's work will be tested by fire.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_a_solid_foundation.htm">The Importance of a Solid Foundation</a></b><br>Jesus Christ is the only foundation for our faith.

The &#8220;it&#8221; is every believer&#8217;s work&#8212;everything we build on the foundation of Christ (v. 11).<p>&#8226; Fire in Scripture often symbolizes God&#8217;s searching, purifying judgment of believers&#8217; deeds, not their persons (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; When the &#8220;material&#8221; of our ministries, motives, and daily choices proves to be wood, hay, or straw, it is consumed. The test shows what had no eternal value.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will suffer loss</b><p>&#8226; Loss here is not of eternal life but of reward. Earlier verses contrast &#8220;reward&#8221; with &#8220;suffering loss&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-14.htm">1 Corinthians 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus warned, &#8220;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>). Failure to do so means missing the honor He longs to give (2 <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul likens it to an athlete who runs but does not receive the prize (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>). The regret is real, yet confined to reward, not relationship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He himself will be saved</b><p>&#8226; Salvation rests on the unshakable foundation laid in Christ alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>). Even when works burn, the believer stands secure because Christ&#8217;s finished work cannot burn.<p>&#8226; The judgment seat of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10-12</a>) evaluates service, not determines destiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But only as if through the flames</b><p>&#8226; Picture someone dashing out of a burning house with nothing but the clothes on his back&#8212;alive, yet empty-handed (<a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jude urges, &#8220;save others, snatching them out of the fire&#8221; (Jude 23), using the same imagery of narrow rescue.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores both the certainty of salvation and the seriousness of wasted opportunity. Eternal life is secure, but eternal reward is not automatic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a> teaches that every believer&#8217;s work will face Christ&#8217;s discerning fire. Whatever was done in dependence on Him endures; whatever was self-centered is consumed. The believer may lose reward and feel genuine loss, yet his salvation remains intact, secured by Christ alone. The verse calls us to build with gold, silver, and precious stones&#8212;acts and attitudes shaped by faith, love, and obedience&#8212;so that when the flames test our work, we will rejoice rather than regret.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">So as.</span>--These words remind us that the whole passage, and especially the reference to fire, is to be regarded as metaphorical, and not to be understood in a literal and physical sense. Forgetting this, Roman divines have evolved from these words the doctrine of purgatory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall suffer loss.</span> He shall not receive the full reward to which he might otherwise look (<a href="/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He himself shall be saved</span>. It is an inexpressible source of comfort to us, amid the weakness and ignorance of our lives, to know that if we have only erred through human frailty and feebleness, while yet we desired to be sincere and faithful, the work will be burnt, yet the workman will be saved. Some of the Fathers gave to this beautiful verse the shockingly perverted meaning that "the workman would be <span class="accented">preserved alive</span> for endless torments," "salted with fire" in order to endure interminable agonies. The meaning is impossible, for it reverses the sense of the word "saved;" and makes it equivalent to "damned;" but the interpretation is an awful proof of the distortions to which a merciless human rigorism and a hard, self styled orthodoxy have sometimes subjected the Word of God. <span class="cmt_word">Yet so as by fire;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through</span> or <span class="accented">by means of fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). We may be, as it were, "snatched as a brand from the burning" (<a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>; <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="/jude/1-23.htm">Jude 1:23</a>), and "scarcely" saved (<a href="/1_peter/4-18.htm">1 Peter 4:18</a>). Similarly it is said in <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a> that Noah was saved "through water" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>).
