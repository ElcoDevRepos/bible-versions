In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses a church in a city known for its philosophical and intellectual pursuits, contrasting human wisdom with divine revelation. The "things that come from the Spirit of God" include spiritual truths and divine wisdom, which are beyond human comprehension without the Spirit's illumination. This reflects the broader biblical theme that spiritual understanding is a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>, where Jesus speaks of being "born of the Spirit."<p><b>For they are foolishness to him,</b><br>To the natural man, spiritual truths appear as "foolishness." This echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>, where the message of the cross is described as foolishness to those who are perishing. In the Greco-Roman world, wisdom and rhetoric were highly valued, and the simplicity of the gospel message seemed absurd to those relying on human wisdom. This highlights the cultural clash between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world, a recurring theme in Paul's letters.<p><b>and he cannot understand them,</b><br>The inability to understand spiritual truths is not merely intellectual but spiritual. This aligns with <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>, which states that the mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God. The natural man's lack of understanding is due to a spiritual blindness, a condition that can only be remedied by the Holy Spirit's work in regeneration and illumination, as seen in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, where the Spirit is described as guiding believers into all truth.<p><b>because they are spiritually discerned.</b><br>Spiritual discernment requires the Holy Spirit's presence and activity in a person's life. This discernment is a gift, as described in <a href="/1_john/2-27.htm">1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2</a>:27</a>, where believers are said to have an anointing from the Holy One that teaches them about all things.

True psychology regards man as a trinity of natures. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>.) In accordance with this, St. Paul speaks of man as consisting of body (<span class= "ital">soma</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> soul (<span class= "ital">psyche</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> the <span class= "ital">soma</span> is our physical nature; the <span class= "ital">psyche</span> is our intellectual nature, embracing also our desires and human affections; the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> is our spiritual nature. Thus in each of us there is a somatical man, a psychical man, and a pneumatical man; and according as any one of those parts of the nature dominates over the other, so is the character of the individual person. One in whom the <span class= "ital">soma</span> is strongest is a "carnal," or "fleshly," man; one in whom the intellect or affections pre-dominate is a "natural," or "psychic," man; and one in whom the spirit rules (which it can do only when enlightened and guided by the Spirit of God, which acts on it) is a "spiritual" man. (See <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Natural.</span>--That is, literally, that part of our nature which we call "mind," and hence signifies that man in whom pure intellectual reason and the merely natural affections predominate. Now such a one cannot grasp spiritual truth any more than the physical nature, which is made to discern physical things, can grasp intellectual things. Spiritual truth appeals to the spirit of the man, and therefore is intelligible only to those who are "spiritual," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in whom the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> is not dormant, but quickened by the Holy <span class= "ital">Pneuma.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The natural man.</span> The Greek word is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (psychical); literally, <span class="accented">soulish, i.e.</span> the man who lives the mere life of his lower understanding, the unspiritual, sensuous, and egoistic man. He may be superior to the fleshly, sensual, or carnal man, who lives only the life of the body (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>); but is far below the spiritual man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). St. Paul (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>) recognizes the tripartite nature of man - body, soul, spirit. <span class="cmt_word">Receiveth not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "does not choose to accept." He judges them by the foregone conclusions of his own prejudice. <span class="cmt_word">Because they are spiritually judged.</span> The organ for the recognition of such truths - namely, the spirit - has become paralyzed or fallen into atrophy, from neglect; therefore the egoist and the sensualist have lost the faculty whereby alone spiritual truth is discernible. It becomes to them what painting is to the blind, or music to the deaf. This elementary truth is again and again insisted on in Scripture, and ignored by sceptics (<a href="/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6, 7</a>; <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44, 45</a>; <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>). This verse is sometimes used to depreciate knowledge, reason, and intellect. On that abuse of the passage, see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3. 8:4-11, an admirable passage, which Bishop Wordsworth quotes at length. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that if God has no need of human knowledge, he has still less need of human ignorance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The] natural</span><br /><span class="grk">&#936;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Psychikos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5591.htm">Strong's 5591: </a> </span><span class="str2">Animal, natural, sensuous.
