This reflects his pastoral care and responsibility towards the churches. The phrase "if it is advisable" suggests a consideration of the circumstances and the counsel of others, highlighting the importance of wisdom and discernment in decision-making. This aligns with the biblical principle of seeking counsel, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed."<p><b>they can travel with me</b><br>Paul is open to having others accompany him, which would provide accountability and transparency in handling the collection. This practice of traveling with companions was common in the ancient world for safety and credibility. It also reflects the communal nature of the early church, where believers worked together for the common good. The presence of companions would ensure the integrity of the mission, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20-21</a>, where Paul emphasizes the importance of doing what is

the collective judgment of the Corinthian church (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>).<p>&#8226; He will not impose himself; instead, he waits for confirmation that his presence would truly benefit the mission, echoing <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a> where the apostles and elders decided together before sending representatives.<p>&#8226; This attitude models <a

willingness underlines servant leadership: he is ready to shoulder the journey and potential hardship, reminiscent of <a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22&#8211;24</a> where he presses on despite looming trials.<p>&#8226; By mentioning himself last, Paul keeps the focus on the gift and the givers, not on his own prominence (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr

St. Paul would not take this money himself. His "religious" enemies were many, bitter, and unscrupulous, and he would give them no possibility of a handle against him. He makes such arrangements as should place him above suspicion (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20</a>). It turned out that the subscription was an adequate one, and St. Paul accompanied the Corinthian delegates (<a href="/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>).
