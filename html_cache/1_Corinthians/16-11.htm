In the cultural context of the early church, age and experience were often respected, and Timothy's youth might have led some to dismiss his authority or message. Paul emphasizes the importance of respecting Timothy, highlighting the biblical principle of honoring those who labor in the Lord's work (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). This aligns with the broader scriptural theme of God using the young and seemingly insignificant to accomplish His purposes, as seen with David (1 Samuel 16) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-7</a>).<p><b>Send him on his way in peace</b><br>Paul instructs the Corinthians to ensure Timothy's safe and peaceful departure. This reflects the early Christian practice of supporting and encouraging fellow believers, especially those in ministry. The phrase underscores the importance of unity and cooperation within the body of Christ, as seen in other passages like <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>. The peace mentioned here is not just the absence of conflict but the presence of God's blessing and favor, a common theme in Pauline letters.<p><b>so that he can return to me</b><br>Paul expresses his desire for Timothy to return to him, indicating the close relationship and partnership they shared in ministry. This reflects the early church's emphasis on mentorship and discipleship, where more experienced leaders like Paul would guide and support younger ones like Timothy. The return also suggests the itinerant nature of early Christian ministry, where leaders traveled extensively to establish and strengthen churches, as seen in <a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:1-5</a>.<p><b>for I am expecting him along with the brothers.</b><br>Paul anticipates Timothy's return with other believers, highlighting the communal aspect of early Christian missions. The "brothers" likely refers to fellow workers in the gospel, emphasizing the collaborative nature of Paul's ministry. This phrase connects to the broader New Testament theme of the church as a family, united in purpose and mission (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). It also reflects the practice of sending and receiving emissaries within the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22-33</a>, to maintain doctrinal unity and mutual support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, providing guidance and instruction to the early church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young disciple and companion of Paul, who was sent to Corinth to assist and encourage the church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant Christian community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brothers.htm">The Brothers</a></b><br>Fellow believers and co-workers in the ministry who were traveling with or expected to accompany Timothy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_fellow_believers.htm">Respect for Fellow Believers</a></b><br>The instruction to not treat Timothy with contempt highlights the importance of respecting all members of the body of Christ, regardless of age or status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/support_for_ministry_workers.htm">Support for Ministry Workers</a></b><br>Sending Timothy on his way in peace emphasizes the need to support and encourage those who are serving in ministry roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_church.htm">Unity in the Church</a></b><br>The expectation of Timothy's return with the brothers underscores the value of unity and cooperation among believers in fulfilling the mission of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_leadership.htm">Encouragement in Leadership</a></b><br>Timothy's example as a young leader serves as an encouragement for emerging leaders to step confidently into their roles, trusting in God's calling and the support of the church community.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_16_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 16:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_act_beyond_reproach_today.htm">How can we ensure others "have nothing to despise" in our conduct today?

Now that he knows how very bad is the condition of the Corinthian Church, and what need it has of vigorous treatment, he sends not only his Epistle, but with it Titus and two other brethren. (See <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2Corinthians 8:22-23</a>.) In energy and firmness of character Titus was a striking contrast to Timothy, while he equally shared the spirit and confidence of St. Paul. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> and 2 Corinthians 7, 8) He therefore was not only a bearer of this Epistle, but one fully competent and willing to deal energetically with the recalcitrant spirit of some sections of the Corinthian Church. The Apostle here expresses the hope that Timothy may join Titus and his party when they take their departure from Corinth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no man therefore despise him.</span> His youth and modesty seemed to invite a contempt which was only too consonant with the character of the Corinthians. <span class="cmt_word">I look for him with the brethren</span>. There was a reason for adding this. The Corinthians would see that any unkindness or contempt shown towards Timothy would at once be reported to St. Paul. Who "the brethren" are is not mentioned, for in <a href="/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> we are only told that Timothy was accompanied by Erastus. Perhaps St. Paul means with the brethren who conveyed this letter (see ver. 12), and who, as he supposed, would meet with Timothy at Corinth, or fall in with him on their return to meet St. Paul in Macedonia. One of these brethren must have been Titus (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7</a>), and there were two others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/16-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#942;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
