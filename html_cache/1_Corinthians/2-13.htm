This phrase underscores the importance of the apostolic teaching, which is foundational for the early church. The apostles' teachings are considered authoritative and divinely inspired, forming the basis of Christian doctrine. This aligns with <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.<p><b>not in words taught us by human wisdom</b><br>Paul contrasts divine wisdom with human wisdom, a recurring theme in 1 Corinthians. The Greco-Roman world valued rhetoric and philosophy, often seeking wisdom through human reasoning and eloquence. Paul rejects this approach, emphasizing that the gospel's power does not rest in human intellect or persuasive speech, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-25</a>, where he discusses the folly of human wisdom compared to God's wisdom.<p><b>but in words taught by the Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit is the source of true wisdom and revelation. This phrase highlights the role of the Spirit in guiding the apostles to convey God's truth. The Spirit's teaching is superior to human wisdom, as it reveals the mysteries of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>). This aligns with Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a> that the Holy Spirit would teach and remind the disciples of all He said.<p><b>expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words</b><br>Paul speaks of conveying spiritual realities using language inspired by the Holy Spirit. This involves interpreting and communicating divine truths that transcend human understanding. The phrase suggests a depth of insight that only the Spirit can provide, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where the natural person cannot accept spiritual things. This also connects to the idea of spiritual discernment, a gift of the Spirit mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on spiritual wisdom and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often divided early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its cultural and philosophical influences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who imparts wisdom and understanding to believers, enabling them to comprehend and communicate spiritual truths.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth, commerce, and philosophical schools, which often emphasized human wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_truths.htm">Spiritual Truths</a></b><br>The divine revelations and teachings that are understood and communicated through the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_true_wisdom.htm">The Source of True Wisdom</a></b><br>True wisdom and understanding come from the Holy Spirit, not from human intellect or philosophy.

The word translated here "comparing" in our Authorised version is used in the sense of expounding or teaching in the LXX. (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm" title="And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.">Genesis 40:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/40-16.htm" title="When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:">Genesis 40:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-12.htm" title="For as much as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.">Daniel 5:12</a>), especially of dreams, where the dream is, so to speak, "compared" with the interpretation. So here, the spiritual things are "compared" with the spiritual language in which they are stated. Another meaning--<span class= "ital">explaining spiritual things to spiritual men</span>--has been suggested, but that adopted would seem to be the more simple and natural. This second interpretation, would make these words the introduction to the remark which follows about "the spiritual man," but it involves a use of the word in which it is not found elsewhere in the New Testament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span> The meaning of this clause is very uncertain. It has been rendered, "Blending spiritual things with spiritual" (Kling, Wordsworth), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not adulterating them with carnal admixtures (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).

"Explaining spiritual things in spiritual words." This meaning the Greek will not bear, but Calvin and Beza get the same meaning by rendering it, "Adapting spiritual things to spiritual words." It is doubtful whether the Greek verb (<span class="accented">sunkrinontes</span>) can be rendered "comparing," which comes from the Vulgate, <span class="accented">comparantes.</span> Wickliffe has the version, "Maken a liknesse of spyritual things to goostli men, for a besteli man persuyved not through thingis." The commonest sense of the word in the LXX. is "interpreting" (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>, etc.), and the best rendering is, "Explaining spirituals to spiritual men." If it be supposed that the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> acquired the sense of "comparing" in Hellenistic Greek (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; Wisd. 7:29 Wisd. 15:18), then the rendering of our Authorized Version may stand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[this is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7939;</span> <span class="translit">(ha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[what] we speak,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(laloumen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
