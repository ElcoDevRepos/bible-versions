In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul emphasizes the sovereignty and authority of God, who is the source of all spiritual gifts and the one who initiates the call to salvation. This aligns with the Old Testament understanding of God as the covenant-keeping deity who is actively involved in the lives of His people.<p><b>who has called you</b><br>The concept of being "called" is significant in Pauline theology. It implies a divine initiative where God invites individuals into a relationship with Him. This calling is not based on human merit but on God's grace and purpose. It echoes the calling of the Israelites in the Old Testament, where God chose them to be His people. In the New Testament, this calling extends to all believers, signifying their election and purpose in God's plan.<p><b>into fellowship with His Son</b><br>"Fellowship" (Greek: koinonia) denotes a deep, intimate relationship. This fellowship is not merely social but spiritual, involving a shared life with Jesus Christ. It reflects the unity and communion believers have with Christ, akin to the vine and branches metaphor in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>. This fellowship is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers are united with Christ in His death and resurrection.<p><b>Jesus Christ our Lord</b><br>The full title "Jesus Christ our Lord" underscores the identity and authority of Jesus. "Jesus" refers to His human name, "Christ" signifies His role as the Messiah, and "Lord" denotes His divine authority. This title affirms the early Christian confession of Jesus as both Savior and Sovereign, a central tenet of the faith. It also connects to Old Testament prophecies of the coming Messiah and the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the fulfillment of those prophecies.<p><b>is faithful</b><br>The faithfulness of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. It assures believers of God's reliability and trustworthiness in fulfilling His promises. This faithfulness is demonstrated in His covenant with Israel and ultimately in the sending of His Son. In the context of 1 Corinthians, it reassures the church of God's steadfastness despite their struggles and divisions, encouraging them to trust in His ongoing work in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The supreme being, creator, and sustainer of the universe, who is faithful and has called believers into fellowship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, through whom believers are called into fellowship.

He is personal, active, and sovereign, guiding history and individual believers alike (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>).<p>- By naming God first, Paul reminds the Corinthians that their identity and security rest in who He is, not in their own achievements or failures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has called you</b><p>- &#8220;Call&#8221; is a deliberate, saving summons, not a casual invitation.
