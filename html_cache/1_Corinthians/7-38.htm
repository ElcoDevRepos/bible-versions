The phrase "he who marries the virgin does well" reflects the cultural and historical context of first-century Corinth, where marriage was a societal norm and often seen as a duty. The term "virgin" here refers to an unmarried woman, highlighting the cultural emphasis on purity before marriage. Biblically, marriage is honored (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>), and Paul acknowledges that marrying is a good and honorable choice. This aligns with <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where marriage is instituted by God. <p><b>but he who does not marry her does even better</b><br>Paul suggests that singleness can be preferable, especially in the context of serving the Lord without distraction (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32-35</a>). This reflects the eschatological urgency of the early church, anticipating Christ's return. Singleness allows for undivided devotion to God, echoing Jesus' own life and ministry. Paul&#8217;s advice is not a command but a recommendation based on the present circumstances (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>). This perspective is consistent with the idea that one's status, whether married or single, should be used to glorify God (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community dealing with issues of morality, spiritual gifts, and church order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virgin.htm">The Virgin</a></b><br>Refers to an unmarried woman, often highlighting the cultural and religious expectations of purity and marriage in the early Christian context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_contextual_advice.htm">Understanding Contextual Advice</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s advice is specific to the Corinthian context, where persecution and distress were prevalent.

Choosing to remain single for kingdom purposes is &#8220;even better&#8221; when it frees the believer to serve Christ with singular devotion. Scripture affirms the literal goodness of marriage and the strategic advantage of celibacy, leaving each disciple to follow the Lord&#8217;s leading with confidence that His Word is true and sufficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">So then . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">So then he that gives his daughter in marriage does well, and</span> (not "but") h<span class= "ital">e that giveth her not shall do better.</span> It is worth noticing how, in the case of the one who gives his daughter in marriage, we have the present tense "does well"--as if the good he did began and ended there; and, in the other case, the future "shall do" (in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-37.htm" title="Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.">1Corinthians 7:37</a> also)--the good result of his action continuing while the girl remains with her parent. This passage clearly shows how St. Paul has not been contrasting right and wrong: but comparative degrees of what is expedient.<p>All throughout this passage the Apostle takes for granted the absolute control of the parent over the child, in accordance with the principles of both Greek and Jewish jurisprudence. Hence, no advice is given to the young maiden herself, but only to her father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doeth well.</span> Because" marriage is honourable in all." <span class="cmt_word">Doeth better</span>. Obviously not <span class="accented">morally</span>, because, if one course be <span class="accented">morally</span> better than another, we are bound to take it; but "better" with reference to expediency in "the urgent necessity" which rested on the Christian world in that day. It is quite clear that, if these words are meant to disparage matrimony in comparison with celibacy, or to treat celibacy in the abstract as a holier state that marriage, they have been set aside by the universal practice and theory of the Christian world. But, as we have seen, they are expressed by St. Paul only as a relative and diffident opinion. It is remarkable that not one word is said as to the choice of the virgin herself in the matter, which is one of the most essential points on which the decision must turn. St. Paul, no doubt, assumes the acquiescence or preference of the maiden as one of the elements in the absence of any "need" for her marriage; but also he writes after lifelong familiarity with the all but absolute control exercised by Jewish parents over their youthful daughters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8045;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
