This reflects his pastoral care and commitment to nurturing the spiritual growth of the believers. The use of "perhaps" suggests flexibility and reliance on God's guidance, a theme consistent with <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>, where believers are encouraged to submit their plans to the Lord's will. Paul's itinerant ministry required adaptability, as seen throughout Acts, where the Holy Spirit often directed his travels.<p><b>or even spend the winter</b><br>Winter travel in the ancient Mediterranean was perilous due to weather conditions, making it common for travelers to settle in one place during this season. This practical consideration highlights Paul's wisdom and understanding of the times. The mention of winter also suggests a longer stay, allowing for deeper teaching and fellowship. This aligns with <a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, where Paul reminds the Ephesian elders of his three-year ministry among them, emphasizing the importance of prolonged discipleship.<p><b>so that you can help me on my journey</b><br>Paul often relied on the support of local churches for his missionary journeys, both in prayer and material assistance. This reflects the early church's communal nature, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared resources. The Corinthian church's involvement in Paul's mission underscores the interconnectedness of the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where each member plays a vital role in the mission of the church.<p><b>wherever I go</b><br>Paul's open-ended statement indicates his readiness to follow God's leading without a fixed destination. This mirrors the call of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, who was asked to go to a land God would show him, demonstrating faith and obedience. Paul's missionary journeys, recorded in Acts, were marked by divine direction, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>, where the Holy Spirit guided him to Macedonia. This phrase encapsulates the essence of a life surrendered to God's purposes, trusting Him for guidance and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians.

He holds his itinerary loosely (see <a href="/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19</a>; <a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>), yet he openly yearns for meaningful time with the Corinthian believers. After years of laboring among churches, he still values face-to-face fellowship (<a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36-38</a>). The verse pictures a shepherd eager to linger with his flock for their benefit and his refreshment (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or even spend the winter</b><p>Winter seas in the ancient Mediterranean were treacherous (<a href="/acts/27-9.htm">Acts 27:9-12</a>), so extended residence made practical sense. More importantly, months indoors would allow concentrated teaching, correction, and encouragement&#8212;exactly what this occasionally wayward church needed (<a href="/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2-3</a>). Paul had once remained in Corinth eighteen months (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>); a winter stay would echo that fruitful season and provide stability while storms raged outside.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you can help me on my journey</b><p>Biblical partnership is two-way. The apostle pours out spiritual riches; the congregation supplies material and logistical support. Such &#8220;help&#8221; includes hospitality, funding, travel companions, and prayer (<a href="/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; 3 <a href="/bsb/john/6.htm">John 6-8</a>). By investing in Paul&#8217;s next assignment, the Corinthians would share in its harvest (<a href="/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17</a>). Scripture consistently affirms this divine economy: those who proclaim the gospel and those who send them stand side by side in God&#8217;s accounting (<a href="/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wherever I go</b><p>Paul fixes his eyes beyond Corinth to the ever-widening frontier of the gospel. He remains flexible, ready for the Spirit&#8217;s next directive (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>; 19:21). The phrase highlights both certainty and mystery: certainty that he will keep moving for Christ, mystery about the precise destination. His life models obedience without conditions, echoing Abram&#8217;s call to a land God would later reveal (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a> captures a missional rhythm: linger long enough to build up believers, receive their loving support, then launch out again under God&#8217;s guidance. Paul&#8217;s tentative plans teach reliance on divine timing; his willingness to winter underscores pastoral care; his expectation of assistance affirms mutual responsibility; his open-ended route showcases fearless commitment to the Great Commission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And it may be that I will abide . . .</span>--His former plan had involved but a brief visit to the Church at Corinth, but the arrangement which he now contemplated would permit of a longer stay, and so he adds, with affectionate emphasis, "that <span class= "ital">you</span> may send me on my journey." Whither he would go from Corinth he had not yet determined; and, indeed, it was subsequently determined for him by a conspiracy against him, which was fortunately discovered in time (<a href="/acts/20-3.htm" title="And there stayed three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.">Acts 20:3</a>). He remained three mouths at Corinth, during winter, and, as that brought him to a time of year when a voyage would be safe, he resolved to sail into Syria. The conspiracy of the Jews caused this plan to be abandoned, and a different course, through Troas, &c., adopted. (See <a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>; <a href="/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>; <a href="/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17</a>.) The phrase "that ye may send me on" implies not merely that Corinth should be the starting-point of his journey to Jerusalem, but that he should set out on that journey with the good wishes and blessing of his Corinthian friends (as in <a href="/acts/20-38.htm" title="Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.">Acts 20:38</a>; <a href="/acts/21-5.htm" title="And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.">Acts 21:5</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and winter with you.</span> This he did (<a href="/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may bring me on my journey.</span> The "ye" is emphatic.
