Prayer signifies communication with God, while prophecy involves speaking forth God's message, often under divine inspiration. The Apostle Paul addresses the conduct of men during these spiritual activities, emphasizing the importance of maintaining proper decorum in worship settings. This reflects the broader biblical principle of reverence and order in worship, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, where men are encouraged to pray with holy hands lifted without anger or disputing.<p><b>with his head covered</b><br>In the cultural context of Corinth, head coverings held significant social and religious connotations. For men, wearing a head covering during worship could symbolize submission or shame, contrary to the cultural norms of the time. In Jewish tradition, men often covered their heads as a sign of respect and humility before God, but in the Greco-Roman world, uncovered heads were a sign of honor and authority. Paul's instruction here may reflect a desire to distinguish Christian practices from those of other religious groups and to uphold the cultural understanding of male authority and honor.<p><b>dishonors his head</b><br>The term "head" can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it refers to the physical head of the man, but metaphorically, it can signify authority or leadership. In <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, Paul states that "the head of every man is Christ," suggesting that a man dishonors Christ by covering his head during prayer or prophecy. This act could be seen as a rejection of the authority and glory that Christ bestows upon men. The concept of honor and shame was deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of the time, and maintaining one's honor was crucial in both personal and communal contexts. This phrase underscores the importance of aligning one's actions with the established order and roles within the Christian faith, as further elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, where Christ is described as the head of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The

setting, men normally worshiped with heads uncovered, while pagan priests often veiled themselves. Paul distinguishes Christian worship from pagan practice.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a> shows Moses veiling himself to hide God&#8217;s fading glory, but Christians, reflecting Christ&#8217;s enduring glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>), have no need to cover.<p>&#8226; The uncovered head visually proclaims that nothing stands between the man and his Head, Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Dishonors his head</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Head&#8221; carries a double sense:<p>&#8211; His physical head, whose uncovered state should testify to Christ&#8217;s unveiled relationship with him.<p>&#8211; His spiritual Head, Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, &#8220;Christ is the head of the church, His body&#8221;).<p>&#8226; To act contrary to God&#8217;s order brings shame; it signals a refusal to acknowledge Christ&#8217;s authority and mars the testimony of the church before onlookers (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/11-4.htm">1 Corinthians 11:4</a> teaches that when a man leads in prayer or prophecy, he must keep his head uncovered to honor Christ, his spiritual Head. Doing so affirms God-ordained roles, distinguishes Christian worship from pagan rituals, and visually upholds the glory of Christ before the gathered church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Every man praying or prophesying.</span>--The reference here is to public prayer and teaching (the word "prophesying" is used in its less restricted sense). The Apostle probably does not allude to any case in Corinth where a man had actually taken part in a religious meeting with covered head. The Greek practice was for men to have their heads uncovered when joining in religious ceremonies (Grotius <span class= "ital">in loc.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> To this practice St. Paul would incline, as being the national custom of the country, and as also being typical of the distinction between the sexes which he has just laid down. The Apostle's teaching on this subject is a remarkable illustration of how completely he had overcome his old Jewish prejudice, and how the whole of his nature had become leavened with the freedom of the gospel--for it was the custom amongst the Jews for the man to pray with covered head, and the face veiled with the <span class= "ital">Tallith,</span> as an expression of his unworthiness to speak face to face with God. It was a profound insight into human nature which enabled the Apostle to realise how an external symbol would infallibly tend to modify doctrine, and how thus the perpetuating of such a custom in the Christian Church might have hindered the full recognition of the great truth of the personal and direct communication of every individual soul with the Father.<p><span class= "bld">Dishonoureth his head.</span>--He dishonours his own head inasmuch as it is the part of his body from which Christ has taken His title as "Head of the Body," the Church--and thus he dishonours his Spiritual Head. even Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesying</span>; that is, <span class="accented">preaching. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Having his head covered.</span> This was a Jewish custom. The Jewish worshipper in praying always covers his head with his <span class="accented">tallith.</span> The Jew (like Orientals generally) uncovered his feet because the place on which he stood was holy ground; but he covered his head by way of humility, even as the angels veil their faces with their wings. AEneas is said by Servius to have introduced this custom into Italy. On the other hand, the Greek custom was to pray with the head uncovered. St. Paul - as some discrepancy of custom seems to have arisen - decided in favour of the Greek custom, on the high ground that Christ, by his incarnation, became man, and therefore the Christian, who is" in Christ," may stand with unveiled head in the presence of his Father<span class="cmt_word">. Dishonoureth his head</span>. He dishonoureth his own head, which is as it were a sharer in the glory of Christ, who is Head of the whole Church. "We pray," says Tertullian, "with bare heads because we blush not." The Christian, being no longer a slave, but a son (<a href="/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>), may claim his part in the glory of the eternal Son. The head was covered in <span class="accented">mourning</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>), and the worship of the Christian is joyous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/11-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Every</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
