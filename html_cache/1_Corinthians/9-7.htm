This rhetorical question highlights the expectation that those who serve in a dedicated capacity, such as soldiers, are supported by those they serve. The Apostle Paul uses this analogy to argue for the right of apostles and ministers to receive material support from the communities they serve. This concept is consistent with the Old Testament, where Levites, who served in the temple, were supported by the tithes of the people (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>). The imagery of a soldier also connects to the spiritual warfare theme found in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God.<p><b>Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit?</b><br>Vineyards were a common agricultural endeavor in the ancient Near East, and those who planted and tended them were entitled to enjoy the fruits of their labor. This principle is rooted in the law of Moses, which allowed workers to partake of the produce they helped cultivate (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>). The vineyard is also a frequent biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), symbolizing God's care and expectation of fruitfulness from His people. In the New Testament, Jesus uses the vineyard imagery in parables to teach about the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/20.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>; <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>), emphasizing the relationship between labor and reward.<p><b>Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?</b><br>Shepherding was a vital occupation in biblical times, and shepherds were entitled to benefit from the resources of the flock, such as milk. This analogy underscores the principle that those who provide care and oversight should receive sustenance from their work. The imagery of shepherding is rich throughout Scripture, with God Himself depicted as the Shepherd of Israel (Psalm 23; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). Jesus Christ is identified as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>), who lays down His life for the sheep, illustrating the ultimate provision and care. This phrase reinforces the idea that spiritual leaders, like shepherds, deserve to be supported by those they nurture and guide.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Governments or commanding officers supply what they need.<p>&#8226; This comparison underscores the principle that those engaged full-time in a mission are supplied by the ones who benefit from that mission.<p>&#8226; Cross references reinforce it: <a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a> urges believers to &#8220;endure hardship as good soldiers,&#8221; reminding us that a soldier avoids civilian entanglements so he can &#8220;please the one who enlisted him.&#8221; Likewise <a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> teaches, &#8220;The worker is worthy of his wages,&#8221; laying a foundation for material support of gospel workers.<p>&#8226; Paul is saying, If earthly armies understand this, shouldn&#8217;t the church?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit?</b><p>&#8220;Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>b)<p>&#8226; A vintner naturally samples his own grapes; it would be unthinkable to toil in the hot sun only to be forbidden the harvest.<p>&#8226; This example draws from Old Testament law: <a href="/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a> notes that a man who has planted a vineyard should enjoy its fruit before going to war. God Himself built this right into Israel&#8217;s civil life.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18</a> adds, &#8220;He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,&#8221; confirming that labor and reward rightly go together.<p>&#8226; By evoking vineyard imagery, Paul quietly links back to Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-8</a>, where believers are branches drawing life from the true Vine. Spiritual fruit is produced through ministry, and it is reasonable for those cultivating the vineyard of God&#8217;s people to receive sustenance from it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?</b><p>&#8220;Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>c)<p>&#8226; Shepherding demands constant watchfulness; the shepherd&#8217;s livelihood is tied to the flock.

Just as sheep provide milk, congregations should meet the basic needs of those who guide and protect them.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; words in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&#8221;&#8212;underline the sacrificial nature of ministry, yet even sacrificial service deserves practical support.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>By stacking three everyday illustrations&#8212;soldier, vintner, shepherd&#8212;Paul builds an unassailable case: it is both natural and biblical for those who labor in gospel ministry to receive material support from the people they serve. While Paul sometimes waived that right for strategic reasons (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>), the principle stands. God cares for His workers through His people, ensuring that the mission advances unhindered and His servants are provided for.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Who goeth a warfare any time at his own</span> <span class= "bld">charges?</span>--Three illustrations from human life and business show that the principle which has been adopted in the Christian Church is not exceptional. A soldier receives his pay; the planter of a vineyard eats the fruit of it; and the owner of a flock is supported by selling the milk. The best MSS. omit the word "of" before "fruit." It probably crept into later texts from the occurrence of that word with the "milk"; but a vineyard owner actually eats his fruit, whereas not only would it be strange to speak of "eating" milk, but the owner of flocks would really be sustained chiefly by the sale of the milk and the purchase of food with the money so obtained. He would eat "of" the milk. It is worth noticing that St. Paul never (with the one exception of <a href="/context/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28-29</a>) takes up the image supplied by the Lord Himself of Christ being the Shepherd, and the Church His flock. Even here, where the occurrence of the word "flock" must have suggested it, it is not alluded to. On the other hand, St. Peter's favourite image is that of "the flock." The command, "Feed My flock," would have made it touchingly familiar to him. St. Paul's imagery from nature and country life are on the practical rather than the poetic side; whereas his images from military, political, and social life have the vivid reality which we should expect from one whose life was spent chiefly in towns. It has been observed that St. Paul's vindication falls naturally into three divisions.
